# Enabling the Discovery of Thematically Related Research Objects with Spatializations

**Motivation**: To facilitate the discovery of related research objects in the multidisciplinary context of a university 

**Goal**: To produce spatializations that enable scholars to explore the thematic similarity of research resources by linking existing spatialization techniques to [core concepts of spatial information](<http://spatial.ucsb.edu/core-concepts-of-spatial-information/>)

**Implementation**: Two spatialized views of a repository of masters and doctoral theses available through the [Alexandria Digital Research Library](<https://alexandria.ucsb.edu/collections/f3348hkz>)
