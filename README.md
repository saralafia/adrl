# Enabling the Discovery of Related Research with Spatialized Library Interfaces

**Goal**: To produce spatialized interfaces that enable users to explore the thematic similarity of research resources by linking existing spatialization techniques to [core concepts of spatial information](<http://spatial.ucsb.edu/core-concepts-of-spatial-information/>)

**Motivation**: To facilitate the discovery of related research resources in the multidisciplinary context of a university library 

**Implementation**: We develop two spatialized views of a collection of masters and doctoral theses available through the [Alexandria Digital Research Library](<https://alexandria.ucsb.edu/collections/f3348hkz>)
