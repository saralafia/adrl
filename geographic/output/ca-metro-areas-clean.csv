1359,"Mississippi West: Race, Politics, and Civil Rights in California's Central Valley, 1947--1984","The history of race, politics, and civil rights in California's Central Valley is an important yet understudied aspect of multiracial history in the American West. Kern County and the city of Bakersfield were critical epicenters of civil rights activism during the twentieth century. Simultaneously, an equally active and sometimes hostile, conservative resistance toward labor and civil rights existed in the region. In the immediate post-World War II era, Mexican Americans built racial coalitions with African Americans and white liberals to challenge racial segregation and discrimination in housing and employment. In the ensuing decades, the war on poverty, farmworker, and Chicana/o power movements impacted racial coalition building and civil rights reform in complex ways, including struggles over increased political representation for racial minorities, expansion of rural-migrant health care, and school desegregation. Since World War II through the rise of the modern political right, Mexican immigrants and their descendants shaped rural and urban civil rights reform in California's interior. This dissertation draws upon several archival repositories related to labor and civil rights history in California's Central Valley, including the collected papers of the United Farm Workers (UFW), the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Region I, West Coast Branch (NAACP-WC), the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), as well as previously unexamined personal paper collections of Bakersfield civil rights leaders and politicians. Referred to pejoratively as ""Mississippi West"", given the county's vibrant history of civil rights activism and antistatist opposition toward civil rights, Kern County is ground-zero for a massive demographic transformation from a white to Hispanic majority; a trend other U.S. regions will experience in the coming decades. The history of race relations, civil rights, and politics in the region sheds light on the importance of a burgeoning Latino population, as well as marks a bellwether for future U.S. social and political trends in California and beyond.",Bakersfield,,
270,The consequences of fishing-induced changes in predator size for predator-prey interactions,"Body size has long been recognized as a key driver of species interactions and of an individual's role in the ecosystem. Body size determines the amount, species, and sizes of prey resources an individual can consume, as well as its own susceptibility to predators. Human harvest of predators can result in severe truncations in predator body size that can have cascading consequences on food webs. Where small and large individuals of the same species differ greatly in their diets, as is common in aquatic systems, the absence of large predators may functionally eliminate a key predator-prey linkage. Recently management agencies have begun to include size-based metrics as targets. As various harvest strategies differentially affect predator size and biomass, the research presented in this dissertation aims to understand the conditions under which truncations in predator size structure will result in additional loss of predator function than would be predicted from predator biomass alone, and where it will therefore be important to maintain predator size distributions. I specifically examine how the type of ontogenetic shift in diet (e.g. prey species or size class), and the shape of the diet switching function (e.g. gradual or abrupt) will affect the consequences of the loss of the largest predators, and the relative utility of various management strategies in maintaining predator function. In Chapter 1, I examined the tradeoffs between fishery yield and predator function in the ecosystem when preferentially fishing the largest predators. I found that fisheries that delay harvest until large predator sizes maximize fishery yield but that this virtually eliminates predation on focal prey eaten late in life history when diet shifts are abrupt and occur at or after the size at maturity. In this case, there is a clear tradeoff between fisheries and ecosystem objectives. Instead, where shifts in diet toward late prey are more gradual, targeting the largest predators can achieve a win-win by maximizing yield and achieving predation rates similar to that with other strategies that harvest predators earlier. As such, the optimal fishing strategy to achieve both single-species and ecosystem benefits depends strongly on the interaction between the fishery selectivity pattern and the changes in predator diet with size. In Chapter 2, I quantified the size-dependence of the predator-prey interaction between herbivorous sea urchins and one of their important predators in southern California kelp forests, California Sheephead. I further examined the consequences of changes in sheephead size and abundance in marine reserves at Catalina Island on size-specific urchin mortality in field predation trials. In my observations of predation of sheephead on urchins, sheephead smaller than 20cm TL do not eat urchins of any size. Thereafter, small sheephead only consumed small urchins, with larger sheephead sizes needed to successfully consume larger urchins, and the largest sheephead preferentially targeted the largest urchins. Inside marine reserves at Catalina, the greater abundance of large sheephead in combination with the observed size-specific capacities for urchin predation led to higher urchin mortality with marine reserve protection, particularly for the largest urchins. Ultimately, by restoring predator size structure, reserves may serve to enhance the resilience of southern California kelp forests. In Chapter 3, I examined how variation in predator body size distributions and biomass affects the likelihood of size escapes in situations where predators begin eating prey at some threshold size and thereafter consume increasingly larger prey. We focus on California sheephead because of the size dependence of its interaction with herbivorous sea urchins (Chapter 2), and the natural variation in demography where sheephead achieve smaller maximum sizes but higher biomass in the south of its range. We evaluate the consequences of smaller predator body size on top-down control of urchin populations in two scenarios: 1) when overall predator abundance is the same as the population with larger body size, and 2) when predator biomass is the same. With the same numbers of predators, top-down control was significantly weakened by the lack of large sheephead. However, when sheephead biomass was maintained, the absence of large sheephead did not lead to greater urchin abundance, despite lower predation rates overall and much lower predation on large urchins. Higher predation rates on the smallest urchin size classes served as a bottleneck that kept total urchin population at similar levels and prevented a size escape for the largest urchins. This suggests that where predators switch prey size classes in the same species, the loss of the largest individuals does not inherently result in weaker top-down control, if biomass is maintained, but effective control is sensitive to prey growth rates. The results of this research suggest that the ignoring shifts in predator size structure can under-estimate the effects of fishing on predator function, especially when large predators eat different species than their smaller counterparts. High predator biomass can compensate when diet shifts are to different prey size classes of the same species. Concordance between diet shifts and fishery selectivity can help identify where it will be important to consider changes in predator size in addition to biomass.",Concord,,
911,"Truth, Justice, and the Performative Way! Superhero Performance and the Battle for Social Justice in Twenty-First Century America","Who is Barack Obama? Contrary to the rumors you have heard, I was not born in a manger. I was actually born on Krypton, and sent here by my father, Jor-El, to save the planet Earth. ---Barack Obama, Oct. 17, 2008. Appearing simultaneously in major blockbuster films, Broadway musicals, and many other media formats, the ubiquitous superhero remains one of America's most enduring cultural icons. Shrewdly, Obama spoke the words above just before the 2008 election and hitched his political performance to the popular mythology of Superman. Multiple representations of ""Super-Obama"" soon followed across diverse media platforms as he transformed from mild-mannered candidate to a political superhero charged with saving America. Appropriating the iconography of Superman, Obama tapped into that famous mantra of ""truth, justice and the American way,"" and joined the growing social practice of Americans portraying themselves as superheroes to challenge unjust assumptions about class, gender, sexual identity, and race. In shedding their seemingly disempowered everyday identities and donning the theatricalized forms of their pop cultural heroes, these performers restage themselves as the physical and political ideals of Americanism. Obama, in casting himself as Superman, laid claim to the ultimate jingoistic representation of white heterosexual maleness despite being a biracial liberal whom his opposition portrays as ""soft"" on terrorism. I argue that by embodying the superhero, Barack Obama and others distanced from that supposed ideal of Americanism, turn popular myths back on those in power. They debunk the ""truth"" of America's social divisions, demand greater advances in social justice, and explore a new American way that subverts the social inequalities of twenty-first century America. Deceptively multifaceted, the superhero emerged as a uniquely American literary creation, though one largely written off as escapist fare for puerile minds. As this project demonstrates, the superhero actually represents a complex unraveling of embedded mythologies including those of American exceptionalism and the American Dream. Superheroes possess surprising ambiguity as equally strong icons of social progress and also brash defenders of the social status-quo. Most scholarship on the superhero focuses on mediatized appearances (Jenkins, Gordon) or a combination of comic book history and semiotics (Eco, Bukatman, Singer). I build upon their methods by applying theories of performance and theatricality as tools that visually modify and overwrite reality with illusion (Davis & Postlewait, Burns). Ultimately, I investigate how adopting the superhero form allows Americans to combat social inequities in the age of Obama. Though some forces assert that Obama's presidency proves that boundaries of class, gender, sexual identity, and race are no longer insurmountable, I expose that these inequalities remain and are being restaged in the rhetoric of superheroes. By embodying the anarchist ""hero"" Citizen V from the comic book and film V for Vendetta, some members of the Occupy Movement threaten revolution while demanding the end of economic inequalities. Additionally, my ethnographic study at Comic-Con International, the world's largest convention celebrating the popular arts, critiques the gender-bending and race-bending practice of ""crossplayers,"" costumed attendees who switch the genders and perceived races of popular superheroes in their performances and subvert associations of white maleness. Similarly, I argue that the superhero allows gay revelers at superhero-themed parties to deny their marginalized status by adopting and distorting the masculine ideal he represents. I then illustrate how even Barack Obama's rise to the presidency utilized superhero imagery and its associations with nationalism and physical power, providing a biracial candidate with access to the utopic whiteness of Superman. My dissertation brings vital scholarly attention to the ways in which superhero performance may challenge popular culture's continual re-inscription of the values of white, heterosexual maleness. I expose that the superhero's prevalence in popular culture grants all Americans a shared language and cultural currency that can be used even by the disenfranchised to make their voices heard. Thus these progressive superhero performances work as benchmarks by which we may measure and question the state of social equality in America today.",Davis,,
1405,"The Global Potentials for Humanized Birth---Birth Stories from the Yayasan Bumi Sehat Birth Clinic in Bali, Indonesia","Since the natural childbirth movement of the 1960's and 1970's in the United States and in parts of Europe, many scholars, activists, doctors and midwives have exposed the failures of the Western, medical model of birthing to provide women-centered care in childbirth (Arms, 1975; Davis-Floyd, 2011; Edwards, 2005; Gaskin, 2003; Jordan, 1978; Klaus, 2002; Mongan, 2005; Odent, 2002; Simkin, 2008; Wagner, 2001). However, during the 20th and 21st centuries, as international development processes and hegemonic global norms have been increasingly disseminated through the processes of globalization, the Western medical model for birthing has spread around the globe (Davis-Floyd, 1997; Jordan, 1978). This thesis asks what the global potentials are for humanized birth as a means to reduce maternal mortality in a women-centered way. Through the collection of birth stories from 13 women who birthed at the Yayasan Bumi Sehat Birth Clinic in Bali, Indonesia at the end 2011, the value of the humanized birth model is explored as it contrasts the Western, technocratic, medical model of birth (Bumi Sehat Foundation, 2012; Davis- Floyd, 200; Umenai et al. 2001; Wagner, 2001). In this thesis, women's stories are valued as research evidence with particular relevance to policy guidance in support of the humanized birthing method (Carolan, 2006; VandeVusse, 1999).",Davis,,
1467,We're Not Alone: An Analysis of the Relationship Between Program Design and Teacher Candidate Interaction and Support in a Teacher Education Program Employing a Cohort System,"There is very little evidence regarding the specifics of how teacher candidates in preservice teacher education programs employing a cohort system interact and support one another. Similarly, there have been calls for more evidence of the specifics of the socialization process of teacher candidates, especially as it relates to the relationship between program design and peer interaction and support within a cohort. Utilizing a situated learning perspective and ethnographic tools (Green, Dixon & Zaharlick, 2002), observations and interviews were conducted of teacher candidates and their instructors and supervisors, both at the university and in the partner schools, over the course of a full academic year. Using the full year of field experience as a lens for the analysis, a recursive relationship between teacher education program design, peer interaction and support and the socialization process was found. The willingness and ability of the teacher candidates to support and learn from one another was facilitated by certain elements of program design. First, the number and variety of cross-disciplinary, mini-cohorts the program placed them in over the course of the year put them in close proximity to a large number of their peers, exposing them to a wide range of expertise. Second, the safe spaces created for them by clinical faculty at the partner schools and by program administration and faculty at the university enabled them to discuss, reflect, and problem-solve openly. Finally, the program design gave teacher candidates multiple support options throughout the year, rather than just one cooperating teacher, and the evidence showed that the teacher candidates explored those multiple options. The findings point to the cohort system as a design that can facilitate peer interaction and support. For programs that do not employ a cohort system, the findings indicate that peer interaction and support is likely to result from encouraging collaboration and communication across disciplines. The need for teacher candidates to be socialized into school cultures by mentors familiar with the particulars of the school and placed in mini-cohorts to share their experiences is also a finding that cuts across all teacher education programs.",Dixon,,
237,Seismic Noise Analysis to Constrain Shallow Velocity Structure in the southern San Andreas Fault Region,"The seismic velocity structure in the southern San Andreas Fault region is characterized by a known, distinct seismic velocity contrast on opposite sides of the fault, with a thick sedimentary region on the west side (Salton Sea area). Reverberations would affect the duration of shaking for El Centro, Mexicali, and other communities in the Coachella Valley and Imperial Valley. Furthermore, there are other areas where deep basins are bounded by faults that could have similar effects. Therefore, being able to determine the 3D structure is a critical facet of assessing the overall seismic hazard for structures on such basins. By utilizing the particle motion of surface waves, we are able extract useful information about the S-wave velocity structure. To accomplish this, we measured Rayleigh-wave ellipticity of continuous broadband data from 2010 to 2014 for 67 stations within the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN). Measurements of Rayleigh-wave ellipticity were computed as the ratio between the vertical and horizontal amplitudes. Regional variations in the Rayleigh-wave ellipticity measurements at frequencies of 0.10 Hz up to and including 0.30 Hz illuminate small ellipticity values (i.e. horizontal elongation in Rayleigh-wave particle motion) across the entire frequency band in the regions specific to the thick sedimentary region. In this region, minimum ellipticity values (<0.20) observed at 0.10 Hz, 0.15 Hz, and at 0.20 Hz show a gradual increase up to 0.60 between 0.25 Hz to 0.40 Hz. In most areas exterior to the thick sedimentary region, ellipticity values are generally constant across the frequency band and are significantly higher (>0.90). The observed, small ellipticity values, which are characteristic of a slow velocity layer at shallow depths (upper 5-10 km), could have significant implications on the S-wave velocity structure. As the ZH-Ratio method is highly sensitive to the near-surface structure, combination of the ellipticity data with phase velocity data measured via noise cross-correlation could provide further compelling insight in the shallow S-wave velocity structure, particularly in the upper 5 km.",El Centro,,
60,Effects of fish movement and environmental variability in the design and success of a marine protected area,"Marine Protected Areas (MPA) are broadly used to protect marine ecosystems, restore biomass, and increasingly as tools in fisheries management for benthic stocks. Nevertheless, MPAs are seldom used to target pelagic species due the challenges of designing an effective MPA in a highly dynamic environment. It is believed that highly mobile organisms will get few benefits, since they leave the protected area too frequently. One possible solution is to compensate for such movement with larger MPAs. Nevertheless, uncertainty about the benefits in the face of vagaries about fish movement make it unlikely that such efforts would be successfully pursued. Although it is a generally accepted that MPAs provide multiple benefits if well designed, empirical demonstrations of benefits from MPA are hard to obtain. They require long term evaluations, and as a consequence, comparisons between alternative MPA designs are almost nonexistent. Simulation models provide an alternative to empirical approaches that allow tests of designs and forecasts of potential outcomes. To date, most of the simulation models of MPAs have been developed for benthic systems, where simplified assumptions about fish and fisherman movement are reasonable. Fortunately, with the advent of more realistic fish movement models, new approaches are now possible that can combine complex individual-based models of movement, population dynamics and virtual MPA systems. The use of these new complex simulation models can guide the optimization of MPA design to increase both stock sizes and fisheries yields. The goal of the research presented in this dissertation is to study the potential of a large MPA to protect a pelagic stock and determine how fish movement characteristics and complex environmental dynamics influence the optimal design criteria for a successful pelagic MPA. The findings are timely given increasing interest in developing large no fishing zones to protect overfished pelagic stocks, especially for those taxa whose distribution spans more than one exclusive economic zone or resides in international waters. For this purpose I implemented a simulation model that incorporates detailed fish movement and their responses to complex environmental forcing to study the effect of fish movement on the efficacy of MPAs of different size and location.

169,Programming Environments for Children : Creating a Language that Grows with you,"Block-based programming environments let children create complex, visual programs without worrying about compiling or syntax errors. This paper describes the research studies completed in the design and implementation of block-based programming environments created alongside the development of KELP-CS, a computational thinking curriculum for 4th --- 6th grade. Both the programming environment and curriculum were piloted in schools across California as part of a design-based research project. Recent efforts have increased the number of elementary and middle schools teaching computer science --- but do they have the right tools for the job? Elementary school teachers are usually responsible for teaching all subjects, and often do not have a background or training in computer science. Fourth through sixth grade students are still developing their math and reading skills as well as learning how to type and use computers. Fortunately, computer science is one of the only domains that can adapt to meet the needs of the user. Unlike math or physics, computer science has few constants; computers, languages, and development environments have changed over the last decades and will continue to evolve. How can programming languages and environments better meet the needs of upper elementary classes learning computer science? This paper looks at designing block-based programming environments for upper elementary school students as a part of a larger research study on early computer science education.",Fortuna,,
730,El otro religioso en la literatura decimononica: Protestantes en la novela espanola (1850-1890),"During the time period studied, religious liberty and Catholicism's role as a unifying force in Spanish society and an essential element of Spanish identity are fervently contested topics. The historical vicissitudes of the period---an unsuccessful attempt to introduce religious freedom during the Bienio Liberal (1854-56), the Revolution of 1868 and introduction of religious freedom in the Constitution of 1869, the evanescent First Spanish Republic, the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy and limiting of religious freedoms in the Constitution of 1876---frame the presence of competing ideologies. In this context, Protestant missionaries and colporteurs actively proselytize in Spain, a generation of Spanish Protestant leaders emerges, and the first congregations are established. In chapters dedicated to each author, the study investigates the representation of the Protestant ""other"", utilizing categories developed by Tzvetan Todorov to describe the encounter with the religious subaltern in the New World. While examining the function of Protestants in the texts, the study also compares and contrasts the literary figures with historical representatives of the period. The dissertation reveals that similar responses toward the Protestant ""other"" emerge in authors of different ideological persuasions and literary commitments. Whether informed by costumbrismo, romanticism, realism or naturalism, the novels inevitably advance the authors' ideological commitments, misrepresent the religious other, and/or dismiss Protestantism as a legitimate religious alternative. This dissertation examines representations of Protestants in Spanish novels published between 1850-1890, analyzing ways literary texts construct the religious ""other"". By examining novels of four important 19th century Spanish authors---Fernan Caballero (El exvoto and Lady Virginia), Jose Maria Blanco y Crespo (Luisa Bustamante, o La huerfana espanola en Inglaterra ), Benito Perez Galdos ( Rosalia, Fortunata y Jacinta, and Torquemada en la hoguera) and Emilia Pardo Bazan (La Tribuna and La prueba)---who represent distinct literary movements and ideological commitments, the study highlights ways in which the representations of Protestants advances the authors' convictions, distorts the historical presence of Protestants during the time period, and/or affirms---explicitly or implicitly, intentionally or inadvertently---notions that exclude this religious minority from full membership in society or portray Protestantism as incompatible with Spanish national identity.",Fortuna,,
1323,Towards Enabling Better Understanding and Performance for Managed Languages,"Computer systems today are ubiquitous and come in variety of forms. On the low end, there are resource-constrained battery-powered handheld devices that are widely used such as smart phones, tablets and netbooks. On the high end, there are powerful highly parallel multi-core devices such as desktops, workstations and servers. However, the diversity of these devices and the the heterogeneity of their platforms complicate software development. Developers must possess knowledge of a variety of architectures, platforms and languages in order to build, optimize, tune, and deploy software efficiently. Fortunately, there are means to facilitate software development across platforms. Revision Control (RC) systems enable concurrent collaboration between many developers with different languages and platforms expertise. Additionally, automated software deployment is made easier via across-platform software repositories that provide updates, fixes and patches. Finally, advances in managed programming languages (e.g. Java, C, Python, Ruby, JavaScript) and their managed runtime environments (MREs) simplify portable software development by abstracting the details of the target platforms. Despite their benefits, these remedies complicate understanding of software behavior and extracting performance. First, RC systems allow source code changes to be made in isolation with no regard to how different modifications interact to affect behavior and performance. Second, the ease of software deployment leads to different versions of the software being used by millions of users over diverse platforms making it difficult to reason about how the application will be used ""in the wild"". Third, MREs abstract the hardware, hinder performance understanding, and advanced MREs usually have high startup cost and footprint. They are also complex to build and maintain, particularly for Dynamic Scripting Languages (DSLs). In this dissertation, we investigate the question of whether we can devise novel profile analysis and collection techniques to address the above drawbacks and enable better understanding and improve performance of managed languages. We answer this question by exploring novel solutions that exploit the use of modern collaboration technologies, open source managed runtime systems, and popular software distribution mechanisms. Our techniques include a performance-aware RC system for Java programs, interpreter-based optimizations and remote compilation framework for DSLs. We describe each of our techniques in detail and present empirical evidence of its efficacy and potential.",Fortuna,,
1028,Everybody Gets Locked Up at Least Once in a While: Navigating the Carceral Social Order in Fresno,"This dissertation examines how criminalized affiliations are institutionalized in justice system facilities, and how people in turn use these affiliations to navigate punitive settings. My findings are based on ethnographic data collected in Fresno, CA, where I conducted 12 months of participant observation research in a juvenile hall, and in an alternative high school for youth on juvenile probation. Additionally, I recorded 70 interviews with students at the high school and with parolees returning from the adult prison system to document how their experiences in these environments shaped their worldviews. I argue that punitive institutions, such as prisons and court schools, construct criminality by institutionalizing and enforcing a ""carceral social order""---a system of social organization in which people are systematically divided by race, home communities, and personal contacts into gang-associated groups. The prison and the school separated rival gangs by dividing entire facilities, forcing all prisoners/students to pick sides. This imposed racialized gang conflicts on all prisoners/students, exposing them to confrontation and violence from their peers and gradually teaching them to frame their own racial, ethnic, and class identities through the criminalized groups there were sorted into. For many of the students, the divisiveness imposed on them in the juvenile hall and continuation school mirrored stories they had heard of the prison from incarcerated loved ones. The extensive influence of the justice system in their communities (experienced through the incarceration of relatives and neighbors as well as their own involvement in the juvenile justice system) taught youth to position themselves and others in this carceral social order by framing racial and community ties through criminalized affiliations. Many of the students and parolees claimed that these affiliations helped them access important resources and allies while in the institution. In this way these affiliations functioned as survival strategies that residents of high-incarceration communities used to manage the carceral subjectivity of their neighborhoods. However, residents' experiences navigating rivalries in these facilities also marked them with criminal labels that ultimately kept them ensnared in the justice system.",Fresno,,

Since their inception in 1997, Mujeres de Maiz has used politically and spiritually charged art that aims to challenge social injustices, revise dominant cultural representations and build meaningful communities across differences. The research was drawn from a dual method approach: textual analysis and participant observation ethnography with the MdM collective from 2009 to 2014 to examine how urban Indigenous mestiz&commat;s represent themselves in textual and social spaces. Few studies have paid attention to constructions of Chicano indigeneity, and fewer still to feminist indigeneity, in the twenty-first century that exists outside of Chicano nationalist and ""Chican&commat; indigenist"" paradigms. In contrast, this work examines the ways women shape, transform and extend Chican&commat; indigeneity and express manifestations of a ""radical indigenous mestizaje"" through their artivism. This research seeks to propel Chican&commat; Studies towards making room for a transnational feminist, hemispheric and grounded approach to indigeneity by demonstrating that these approaches are already being constructed on the ground.

172,Mapping and quantifying methane emissions from local sources using airborne imaging spectrometers,"Most of the existing techniques for detecting, quantifying, and attributing point source emissions of methane (CH4) have relied on ground-based measurements. These methods are limited either by their spatial resolution or temporal coverage, which makes identifying the location of individual sources challenging. By combining large image footprints and fine spatial resolution, airborne imaging spectrometers offer the potential to permit direct attribution of emissions to individual point sources. As part of a controlled release experiment, AVIRIS-NG was flown at multiple flight altitudes and methane flux rates to determine its sensitivity for methane detection. From these results, detection rates were calculated for multiple flux rates and indicate a detection threshold around 3.4 cubic meters per hour (0.02 kt/year). Given this threshold, AVIRIS-NG has the potential to detect a number of fugitive methane source categories for natural gas fields. Ongoing analysis of AVIRIS-NG scenes over oil and gas fields indicates multiple methane plumes, further emphasizing the utility of imaging spectrometers for direct attribution of methane emissions. This dissertation explores the potential of using imaging spectrometers like the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and the next generation sensor (AVIRIS-NG) for high resolution mapping of emissions and quantification of methane concentrations present within scenes. To do so, non-quantitative filtering methods and quantitative methane retrievals were adapted for use with AVIRIS and AVIRIS-NG scenes over both marine and terrestrial environments. These techniques were applied to scenes acquired at natural marine methane seeps (Coal Oil Point, COP) and for natural and anthropogenic sources in the Los Angeles Basin. At these locations, distinct plumes consistent with local wind direction were observed. As part of this study, I developed methods of reducing noise and false positives in results.",Los Angeles,,
187,"Representations of an Urban Neighborhood : Residents' Cognitive Boundaries of Koreatown, Los Angeles","The neighborhood has long been studied in such fields as geography, sociology, political science, and urban planning as a meaningful unit of analysis, with deep connections for residents and an ever-shifting form. This study expands on foundational research about geographic regions (particularly informal or vague cognitive regions), sense of place, and environmental and travel perception, and takes as its focal area the neighborhood of Koreatown in Los Angeles. By collecting information about residents' individual attributes, their concepts of this neighborhood region, and their travel activity within the city, I elucidate how ideas about the neighborhood fit into theories about sense of place. My work additionally demonstrates the value of surveying residents about vague concepts of local regions, and ways in which to measure and express these ideas. I conducted in-person surveys to explore the connection between residents' cognitive boundaries of Koreatown, through drawn boundaries and explanations, and their behavior within the city of LA, represented by activity space measures. In doing so, I find ways in which respondents' cognitive boundaries of the Koreatown neighborhood align with and differ from otherwise established definitions of Koreatown, presenting two methods of evaluating individual boundaries of a region. One of these ways of comparing polygons, the radial intersect method, is originally extended to the summary of multiple polygons. Collected temporary travel behavior of respondents provides a way of depicting respondents' activity spaces in the LA region for comparison with their cognitive regions. Survey data is supplemented with socio-demographic data from the Census and field observations to contextualize these findings by looking at residential clustering and ethnic composition in the neighborhood and the greater Los Angeles region. My research makes an important contribution to our understanding of the urban neighborhood through an extensive analysis of a unique ethnic enclave from the perspective of local residents in one of the nation's largest metropolises.",Los Angeles,,
292,Policing the Wretched: Transnational Apparatuses of Social Control in the Early 21st Century,"Policing the Wretched examines the transnationalization of systems of racism, class exploitation, criminalization, militarized policing, and social control throughout North and Central America in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. It provides a sociological, historical, and materialist analysis of the militarization of the Los Angeles Police Department, the policing of youth and surplus labor populations in El Salvador, the so-called ""war on drugs"" in Mexico, and the emergence of hip hop as a cultural form of expression in the heavily policed Pico Union district of Los Angeles to conceptualize what I call ""transnational apparatuses of social control"". It demonstrates that during the epoch of global capitalism, repressive nation-state apparatuses have taken transnational dimensions. It shows that these forms of social control should be understood alongside neoliberal policies such as structural adjustments programs (SAPs) and free trade policies, and the proposed ""wars"" on drugs, crime, gangs, terrorism, and anti-migrant policies in this region. It illustrates that the transnationalization of social control emerged as a response to social and economic crises that have developed from neoliberalism, racial and social inequality, and the emergence of grassroots social movements. While remaining attentive to the repressive apparatuses of social control in a transnational context, Policing the Wretched also examines how social movements in Los Angeles, Mexico City, and San Salvador have contested neoliberal policies, security initiatives, and militarization. Through interviews, participant observations, and archival research (government documents, congressional reports, and studies; presidential addresses; media sources and journalist accounts; and non-governmental literature, studies, and research) spanning three countries, the project traces the ways in which social movements in the U.S., Mexico, and El Salvador have mobilized and waged a relentless struggle over hegemony that provides an alternative social warrant that places democracy over securitization and human rights over property rights. It concludes by showing how hip hop in Los Angeles delineates acritique of transnational social control and a culture of resistance. The three different sites (Los Angeles, Mexico City, and San Salvador) exemplify the linkages of transnational methods of social control and opposition during the epoch of global capitalism.",Los Angeles,,
302,"Contested Illegality: Three Generations of Exclusion through Mexican ""Repatriation"" and the Politics of Immigration Law, 1920-2005","My research examines early twentieth-century immigration policies focusing on the experience of ""repatriation"" that tore apart Mexican and Mexican American families throughout the United States. It considers this historical moment as the ""banishment"" of U.S. citizens of Mexican descent to foreground the difference between repatriation, which implies that the person is not a citizen of a given country and banishment, referring to citizens who are banned from their home country. This discursive difference challenges much of the literature that refers to these banishments as ""repatriations"", obscuring the systematic racist and exclusionist immigration policies. The legal, social, and cultural ramifications of banishment on second and third generation descendants of U.S. citizens are largely absent in Chicana/o-Latina/o historiographies and immigration legal studies. My work takes an innovative approach in that it focuses on the prolonged consequences of immigration policies on surviving banished U.S. citizens and their descendants and the link to today's growing legally mixed-status households across the United States. My study demonstrates that U.S. immigration policies continue to ignore the long and complex Mexico-U.S. immigration relations, failing to create adequate paths to legalization for old and new generations of Mexican immigrants. This study centers on the experiences of banishment of three extended families and uses their oral histories across multiple generations to recover and rewrite the history of forced exclusion. The families are composed of surviving U.S. citizens who were banished during the early twentieth century and/or who are descendants of those survivors who have returned to the United States, some as undocumented immigrants. The participating families include the Yanez family, residing in Anaheim, California; the Molina family, spread throughout California, Alabama, and Mexico; and the Robles family, living in Pasadena, California. To allow for personal accounts as well as communal- or family-based interpretations, each family member is interviewed individually and then the entire family is interviewed collectively, providing for a multiplicity of insights and richly texture points of views. In addition to oral histories, this study mines the families' archives, which are composed of photographs, letters, and legal records detailing the experiences of banishment over the course of the twentieth century. Institutional records, including legal histories, archival materials, and demographic data housed at the National Archives in Washington D.C. and the regional branches in Los Angeles, California, as well as El Paso, Texas are used to contextualize the primary research and to reconstruct and reinterpret the immigration policies of the time. My study indicates that these families experienced repatriation in very unique ways, but with a common sense of contempt that extends across family generations, and continue to face real legal and social collateral consequences. My findings demonstrate that an almost 90-year-old unofficial, later becoming official, policy continues to classify direct descendents of banished U.S. citizens as ""illegal"" immigrants in their parents and grandparents' home country. Banishment has resulted in what I term, a transgenerational illegality, which has been nearly impossible to shake. These findings are crucial at a time where immigration remains central to national debates. The twenty original oral histories collected for this study demonstrate that, despite the subjugation of these families, the descendants found ways to challenge their ""illegal"" status, giving rise to the concept of a contested illegality..",Los Angeles,,
416,Estimating spatio-temporal trends of urban irrigation extent and rate using SPOT 5 imagery in a Mediterranean climate city,"Urban irrigation is a crucial component that influences urban water use budgets, particularly in Mediterranean climate cities where water availability is limited during dry summers. The main function of urban irrigation is to maintain landscape vegetation greenness and growth. The objectives of this study were (1) to examine the relationships and distributions among urban vegetation greenness, irrigated areas, and irrigation rates within single-family residential (SFR) areas; and (2) to assess irrigation rates via landscape vegetation water demand to better understand trends of SFR water consumption. A time series of SPOT 5 satellite images (10-m resolution) was used to derive a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) thresholding approach for mapping irrigated areas in connection with monthly SFR water billing records for 2005-2007 in the City of Los Angeles, California. The water needs for landscape vegetation were estimated using a vegetation water demand model that included climate, vegetation, and irrigated areas variables. A water conservation ratio was calculated to elucidate the relationships between irrigation and vegetation water demand, and to assess spatio-temporal patterns of SFR outdoor water consumption. The lower vegetation greenness suggested that vegetation was enduring water-stress conditions even though estimated outdoor water consumption is typically highest in dry years. The distributions of irrigated areas, irrigation rates and vegetation greenness revealed distinct patterns of land lot sizes owned by SFR households within different areas. The results from the relationship between irrigation rates, vegetation water demand and vegetation greenness highlighted the potential applications of household irrigation systems and selection of landscape vegetation species. The irrigation rates were influenced by climate variability through different water years (i.e., precipitation and ETo). The water conservation ratio could also detect over-irrigation conditions spatially from different SFR land lot sizes, and incorporate a vegetation water demand approach.",Los Angeles,,
479,"Caught Up: Girls, Violence and Wraparound Incarceration","Caught Up follows the lives of 50 Latina girls in ""El Valle"" Juvenile Detention Center and ""Legacy"" community school located 40 miles outside of Los Angeles, CA. Their path through these two institutions reveals the accelerated fusion of California schools and institutions of confinement. For example, the connection between both of these sites is a concerted effort between Legacy Community School and El Valle administrators to provide young people with wraparound services. These well-intentioned services are designed to provide youth with support at home, at school and in the actual detention center. However, I argue that wraparound services more closely resemble a phenomenon that I call wraparound incarceration, where students cannot escape the surveillance of formal detention despite leaving the actual detention center. For young people in Legacy school, returning to El Valle became an unavoidable consequence of wraparound services.",Los Angeles,,
494,"Space, Identity, and Memory in Queer Brown Los Angeles: Finding Sequins in the Rubble","The second chapter focuses on methodology and functions as the ""decolonial"" chapter. Based on Chela Sandoval's ""methodology of the oppressed"", I trace the various technologies that LGBTQ Latinas/os employ to resist erasures and engage in processes of self-craft. I offer an interdisciplinary theoretical framework called ""finding sequins in the rubble"", a method and process that involves negotiating spaces, identities, and violence faced daily in this globalized, urban and rapidly gentrifying city. I argue that ""reading"" the queer city is a decolonizing process that involves multiple decolonial strategies for survival and self-fashioning, within and against, the erasures and violence of globalization, and hegemonic institutions and structures. Chapter 3, through photographs, spoken word, visual art and oral histories, looks at the 2006 immigrant rights marches in Los Angeles, and how LGBTQ activists and immigrants reterritorialized the city streets, creating an alternative, urban cartography, enacting ""performances of memory"". The fourth chapter maps the social landscape of religion and spirituality in LA, tracing how LGBTQ Latinos/as negotiate their spiritual lives. It focuses on two lesbian narrators, Glenda Cael, a Guatemalan immigrant who was raised in the evangelical church, and Maria Teresa Maynez Bodtcher, an ex-Mormon Chicana. Focusing on oral history interviews, literary analysis, and cemetery and grave markers as texts, the last chapter looks at AIDS and HIV, especially in the 1980s and nineties, and how its history is remembered and erased in the city. This project is a cartography of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer Latino/a Los Angeles, mapping alternative spaces-physical, ephemeral and performative- of queer Latina/o life in Los Angeles. This interdisciplinary project uses a feminist and queer of color approach to the analysis of Latina/o urban space, situating US Third World feminists and the narrators in my research as critical geographers and social semioticians. In the first chapter I argue that LGBTQ or ""queer"" brown LA, as a borderlands space, is a transnational site of gendered, raced and sexed processes and as such has experienced epistemological, curricular, representational and physical, omissions and erasures. Some of us have literally been removed. Stemming from legacies of colonialism, nationalisms and neo-liberalism, queer transnational Latina/o LA has been rendered invisible by homonationalist, racist, mainstream narratives that represent ""gay LA"" as white, middle class, and male.",Los Angeles,,
534,The Struggle to Create a Residential Community in Downtown Los Angeles,"This dissertation is a mixed methods case study of the Residential Renaissance of Downtown Los Angeles. This revitalization of the residential community was spawned by the passage of an Adaptive Reuse Ordinance by the Los Angeles City Council in 1999 enabling developers to renovate underutilized and abandoned office and commercial buildings into apartments and lofts. The first apartments renovated under this ordinance were ready for occupancy in August 2000. Following the initial success of the pioneering developers thousands of rental lofts and condominiums were constructed in the next seven years resulting in a glut of unoccupied housing units by 2008. This case study utilized a Urban Regime theoretical framework to analyze the type of regime coalition that enabled this revitalization. Data collection included archival research of Census data, government documents, business and non-profit organization reports, and newspaper and magazine articles. Active research encompassed personal interviews, focus groups and a mail survey to residents in condominiums in the Historic Core area of Downtown considered the genesis of the Residential Renaissance. Analysis of the data indicates that the City of Los Angeles has a multi-faceted urban regime coalition based upon the land use powers vested in the fifteen city council districts by the city charter. Another finding suggests that the Downtown area can be divided into spatial amenity zones that are better suited for analysis rather than the traditional districts utilized by the city planning department. A third finding indicates that the demographic group targeted by the revitalization efforts of the city, the Creative Class as identified by Richard Florida, would be better served by rental housing instead of for-sale condominiums. Finally, the health and safety issues in Skid Row, adjacent to the Historic Core, are greater challenge than the resources available to the city government can handle and additional resources from the county and state will be required to accommodate the needs of the homeless population.",Los Angeles,,
764,"What a Drag: (Re)Defining Sex, Bodies, and Identification in Gender-Bending Performance Practices","Is there a way to write about, talk about, and practice gender-bending without reinscribing the dominant cultural authority of sex? Using feminist, queer, and performance theories in conjunction with previously restricted archival material, original ethnography, and personal interviews, this dissertation illustrates how some acts of gender-bending partially or wholly escape the limiting but central definitional parameter of sex identity. The term ""gender-bending"" traditionally characterizes how an actor of one distinct, binary sex (male or female) performs a gendered illusion that fundamentally differs from his or her own ""real"" identity. A drag queen might be described as an actor who appears as a woman onstage but is, ""in actuality,"" a man. This dissertation investigates a broad range of so-called female-bodied gender-bending practices such as male impersonation in U.S. variety and vaudeville (1868-1920), androgynous cross-casting by El Teatro Campesino's teatristas (1968-1980), and contemporary drag kinging events in Los Angeles and San Francisco, CA (2008-2012). Not every gender-bending performance is intended to be an act of social contestation or to perpetuate radically queer political goals. Even liberal gender-bending practices might be constructed or interpreted via a ""reveal"" of the actor's state-defined sex identity. Close attention to specific socio-historical contexts as well as performers' overriding personal, economic, or social goals is essential in deciphering why some acts of gender-bending ultimately support dominant ideologies while others renegotiate the role of the sexed body. By investigating gender-bending intents, methods, and outcomes in the commercial venue, the civil rights struggle, and the queer domain, this dissertation demonstrates how and also why certain gender-bending strategies identify, revision, or disidentify the performer's body within the gendered performance. Based on these examples, I propose that the term gender-bending should be resignifed to encompass a myriad of non-normative identity acts such as ""female-femmeing"" and ""body-breaking."" In doing so, this term may also be used by academics and practitioners to characterize and discuss the potential in acts that express any or all social identities as unstable, including the relationship between the performer's body and the performance of identity.",Los Angeles,San Francisco,
849,"Carbon, Energy, and Genetic Exchange Among Cold Seep Microbiota","If life evolved in the oceans and marine environments offered a haven for rapid adaptation during biotic crises, then similar reservoirs should exist today where genomic diversification allows population survival during environmental disturbances. Seafloor methane seep ecosystems might represent key sources for both ancient and modern biological diversification. The potential transfer of energy and genetic information among seep microbiota remains understudied and is the focus of this dissertation. Seep organisms that obtain energy via hydrocarbon oxidation establish a diverse benthic community where microbial assemblages exhibit myriad trophic interactions. At a shallow hydrocarbon seep, offshore Goleta, CA, benthic microbial mats grow in close proximity to actively venting gas. Bacterial methanotrophs and secondary consumers of methane-derived carbon were identified in the microbial mats using a combination of genetic assays and stable isotope tracking under both natural and enrichment conditions. Direct methane consumption was linked to the family Methylococcaceae, while secondary consumers and chemoautotrophic bacteria were inferred by taxonomic affiliations. Chemosynthetic microbial communities form the foundation for deep methane seep ecosystems in the Santa Monica Basin, offshore Los Angeles, CA. Here, diverse viral lifestyles from seafloor and pelagic environments were examined through a metagenomic lens. A bacteriophage genome from seep sediments was found to encode a mechanism for self-directed protein evolution, known as a diversity generating retroelement. Similar retroelement patterns of targeted mutagenesis were identified in public sequences from a coastal methane seep, offshore Norway and from an estuarine environment at the Galapagos Islands. Viral genomes were examined from seawater near a Santa Monica Basin cold seep. Pelagic viral genomes (ssDNA) were differentiated from assembled metagenomic sequences, including bacteriophage and eukaryotic viruses. This mesopelagic virome offers insights about the simplest of encapsulated genomes that have been previously described.",Los Angeles,,
857,"The Golden Age of Gay Nightlife: Performing Glamour and Deviance in Los Angeles and West Hollywood, 1966--2013","The last five decades marked the golden age of gay nightlife as bars and clubs served as the primary social venues for marginalized gay men and lesbians in Los Angeles. The performance stages within these spaces became theaters for drag queens, actors and other performers to speak to the values and struggles of their audiences, while the dance floors granted patrons license to embody the meaning of songs and to renew themselves through improvised movement. These businesses incubated new subcultures like disco clones, lipstick lesbians, fetish queers, and queer punks that represented interventions in gay and lesbian identities. Through interviews, periodicals and extant club artifacts, I reconstruct the narratives of these entertainments not only to establish the legacy of their artists and entrepreneurs, but also to expose the mechanism by which gay nightlife has transformed sexual norms and popular culture in the United States. This dissertation examines how the gay and lesbian communities of Los Angeles have deployed nightlife to define, contest and promote themselves in the years following the birth of gay liberation. The circulation of bodies throughout the club space demonstrated the agency of participants in their interactions with various artists as well as the potential for creative and sexual connections among individuals. Gay clubs constitute spectators as co-producers of entertainment with paid performers, and empower political dissenters and sexual deviants to experiment with performance modes and corporeal experiences. Within the artistic and social laboratories of the clubs, these performances of glamour and deviance interrogated queerness and heteronormativity alike and functioned as catalysts for radical change in nightlife and beyond.",Los Angeles,,
909,Host & Server: The Cultural Production of Temporariness in Global Cities,"Host & Server traces the contemporary global shift away from the permanent and the national toward the temporary and transnational in the global cities of Dubai, Los Angeles, and Ho Chi Minh City/Saigon. The term ""temporariness"" is used to conceptualize the structures of feeling that emerge alongside the growing phenomena of provisional labor and transitory migration that correspond with the increase of globalization and neoliberalism of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. These rapidly growing cities are icons of the opportunity and development offered by the promises of globalization and neoliberal economic policies, which have ushered in increased free trade, deregulation, and privatization since the 1980s. The dissertation argues that the opportunities and promises of prosperity are not equally available to all, and we can, instead, observe the rise of temporariness as a sign of these inequalities. The temporariness of life for workers in neoliberal networks of trade and governance can benefit some, while disenfranchising others, and the distribution of benefit is often divided along hemispheric, national, racial, and gendered lines. Such differences make themselves visible in the attendant multimedia texts that emerge alongside these developments.",Los Angeles,,
917,Biotechnical Ecologies: Urban Practice and Play in Buenos Aires and Los Angeles,"This dissertation forges a new critical rubric that explores synergies between urban ecologies, technologies, and cultural practices. It argues that contemporary regimes of control as well as forms of effective political intervention converge at the intersection of these fields. The critical framework it develops, biotechnical ecologies, is equipped to examine urban intervention through collective art practices and their speculative digital futures as well as contemporary forms of regulation and limitation at work in the urban landscape. Following an ethnographic methodology, the work is based on extensive research on organizations, artists and activists in Los Angeles and Buenos Aires. Complementing this empirical and site-based research, biotechnical ecologies also proposes alternative imaginings of these two cities and the works it explores within them while attending to their historical and material specificities. The urban media projects engaged include PigeonBlog, a participatory laymen science project designed by Beatriz da Costa that used carrier pigeons to monitor pollution in Southern California; BuenosAiresWord, an interactive web site that allows users to send and receive messages made of letters taken from images of text throughout the city; Buenos Aires Libre, a horizontally-organized group of programmers and computer enthusiasts who are building an autonomous network, apart from the internet, in Buenos Aires; and Machine Project, an arts and media collective and gallery space in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.",Los Angeles,,
989,Displaying Domesticity: Life in the Mid-Twentieth Century Glass House,"The mid-twentieth century glass and steel-framed house in Southern California challenged conventional ideas about domestic design and suggested dilemmas for modern domestic life. This study will analyze glass houses in Southern California---Los Angeles, Palm Springs, Ojai and Santa Barbara---built between 1945 and 1970 to better understand modernist space, the capabilities of building with steel and glass, and the ways in which home was defined at the mid-twentieth century. My historical study of architecture borrows methods from cognate fields of sociology, anthropology and women's studies to analyze exterior materials, structure, design, and spatial layout, the built landscape, domestic space, and the inhabitants who made the glass house into a home. The examples will be drawn from a study group of over one hundred glass houses designed and constructed in post-World War II Southern California from 1945--1970.",Los Angeles,Santa Barbara,
1094,Culture as urban renewal: Postwar los angeles and the remaking of public space,"Performing arts centers, museums, public parks, and wealthy socialites are not the typical subjects of postwar United States urban and policy histories. Yet, these subjects provide new opportunities to challenge our understanding of the processes that reshaped the nation's postwar urban landscape. This dissertation looks at cultural initiatives and spaces of leisure as a way to understand the larger social, economic, and political forces that shaped Los Angeles after World War II--specifically, the Hollywood Bowl, the L.A. Music Center, the L.A. County Museum of Art, and Elysian Park. The construction and revitalization of these public spaces offers new avenues for examining the role of urban planning and policy in remaking American cities in the postwar era. Each of these spaces would add to a modern urban identity being crafted by metropolitan leaders. On its own, each chapter tells a unique and captivating story of civic negotiation. Yet, these episodes collectively tell an even more important story about the broader postwar project to remake L.A., as each space was shaped by the same people, agencies, and policies within the short span of twenty-five years. Thus, my primary objective in this dissertation is to examine not only the significance of constructing cultural spaces in the project to remake L.A. into a national cultural epicenter, but also what that story reveals about postwar urban growth and urban renewal policy in Los Angeles. This dissertation invites readers to rethink the parameters of urban renewal by considering cultural and leisure spaces as a lens through which to understand the post-World War II project of city building. This research builds on the work of urban historians, cultural historians, and policy historians to frame a new set of questions about the ways in which cultural institution-building came to fruition through broader urban renewal initiatives. I argue that the construction and revival of cultural and leisure spaces in Los Angeles after World War II sparked the beginnings of a rapidly growing cultural infrastructure intended to displace New York as the nation's premier cultural metropolis. Further, civic leaders would increasingly rely on urban renewal policy to construct cultural spaces, and in the process come to discover that culture could function well as urban renewal. Yet, the success of these institutions was limited. This emerging concept of culture as urban renewal occurred within the context of a political realignment that saw an extended period of alliance between businessmen, county and city officials, and cultural philanthropists who came together to support pro-growth initiatives, many of which centered on downtown. By rethinking conventional narratives of urban renewal, this research shows how crucial leisure spaces were to remaking American cities after World War II.",Los Angeles,,
1103,Heat and B-10 enriched boric acid as recycled groundwater tracers for managed aquifer recharge,"California guidelines for recycled water reuse currently give preference to groundwater tracers to determine underground retention time, with a target retention time of >6 months from infiltration to drinking water extraction. Two prospective tracers were evaluated here: boron-10 (10B, the lesser abundant boron stable isotope), and heat (with recharging water warmed at sewage treatment plants and by solar radiation in surface-spreading basins). Bromide (Br-), a conservative deliberate salt tracer with limitations to low-volume settings, was released as a control. Tracer injection occurred when 3 kg of 10B-enriched boric acid and 36 kg of NaBr were added to the research test basin at San Gabriel Spreading Grounds, part of the Montebello Forebay, Los Angeles County, CA, USA. Recycled wastewater was piped directly to this basin at a rate of 2200 m3/day for ~two continuous months. 10B and Br- tracer breakthroughs were observed at seven monitoring wells ranging from directly beneath the basin floor to 150 m downgradient. Travel times ranged from 0.7 to 40 days. Arrival of Br- to each well was always coincident or preceded 10B arrival, reflecting retardation of 10B presumably due to exchange with clay surfaces. 10B/Br - travel time ratios determined from the center of mass ranged from 1 to 1.4. Travel times were successfully determined to all wells. Peak matching of diurnal variations was only possible at the nearest well (<1 day travel time). Basic analysis of temperature measurements, even in the absence of peak matching, yielded a reliable estimate of the underground residence time. Heat has great potential as an intrinsic tracer for managed recharge applications. Based on average tracer travel times, a vertical flow line directly below the test basin had an average vertical velocity of 3.3 m/day, equivalent to a recharge rate of 0.8 m/day.",Los Angeles,,
1115,Venimos a Triunfar! A Discourse Analysis of Spanish Language Radio Piolin por la Manana,"This master thesis offers a discourse analysis of Piolin por la Manana, a Spanish-language radio talk show, which broadcasts from Los Angeles, CA. Since its beginnings, U.S. Spanish-language radio has had a rich history of fostering safe platforms for the discussion of immigration matters, and of the needs of their immigrant-based audience. I study Piolin por la Manana as a contemporary case study of a radio show that holds a critical place in the lives of many Latino immigrants in terms of providing social, political, economic integration via diversified programming. In order to analyze the show's content, I take a close look at the persona of Eduardo 'Piolin' Sotelo, the show's long-standing host, and examine how he generates a discourse of unity, hope, and success through radio programming for a specific immigrant listenership. Using an interdisciplinary approach and an array of media objects that include 750 recorded hours of the show, news coverage, online videos, websites, blogs and magazines, I study the different semantic layers of the show to understand its significance for the immigrant-based audience. The analysis is further informed by the stories, opinions and experiences that thousands of Latino immigrants share daily on the air and which form an important component of the show's success. Throughout I explore how Piolin's direct involvement with popular and political discussions about immigration reform became key to the construction of the show's identity and of Piolin's profound influence within Latino communities. I argue that his involvement with immigration reform debates contributed adding credibility to him as a Latino community advocate. I also question the gains for the immigrant community stemming from multiple interactions between Piolin and President Barack Obama about immigration reform. Lastly, I review the meaning of show's signature slogan, Venimos a Triunfar [We've Come to Succeed], and how the immigrant-based audience embraces it. I argue that this slogan stirs notions of hope and embodies characteristics of the American dream. The phrase creates an identity for both the show and its immigrant-based audience and encourages employment, citizenship, consumerism, community and American ideals.",Los Angeles,,
1194,"Loving Luxury: The Cultural Economy of the Japanese American Home, 1920s","In the early 20th century, immigrant Japanese communities experienced heavy anti-immigrant sentiment through land laws, housing disenfranchisement, and exclusion. This dissertation examines how immigrant Japanese communities in Los Angeles cultivated respectable middle-class lifestyles in order to gain national inclusion. Utilizing Survey of Race Relations interviews, newspapers, papers of community organizations, and early 20th century social science research, this dissertation reveals how Japanese Americans responded to anti-immigrant sentiment by creating and building a material culture of American luxury in the home. Out of a growing consumer-driven market economy that greatly appealed to white middle-class standards of living, a new value system emerged within the Japanese American home. This dissertation introduces the new value system as a cultural economy, where practices around the home, individual manners, and family-oriented lifestyles became cultural measurements for national inclusion and exclusion as well as social prestige and hierarchy. Japanese Americans grew a profound commitment to middle-class respectability through newly gendered associations to labor as well as meaningful accumulation of economic success measurable in the stuff of homes.",Los Angeles,,
1225,Social Space of Los Angeles River Graffiti at the Meeting of Styles: L.A. (2007),"The Los Angeles River is a historical and prominent site for graffiti since the WPA channelized it for flood control purposes and encased its riverbanks in concrete during the 1930s. In September 2007 the Los Angeles hip-hop graffiti community organized a live graffiti mural painting event called Meeting of Styles: L.A. to exhibit the works of graffiti artists and to draw public attention to the neglected river. The event took place in the flood channel where the Arroyo Seco converges with the L.A. River. Local reporters and residents were invited to observe mural painting, while local youths took independent action to write on unpermitted areas of the channel. A few weeks after completion, municipal authorities demanded the removal of all murals and nearby tags. Officials refuted the organizer's original permits and argued that the works threatened the welfare and safety of local residents. The Meeting of Styles: LA event and controversy is a case study of graffiti's (re)production in the L.A. River, drawing out beliefs about the river's appearance and purpose. Drawing from Henri Lefebvre's theory of social space, I approach hip-hop graffiti as a contingent social process to focus on the relations between the constituents involved and to emancipate the notion of graffiti from strictly legal or art institutional definitions. Sources include a firsthand account of the live event, interviews, photographs, black book autographs, newspaper articles, videos, blog entries, and government transcripts which provide diverse perspectives of the varied forms of graffiti in the river. The thesis argues that the Meeting of Styles: L.A. event and controversy not only contextualized entrenched beliefs about graffiti and the L.A. River but it also proposed graffiti's agentive potential to expand the experiences and functions of the marginalized river. Socially, the event discerned a fuller range of constituents in graffiti's production. Spatially, it assembled a number of contradictions and agreements about graffiti practices and forms at a particular site. Politically, it revealed the Arroyo Seco to be a permeable space of power with varying methods and expressions of legitimacy.",Los Angeles,,
1312,We Have Been Silenced for Much Too Long: Music as Decolonial Resistance,"This dissertation examines La Contra Cultura (the Counter Culture), a musical movement centered in East Los Angeles which utilizes art as a cultural weapon. I use a theoretical framework that incorporates inequalities, social movements, and sociology of culture/popular culture, to do grounded, qualitative, analytic work focusing on oppositional consciousness, decolonization, and identity and community-building within the area of ethno-cultural music, art, and performance. Stemming from my fieldwork, I describe in detail the Contra Cultura, a mix of musicians, artists, vendors, organizers, and urban sacred sites, which examine native and indigenous history, challenge 500 years of colonization, and promotes an urban indigenous identity to challenge systems of racial oppression and white privilege. I then analyze the lyrics of over 400 songs to construct a decolonial pedagogy. The messages contained within the song lyrics address the legacies of colonization by building indigenous history, expressing a self conscious challenge to Eurocentric domination, and promotes the reclaiming of indigenous cultural thought to construct an urban indigenous identity. The dissertation then uses ethnographic data to understand live performance as ceremonies of resistance. At these urban ceremonies, musical performance is geared at creating autonomous communities by allowing participants to think critically about their lives while creating community history through a shared relationship to oppression. The concepts of Decolonial Imagination and Wombyn Warriors are then developed. Using case studies and in depth interviews, I explore the decolonial imagination through the work of Aztlan Underground and Olmeca. These two artists combine critical pedagogy and the Sociological Imagination to help their audiences understand their subjective realities within the objective conditions of capitalism and neo colonialism. The concept of the wombyn warrior is constructed by looking at the work of In Lak Ech, Cihuatl Ce, and the Guerrilla Queenz. These femc's use music as a tool to construct new visions of femininity, challenge colonized views of traditional womanhood, and promote cultural affirmation through the birthing of art, poetry, music, and teatro.",Los Angeles,,
1343,"Violent, Criminal, Illegal Immigrants: MS-13---The Discursive Misrepresentation of a Global Gang","This thesis examines Los Angeles Times and La Opinion's portrayal of global gang Mara Salvatrucha from 1990 to 2006 (Los Angeles Times) and from 1992 to 2006 ( La Opinion). Through the use of critical content and discourse analysis, this thesis yields numerical and discursive data that strongly suggests that Los Angeles Times and La Opinion misrepresent Mara Salvatrucha as a Central American gang of ""Violent, Criminal, Illegal Immigrants."" Los Angeles Times and La Opinion's misrepresentation of Mara Salvatrucha, a Latino subgroup, represents a change of discourse on Latinos in United States corporate news channels. This particular discourse uncovered is anchored primarily by themes of criminality, illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and violence. The potential policy ramifications influenced in part by corporate news channels and the negative social perceptions they portray, are likely to play out in harsh anti-immigrant, anti-gang, and anti-drug trafficking legislation that would pose a serious risk to the quality of life and democratic safeguards against civil rights and liberties abuses of Latinos in the United States.",Los Angeles,,
1380,"In the Wake of Crisis: Race, Place and Residential Foreclosures in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Region","At least 2.8 million households faced foreclosure in 2009, and this record-breaking rate held steady in 2010. Concentrated foreclosures are associated with a host of negative consequences, including increased vacancies, higher crime rates, decreased property values and tax revenue, and deteriorated neighborhood quality (Immergluck and Smith 2006a; Immergluck and Smith 2006b; Apgar and Calder 2005). But it is well known that foreclosures are unequally distributed across neighborhoods, and it seems likely that the consequences of foreclosure vary as well. This dissertation offers a detailed mapping of foreclosure rates and their consequences in one large and diverse geographic region, namely the Los Angeles (LA) metropolitan area. Past research has identified location (urban, suburban, exurban) and racial and class composition as highly salient dimensions of neighborhood stratification. The present project focuses on effects of ""class, race and place"" and their interactions in determining the prevalence and consequences of foreclosures in diverse LA neighborhoods. I ask three guiding questions: (1) What are the characteristics of neighborhoods in the LA area that experienced the highest rates of foreclosure? (2) What neighborhood characteristics influence the current status of previously foreclosed properties (e.g., whether they sell or remain vacant)? (3) Who buys foreclosed properties in different types of neighborhoods, and how might this alter neighborhood demographics? Using a unique data set that merges foreclosure, home sales, home loan, and census data for the 3,346 census tracts in the Los Angeles consolidated metropolitan statistical area for the period January 2008--December 2009, I examine whether previous patterns of neighborhood inequality in LA have been reinforced or altered by the foreclosure crisis. This research helps to identify the uneven impact of the foreclosure crisis across neighborhoods and provides an opportunity to examine the interactions of class, race and place in determining the prevalence and consequences of foreclosure.",Los Angeles,,
1652,Where's the Gig at? The East Los Angeles Backyard Punk Scene and the Creations of Social Spaces at the Turn of the 21st Century,"In this thesis I document, describe and analyze the reconfigurations of space in East Los Angeles with punk rock cultures, particularly the backyard punk scene from 1998-2008. In the processes of reconfiguration privately oriented and policed places are transformed into public oriented punk rock social spaces. With a focus on punk rock culture that includes music, gig organization and travel to gigs I look into the creation of multiple forms of social space where aggrieved persons can construct uplifting identities and form new subjectivities and solidarities with others. Through an ethnographic methodology I reveal how the social spatial and cultural production of gigs creates new discursive and physical sites of congregation and mutual aid. Interviews with participants of the backyard scene reveal that by attending to their needs, desires and imaginations they actively take part in a continuing practice of social protest in East Los Angeles. Accompanying the Skums on their travels to and from backyard gigs I reveal that in East Los Angeles punk rock is not only about music, but also about constructing methods of reaching and returning from backyard gigs. The spatial relations I witnessed reveal that Chicanas/os and Latinas/os face unfair consequences like other impoverished classes whose presence in the public sphere brings with it suspicion and criminalization. The stakes of the unpaid labors that make up punk rock in East Los Angeles are complex. East Los Angeles cultural actors work diligently to materialize a range of desires that in effect offset the lack of city and state funded public spaces in their neighborhoods and make segregation into congregation with use value orientations to space and cultures of punk rock.",Los Angeles,,
1214,"Wine, Meaning, and Place: Terroir-Tourism, Concealed Workers, and Contested Space in the Napa Valley","California provides a unique opportunity to investigate how capitalist agriculture shapes the development of different societies. The types of agricultural workers and communities that can or are found in association with agricultural crops in California vary according to historical specificity, location and commodity produced. Production and consumption are closely linked. This linkage between consumption and production is evident in the rapid increase in the production of wine grapes across California as the consumption of wine increases globally. In the Napa Valley, the capital investment in the wine industry is changing the organization of wine grape agriculture and its relationship to labor. I investigate the role of terroir-tourism by examining the interconnection of various sectors of labor: vineyard labor, wine production, and tasting rooms. I argue that wine grape cultivation is a significant factor in shaping both physical and social spaces, society, people and landscapes in the Napa Valley. This dissertation argues that the intensified production (more labor intensive) in premium wine grapes is facilitating the permanent settlement of Mexican farm laborers in the Napa Valley. Through the use of ethnographic accounts this dissertation interrogates the meaning of social interaction in specific spaces between Mexican farm laborers and white actors. This dissertation is theoretically driven by space and examines how power, language, class, race, and knowledge interact in a social setting where the parameters are tightly scripted. An analysis of how space is controlled, relinquished, and contested reveals tangible social and cultural impacts of the wine industry on immigrant farmworkers and local communities.",Napa,,
1558,The Place of the Sublime in American Art from Thomas Cole to Robert Smithson,"In the history of American art is there something identifiable as the sublime? If so, is it based solely on received ideas, from Longinus through Edmund Burke and Immanuel Kant, and referential only to landscape representation? The dissertation argues otherwise and looks at work by Thomas Cole, Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still and Robert Smithson. It addresses the issue through the thought of Kant, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Edward Casey and Lyotard and on twentieth-century writings in art criticism and art history that bear on these artists and their relation to the sublime. My thesis is that until quite recently the sublime was understood in a conventional way and the related work of these artists was seen through that tradition. Since the late 1970s, however, the sublime has been rethought as a tension between presentation and representation and, as such, it takes place in or at the artwork. In key pieces by these painters and sculptor this post-aesthetic understanding can be seen as an American contribution to the history of art and the sublime.",Newman,,
590,"Oscar Grant 'Moment': The Principal Contradiction of Racial Capitalism, Extrajudicial Police Murders, and Popular Self-Activity","As a result of the Oscar Grant 'moment', popular social bodies made significant gains - by disrupting networks of elites who were advancing gentrification and policing, as well as breaking the veritable impunity to law enforcement officers who murder extra-judiciously. More importantly, and as activist accounts and analyses state, popular social bodies deepened their analyses of law enforcement and the 'non-profit industrial complex', as well as deepened their networks and ties, all of which allowed for the intensity and maturation of struggle manifest in the Occupy Oakland 'moment'. While gains were made through the synergistic condensation of popular self-activity from different networks of people, we are still left wanting by way of re-/producing a radically democratic social order, and the synergy of popular self-activity necessary to do so cannot be left to happenstance. As such, open-ended questions about making radical political praxis mundane in 'ordinary' times are proposed. Rather than bring people to extraordinary acts of radical political praxis in moments of crisis, how do we weave radical political praxis into the mundane and the practical of 'ordinary' times? How do we produce radically democratic, popular vehicles to resolve pressing, popular issues and realize collective utopian visions? This dissertation demonstrates racial capitalism as the principal contradiction that negates human dignity and life by reviewing the development of racial capitalism in Oakland, the contemporary forms of premature death it produces, as well as naming some of the contemporary projects and agents that are profitably repressing and antagonizing popular social bodies through gentrification and saturation policing. Furthermore, using grassroots and independent media as an archive, this dissertation examines the popular self-activity that condensed into and produced the Oscar Grant ""moment"". This demonstrates the robust condensation of popular self-activity from a multitude of different groups and traditions - from radical political traditions of anarchism and marxism, to those active in the cultural production of hip hop -- as well how people from seemingly apolitical networks and active in seemingly apolitical pursuits contributed to this moment of intensified struggle. There are a number of limitations when the Oscar Grant 'moment' is mentioned, documented, or analyzed in academic literature. The extrajudicial police murder of Oscar Grant is reductively credited to a static, transhistoric racism, and the popular self-activity that made Grant's murder known are erased or under-analyzed. This, perhaps, is because academics appear to have not engaged the texts produced by radical activist-scholars, texts that contain the most accurate historical accounts and erudite analyses of this moment. While there is consistency to white supremacy and the premature death it produces, such a reductive portrayal obscures the historically and geographic specific projects and networks of social bodies that are re-/articulating racial regimes particular to specific times and places -- leaving sites for popular intervention unnamed. In performing the necessary work of demonstrating the forces of racial capitalism and its bloody consequences, we might lose sight of popular self-activity, the means of producing a radically democratic social order. The Oscar Grant 'moment' was a period of intensified struggle in Oakland - starting just before Oscar Grant, a young Black man, was murdered by transit police officer Johannes Mehserle on January 1st, 2009, and lasting (at least) until November 5th, 2010 (when Johannes Mehserle was sentenced for involuntary manslaughter). Despite local news coverage, and subsequent popular cultural texts, few academic texts engage the Oscar Grant ""moment"", a moment rich for analysis as a number of social issues can be refracted and studied -- from resistance, to the expansion and militarization of policing, to gentrification, neoliberal multiculturalism in urban planning, gentrification, the 'non-profit industrial complex', to the repression of social struggles.",Oakland,,
972,The Private Side of Public Space: How Black Women Manage Interactions in Inner City Communities,"This dissertation examines how Black women and girls navigate distressed urban neighborhoods. Nearly two years of field research among adolescents and adults in the Central East neighborhood of Oakland, California provides an ethnographic account of how young Black women accomplish the routine tasks necessary for basic survival in poor inner city neighborhoods and how the intersections of race, gender, and class shape how Black women and girls interact with others in public. Previous research has examined the experiences of African American men and boys living in disadvantaged communities, whereas my research pays special attention to the experiences of African American women and girls. In particular, few scholars have explored the collective experiences of young women living in the inner city and the innovative strategies they develop to navigate daily life in this setting. My analysis uncovers forms of gender-specific violence, particular kinds of troubled public encounters, as well as the different types of physical and emotional work young women do to negotiate the demands of living in underserved communities regularly exposed to violence. My original analysis of routine public interactions illustrates the lived experiences of poor African American women and girls and the creative strategies they develop to manage these troubling, everyday experiences and survive in this space each day.",Oakland,,
902,"The Role of Political Empowerment in Challenging Environmental Injustice: A Case Study in Oxnard, California","This study aims to examine the role of political empowerment in mitigating environmental injustice and seeks to identify how civic engagement can be promoted in immigrant communities. There is overwhelming literature supporting the theory that low levels of civic capacity and public participation in marginalized communities is a main catalyst in the creation of environmental injustice. Some of the obstacles to civic engagement that immigrants face include language barriers, mistrust, fear of retribution or deportation and lack of awareness, resources and time. Overcoming these barriers and encouraging political participation is vital to promoting environmental justice and is the foundation of this study. My field research examines the perceptions of environmental risk and the civic capacity of the low-income, immigrant community in Oxnard, CA. In this case, environmental injustice can be seen in the disproportionate exposure of the residents of Oxnard to pesticides used by large agricultural businesses. The methods utilized in my field research include qualitative survey research, ethnographic site visits and media content analysis. Concluding recommendations aim to address the current regulatory framework, enhance affected communities' legal capacity, and improve Spanish radio's potential as an avenue to promote awareness and public dialogue.",Oxnard,,
202,Over the Line : Critical Media Technologies of the Trans-American Hyperborder,"My project argues that the U.S.-Mexico border is an assemblage of medial forms that are communicated in multiple media without superseding one another. For example, the border is, at once, a graphic design on numerous maps; a symbolic construction in copious literary and legal textual media; a series of fences erected in various terrestrial media; a photographic icon in still and moving pictures; an architectural design; a painted figure; the list goes on. As an assortment of medial forms, The U.S.-Mexico border does not refer to the United States and Mexico as the subjects of its mediation, but rather produces the United States and Mexico as subjects, which thereon depend on the border for their subjectivity, as the border depends on the nations for its continued existence. The United States and Mexico cannot be articulated from or with one another without what media theorist Bernhard Siegert calls ""concrete practices and symbolic operations"" to process their articulation, operations which are ultimately expressed in medial forms, whether lines on maps, untranslatable proper nouns, legal writ, poetic verses, or fences. In drawing connections between the borders produced in different media, I am examining borders as media systems that correspond to different cultural techniques and produce distinct political subjectivities. To envision this network, I develop the concept of the hyperborder, which I define as a border that extends across media. The hyperborder is a framework that links together different mediated borders, and that proposes and examines epistemological connections between them. The hyperborder is a way of attaining a global and comparative view of borders, while at the same time accounting for their different and irreducible media forms. In this project, I examine border forms primarily in three media: literary media, including poetry and prose; cartographic media, with an attention to different cultural meanings of mapmaking; and infrastructural media, particularly types of fencing. My methodology for researching and comparing these different media forms combines archival and participatory research. In order to study textual borders---those found in literary and cartographic media---I have relied on archival research carried out at UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library and in the Special Collections of UCSB's Davidson Library. My desire to account for the location of media has also compelled me to research media forms in the field, so to speak. My analysis of Indigenous mapping in Chapter Two is informed by conversations that I have had with Jim Enote, director of the A:shiwi A:wan Museum and Heritage Center at Zuni Pueblo. My analysis of the U.S.-Mexico border fence in Chapter Three is grounded in physical fieldwork at the site of the fence, particularly with Friends of Friendship Park in San Diego and Tijuana. My combination of archival and participatory research practices allows for a wider view of the border. It also situates my project in numerous academic disciplines and fields, including Comparative Literature, Media Studies, Border Studies, History, Chicana/o Studies, and Indigenous Studies. In developing the comparative framework of the hyperborder, I am making use of the interdisciplinary potential of Comparative Literature, albeit in a way that problematizes the discipline by including what may not be considered ""literary"" in my comparisons. Although originating in Comparative Literature, my methodology has wandered, through the discipline's encyclopedic opening, into Media Studies, where I can compare objects like those listed above through concepts like cultural techniques and knowledge systems. I am mainly applying my Media Studies and Comparative Literature approach in order to intervene in the interdisciplinary field of Border Studies. As an academic specialization, Border Studies leans toward political and social sciences, and often leads to bureaucratic professionalization. My project complements and challenges a social sciences-oriented Border Studies with a humanities-based approach that insists on the media specificity of borders. Similarly, my project is engaged with rethinking the paradigmatic borderlands, as conceptualized by historian Herbert Eugene Bolton in the early 20th century. While my dissertation is grounded in borderlands historiography, my sense of History is directed toward a borderlands of media---toward medial differences, and how they determine boundaries in the symbolic and in the real. A major assertion in my project is that cultural differences correlate to media operations. I thus pay critical attention to the disciplinary frameworks of Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies, and to how their disciplinary stances and social frameworks are articulated with those of History and Border Studies. While older center-periphery historiographies relegated Chicana/o cultural production to regional margins, my project marks how Chicana/o texts address these problematics in media-specific ways.

961,"Hidden Channels: Indians, Franciscans, Soldiers, and Resistance in California History (1769--1829)","My dissertation traced patterns of rebellion by the indigenous peoples of California from 1775 to 1828. Focusing on uprisings within the mission communities of San Diego, San Gabriel, Santa Barbara, La Purisima, Santa Ines, and San Jose, I integrated data from several disciplines and sources---including contemporary and historic ethnography, linguistic research, archival research, and folklore---to build a picture of the rebellions and the motivations behind them. What made my work unique was its focus on unpacking the rhetoric used by both the missionaries and the military officers whose reports constitute the main sources of our knowledge about these rebellions. Violence periodically engulfed the California frontier, but the Spanish and later Mexican authorities that responded to these uprisings were often in competition with one another. Their accounts present vastly different views of these events, and often blamed individuals in the other camp for provoking these events.",San Diego,San Jose,Santa Barbara
1071,Remote-sensing based characterization of herbaceous vegetation in california shrublands,"Southern California shrublands are threatened by nonnative European annual grasses, which contribute to substantial fragmentation and loss of these ecologically important communities. Both natural and anthropogenic disturbances provide opportunities for competitive exotic herbaceous species to colonize in gaps in shrublands and overtake native grasses and shrubs. Remote sensing using moderate resolution imagery can provide a spatially comprehensive, cost-effective, and repeatable approach to monitor the establishment and expansion of nonnative herbaceous cover into sensitive habitats, and provide the potential for detecting native herbaceous cover where it occurs in high fractions. The underlying goal of this study is to better understand the temporal, spectral, and spatial characteristics of herbaceous vegetation in California shrublands in the context of effectively mapping and monitoring herbaceous vegetation cover using remote sensing methods. Chapter 2 provides the details of the phenological response and spectral properties of native and nonnative herbaceous cover, based on plot-based fieldwork conducted in CSS habitat in the San Diego National Wildlife Refuge (SDNWR). High temporal resolution field spectroscopic data were shown to be useful for determining when native and nonnative herbaceous vegetation in CSS are most spectrally separable in the course of a growing season. In Chapter 3, intraannual remote sensing methods are explored to map herbaceous cover fraction in shrublands. Optimal discernment of herbaceous cover was found using single-date imagery timed in the early summer months (early June in 2010); fractional cover of growth forms was mapped with errors of 0.08 or less. Chapter 4 investigates the stability and reliability of cover fractions modeled using a multitemporal remote sensing approach. MESMA applied to three dates (2008, 2010, and 2011) of SPOT imagery was used successfully to model growth form fractions over a large extent of shrubland vegetation with low individual and overall error. Findings from this study indicate that MESMA applied to moderate resolution imagery timed to maximize spectral differences between growth forms is an effective approach for quantifying changes in fractional cover that exceeds ten percent, providing a way to delineate and quantify herbaceous invasions and expansions following disturbance or succession.",San Diego,,
1140,Statistics for Time-Series Spatial Data: Applying Survival Analysis to Study Land-Use Change,"Traditional spatial analysis and data mining methods fall short of extracting temporal information from data. This inability makes their use difficult to study changes and the associated mechanisms of many geographic phenomena of interest, for example, land-use. On the other hand, the growing availability of land-change data over multiple time intervals and longer time frames, often based on satellite imagery, presents to land-change study a great opportunity, given that this information can be effectively utilized. This methodological gap highlights the need to better understand the analytical challenges brought by temporal complexities, and to investigate alternative analytical frameworks that could handle those challenges. This dissertation attempted to achieve three goals: 1) finding metrics to capture temporal trends, 2) dealing with temporally imprecise data due to constraints of frequency, duration, and starting time of data collection, and 3) handling variables with time-changing values. A simulated land-change dataset based on an agent-based model of residential development and an empirical dataset from two case study sites in San Diego and Tijuana were used for this investigation. Results from the simulation dataset indicated that the survival function and the hazard function are important metrics to reveal temporal trends. In general the results of land-change analysis are sensitive to time frequency, in particular when time-dependent variables are also present. Longer duration benefits land-change analysis since longer durations contains more information. However, time-dependent variables with measures over a long period are more difficult for detection, which may pose a challenge. Starting time also affects the analytical results because the level of process uncertainty varies at different starting times. Findings from real world data mostly agree with those from computational data. Time dependent variables present a major challenge in land-change analysis, and survival analysis can better handle time-independent variables and thus better forecast urban growth.",San Diego,,
1274,Time-sensitive Remote Sensing,"This dissertation explores the readiness of remote sensing science, in terms of methodological prescription and theory, to address time-sensitive information requirements. It synthesizes and evaluates predominant conceptualizations of remote sensing and critically evaluates them in terms of their ability to inform the design of remote sensing systems to address time-sensitive information requirements, presents a novel conceptual model of remote sensing based in information theory, and demonstrates the evaluation and updating of a remote sensing system to meet the time-sensitive information requirements of wildfire managers in California. In chapter 2, current conceptualizations of remote sensing are found lacking in their ability to inform the optimization of remote sensing systems for application to time-sensitive phenomena because they omit several factors affecting the timeliness of information delivery. Characteristics of a conceptual remote sensing model appropriate for time-sensitive remote sensing are identified; such a model should: (1) conceptualize the collection of technologies used to acquire, process, and distribute remote sensing information as a single system that can be optimized; (2) acknowledge that remote sensing exists to inform decisions; (3) recognize that the decision maker (i.e., user) and information are both fundamental to the effectiveness of such decisions; and (4) account for tradeoffs between the type, reliability, and timeless of information produced by remote sensing systems. The Fields of Operations Research, Decision Science, and Systems Theory are highlighted as likely sources for methods and theory on the optimization of remote sensing systems to meet the needs of specific users and user groups. Chapter 3 presents a conceptual model of remote sensing as a communication system for the transmission of information; the remote sensing communication model. The mathematical model of communication from engineering, broader philosophical perspectives on the nature of information and communication, and the map communication model are used to conceptualize remote sensing a communication system, explain the production, communication, and ingestion of remote sensing information, and to estimate the timeliness of information delivery by remote sensing systems. The remote sensing communication model places remote sensing within a decision support context, where the effectiveness of a decision and the subsequent value of an information product is dependent upon both the qualities of the information (e.g., timeliness, accuracy) and the nature of the decision process (e.g., user bias, technical expertise, cartographic proficiency). The conceptualization of remote sensing as a communication system permits the estimation of sensor, channel, and receiver capacity. Methods for the estimation of sensor, channel, and receiver capacity are outlined, but further research into the reliable estimation of both human and automated receivers is warranted. Chapter 4 applies the Remote Sensing Communication Model (RSCM) to improve a tactical wildfire remote sensing system to better meet the time sensitive information requirements of emergency response managers in San Diego County, USA. A thermal infrared airborne remote sensing system designed and operated by the United States Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station for active wildfire monitoring is documented and updated based on the RCSM. Analysis of the thermal infrared remote sensing system in the context of the RSCM identified three configuration changes that can improve the effectiveness of the information produced when employed by wildfire incident commanders for suppression prioritization: (1) limit spectral sampling collection to a single waveband; (2) complete image processing steps onboard; and (3) provide information on wildfire locations to incident commanders in the form of a static map. Collectively, this research evaluates current theoretical and methodological approaches to the design of RSSs using a structured approach and proposes a novel conceptual model of remote sensing grounded in geographic and information theory. It explores and highlights the issues and challenges presented by the use of remote sensing to fulfill time-sensitive information requirements, defines a common vocabulary for their discussion, and provides methods for the systematic evaluation and design of RSSs to address time-sensitive information requirements. Going forward, it would seem that the fields of Operations Research, Decisions Science, Systems Theory, and Software Engineering could make significant contributions toward the development of both theoretical and practical approaches to the design of remote sensing systems to address time-sensitive information requirements. The limited operational use of remote sensing to address time-sensitive information requirements and collective finding of this dissertation suggest that the development of RSSs for specific time-sensitive applications (e.g., wildfire response, earthquake response, oil spill response) and response areas, such that those preconfigured RSSs can be activated during an appropriate event and provide appropriate information products that are easily employed by decisions makers, is likely the only way to ensure the effective use remote sensing in a hazard response context, and likely time-sensitive applications in general.

1437,Developing High Performance GIS Simulation Models on Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure: A Case Study of Population Change Models with Grid Computing and Cloud Computing Technologies,"Many geography phenomena and geospatial problems are complex and dynamic. Traditional Geographic Information System (GIS) models have limitations to represent the detailed dynamic processes of geospatial phenomena in the real world. This dissertation introduces a new GIS model framework which can simulate complex population change by using large amounts of real-world data sets and high performance computing resources. This research developed parallel GIS simulation models using cellular automata (CA) and agent-based modeling (ABM) that have been very popular in urban geography. The case study of the parallel GIS simulation models in this dissertation focused on the population change in the County of San Diego, California. In particular, for the parallel ABM, this research modified the original Schelling model, a popular residential segregation model, to process over 2.8 million resident agents. With the high performance computing capability, the GIS models could simulate the dynamics of population change efficiently and help us understand the formation of residential segregation in the future. In addition, the case study demonstrated performance improvement, technical feasibility, and implementation challenges of the parallelization of GIS simulation models in CA and ABM. While high-performance computing is essential for many scientific research disciplines and the domain of computational science, very few geospatial scientists have utilized high-performance computing for the analysis of geographic problems. One of the important reasons is the lack of accessible high-performance computing resources. A new user-friendly web portal framework was designed and implemented to integrate distributed computing resources and to provide high-performance computing capabilities for GIS models. Grid computing and cloud computing resources were integrated into the web portal framework with accessible web-based user interfaces. Usability test was conducted at the end of this study to evaluate the accessibility and functions of the new web portal prototype in high-performance computing environments. The test results indicated that many users did not prefer the detailed configurations of high-performance computing resources. This study suggested that the detailed settings of high-performance computing environments should be concealed in the web-based user interface designed for scientists or geographers, who could focus more on geographic problems.",San Diego,,
1513,An analysis of tree mortality using high resolution remotely-sensed data for mixed-conifer forests in San Diego county,"ABSTRACT An Analysis of Tree Mortality Using High Resolution Remotely--Sensed Data for Mixed--Conifer Forests in San Diego County by Mary Pyott Freeman The montane mixed--conifer forests of San Diego County are currently experiencing extensive tree mortality, which is defined as dieback where whole stands are affected. This mortality is likely the result of the complex interaction of many variables, such as altered fire regimes, climatic conditions such as drought, as well as forest pathogens and past management strategies. Conifer tree mortality and its spatial pattern and change over time were examined in three components. In component 1, two remote sensing approaches were compared for their effectiveness in delineating dead trees, a spatial contextual approach and an OBIA (object based image analysis) approach, utilizing various dates and spatial resolutions of airborne image data. For each approach transforms and masking techniques were explored, which were found to improve classifications, and an object-based assessment approach was tested. In component 2, dead tree maps produced by the most effective techniques derived from component 1 were utilized for point pattern and vector analyses to further understand spatio-temporal changes in tree mortality for the years 1997, 2000, 2002, and 2005 for three study areas: Palomar, Volcan and Laguna mountains. Plot--based fieldwork was conducted to further assess mortality patterns. Results indicate that conifer mortality was significantly clustered, increased substantially between 2002 and 2005, and was non--random with respect to tree species and diameter class sizes. In component 3, multiple environmental variables were used in Generalized Linear Model (GLM--logistic regression) and decision tree classifier model development, revealing the importance of climate and topographic factors such as precipitation and elevation, in being able to predict areas of high risk for tree mortality. The results from this study highlight the importance of multi--scale spatial as well as temporal analyses, in order to understand mixed--conifer forest structure, dynamics, and processes of decline, which can lead to more sustainable management of forests with continued natural and anthropogenic disturbance.",San Diego,,
1595,The Geographic Dimensions of Day Labor Conflict in the San Diego Metropolitan Area,"This dissertation focuses on the spatial organization and operation of immigrant day-labor markets, as well as the socio-spatial relationships between hiring sites and their surrounding neighborhoods that sometimes generate serious community conflicts. The primary purpose of this research is to reduce or eliminate day-labor conflicts at the local level through improved urban planning, community building and education, and improved communication networks among laborers. The geographic perspective is critical for this analysis, as planning for day labor activities requires understanding how the markets work at multiple spatial scales. This dissertation project uses geographic information systems (GIS) and quantitative analysis in combination with qualitative research methods to explore the geography of day labor markets in the San Diego Metropolitan Area. Specifically, it examines the distribution and locational characteristics of day labor hiring sites and the neighborhoods that support them. Each day in the SDMA, approximately 1000 men look for work at one of the forty-five total day labor hiring sites located within the region. There is considerable diversity within the day-labor population; some hiring sites are used almost entirely by recent migrants to the area, while others are used by long-time residents of a variety of backgrounds. The diversity of day laborers increased as a result of the economic downturn that began in 2006; the lingering effects of which are still visible at the time of publication in 2012. Laborers across the region employ a locational strategy termed ""strategic visibility"" in their selection of hiring site locations, as well as their organization within day-labor spaces. Strategic visibility maximizes employment opportunities and accessibility to employers, while avoiding undesired attention and/or visibility. The fact that day labor hiring sites are located in neighborhoods where employment opportunities are greatest - those with high levels of employment in construction and agriculture, as well as higher than average numbers of owner-occupied homes - is evidence of this strategy at the regional scale. This regional and neighborhood-level analysis is combined with street-level observation and ethnography to understand the ways that spaces of work and social reproduction are informally constructed, maintained, and altered by day laborers and other community members. The processes that generate day labor conflicts are particularly important for this study, and the analysis in this dissertation finds that so-called day labor conflicts often arise due to local crises that are unrelated to day-labor activities. Furthermore, the actions taken by local governments and community groups to try and control day labor activities are costly and largely ineffective. This dissertation demonstrates the importance of everyday urban rhythms on day labor activities and the ways that negotiations for control of space connect laborers and local stakeholders to each other and to particular hiring sites. Only by acknowledging these relationships and processes that connect laborers to particular spaces and incorporating them into day-labor support efforts, can local government and community groups implement policies that protect laborers and ensures that day-labor activities do not inhibit other community members from using urban spaces in the most productive manner as well.",San Diego,,
210,Ask Him If You're Being Detained : Bystander resistance in street police encounters,"Recent uprisings in Baltimore, Maryland and Ferguson, Missouri have revealed a crisis of legitimacy for police in poor communities of color. This project considers the crisis of legitimacy for police at the street level. Data come in the form of third party videos collected by a local resident of the Fillmore, a poor black neighborhood subject to aggressive policing located in San Francisco, CA. Videos capture police-citizen interactions and analysis focused on bystander participation during the street encounter. Videos were analyzed using methods of analytic induction and visual coding schemes. Findings show that bystanders use taunting and insulting the police as a form of resistance. Additionally, bystanders give advice to the subject of the encounter. Furthermore, bystander comments reveal the ways they believe gender and race to be relevant to the police-citizen encounter and relationship with law enforcement more generally. Bystander talk reframes the encounter and positions the subject as victim and law enforcement as the source of trouble. Bystanders accuse the police of going beyond the parameters of their jobs to express sexual desire and racial antipathy. Additionally, bystander participation dramatizes the limits of police authority as bystanders offer the subject legal advice and creates derogatory experiences for the police.",San Francisco,Fillmore,
596,"Correlating Biological Relationships, Social Inequality, and Population Movement among Prehistoric California Foragers: Ancient Human DNA Analysis from CA-SCL-38 (Yukisma Site)","Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data was collected from 200 individuals from CA-SCL-38 (Yukisma Mound), hereafter referred to as SCL-38 as well as 102 additional burials from 15 other archaeological sites in the region to test for a relationship between direct maternal kinship (i.e., genetic relatedness as revealed by mtDNA), grave goods, and burial patterns. This was ultimately done to determine whether spatial patterns at SCL-38 are associated with the emergence/maintenance of social differentiation and inferred social inequality. These data were additionally used at the inter-site level to explore the hypothesized spread of Penutian populations and to document genetic continuity in the San Francisco Bay area through time. Reconstruction of regional North American prehistory has benefited from the incorporation of ancient DNA evidence. However, few studies focus on intra-site genetic variation, associate these relationships to mortuary assemblages, or link these variables to social ranking. The Late Period (900 BP-250 BP) in the San Francisco Bay area witnessed shifts in settlement patterns that included mortuary treatment distinct from earlier periods. The change in mortuary pattern is interpreted either as a reduction in social inequality, a shift toward corporate group identity based on kinship, or an emergence of a lesser number of differentiated elites with control over high status resources. Results indicate that maternal relatedness is not correlated to the spatial distribution of burials within the cemetery. Additionally, no associations are noted between particular mtDNA haplotypes and burials with high quantity or diversity of grave goods. Thus, the overall placement of burials at SCL-38 are random with respect to direct maternal relationships. However, regardless of mortuary assembleges, there are some subgroupings within the cemetery of individuals related at the maternal level. The heterogenous distribution of mtDNA lineages across the spatial extent of the site may instead reflect its use as a regional cemetery for select, perhaps wealthy elite, individuals who originated from the surrounding Bay area. It remains possible that patterning along the paternal line or the lack of temporal refinement is confounding other underlying genetic structure. Across the landscape, however, mtDNA lineages are identified that correspond with the hypothesized influx of Proto-Utian (Penutian) speakers into the San Francisco Bay area by the end of the Early Period and beginning of the Middle Period. Additonal haplotypes are also identified that are probably older than 7,000 BP in the region, most likely representing maternal lineages orignally belonging to ancestral Hokan speakers. Most mtDNA haplotypes discussed represent at least 2,000 years of genetic continuity in the region.",San Francisco,,
1021,A Realization of 'Acting Locally and Thinking Globally': A New Framework for Incorporating International Treaties in the United States,"Since WWII, the human rights movement has both evolved and expanded, but it has remained focused on belief that ""all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights,"" as exemplified in Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet, despite the importance of these rights, the United States is party to only 12 of the 27 articles that have been identified as ""most central to the spirit and goals of the Charter,"" every one of them subject to conditions. It is for this reason that this paper examines the barriers to the ratification of human rights law in the United States and seeks to address the question: can the local incorporation of human rights law at the city or state level offer an alternative to its failure to be ratified at the federal level? In order to answer this question, the existing literature on human rights and American exceptionalism will be analyzed in the context of the diffusion of global norms to the local level to better understand how the San Francisco Convention for the Elmination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) ordinance provides us with an example of both government and civil society actors working together to initiate international law in the United States, as well as an example of a participatory problem-solving approach being used in place of the traditional top-down methods. From such a study this thesis concludes that not only is CEDAW necessary for women in the United States to experience a greater realization of their rights, but also finds that implementing CEDAW at the local or sub-national level can offer communities the opportunity to extend rights to their citizens that the national government has thus far failed to ensure. The greatest challenge will be making this alternative available in regions of the United States that may not be prepared to grant true gender equality.",San Francisco,,
1150,Incited to rhyme: Lesbian rappers in bay area's hip hop underground,"There is not much room within mainstream Hip Hop for women to claim space as cultural agents. The relative dearth of female emcees present to balance the gender perspectives within mainstream Hip Hop and no queer (or even openly queer friendly) voices in mainstream Hip Hop, leads to important questions for scholars to consider: In a musical culture that is seen as male dominated and somewhat hostile to the LGTBIQ community, how do queer women carve out a space that is solely their own? How do they do this in a realm in which they have double marginality? This research shifts the popular focus away from the pitfalls of mainstream Hip Hop and instead draws our attention to the way that Hip Hop is lived and practiced at the local and interactional level. This paper draws from ethnographic fieldwork, lyrical analysis and in depth interviews with lesbian Hip Hop artists from the San Francisco Bay Area in order to analyze the ways that queer women contribute to the broader landscape of the Bay Area underground Hip Hop scene. Specifically, this project explores how Queer women of color within the Hip Hop generation navigate a Bay Area music scene and a broader global underground of queer Hip Hop artists. In contrast to literature that highlights women's invisibility in Hip Hop, this paper describes how queer women work to make themselves visible within Hip Hop culture.",San Francisco,,
1349,Reduced Parasitism in a Highly Invaded Estuary: San Francisco Bay,"It is paradoxical that San Francisco Bay (SFB), the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Americas and an iconic ecosystem for biological invasions, is understudied regarding quantitative data on free-living species, and virtually unexamined regarding their parasites. I incorporate archaeological records, historical, and recent data to reconstruct the Bay's intertidal macroinvertebrate and shallow water fish assemblage circa 1850 AD to reveal a general shift in fauna from marine native to euryhaline exotic intertidal invertebrates. My findings suggest that the combination of biotic and abiotic forcing events impacted native species, especially mollusks and, with a time lag, resulted in the extirpation of many native species. My assessment of the distribution and abundance of the native and exotic intertidal and shallow water fauna of SFB finds that the ratio of exotic to native species varies among habitat assemblages, Bay regions, and taxa. The majority of motile species are native, whereas the majority of sedentary/sessile species are exotic, and the densities of some native taxa are so low that they are at risk of extirpation. Finally, I examine the Enemy Release Hypothesis in relation to metazoan parasitism and biological invasions. Community studies compare species richness, prevalence, and intensity of parasitism in similar natives and exotics within SFB. Biogeographical studies compare these metrics in SFB with populations of 5 exotic species in their native ranges, and with populations of 3 native species in other California estuaries. Exotic species in SFB experience enemy escape, but not always enemy release relative to similar native species. SFB populations of native species also experience partial release from digenetic trematodes relative to conspecifics in other estuaries. Multiple invasions in SFB may have altered host-parasite relationships through reduced encounter among co-evolved, and increased encounter among novel, hosts and parasites. Collectively, in SFB it appears that most native trematodes using fish as second intermediate hosts will be able to complete their life cycles using exotic species, but that trematodes using invertebrates a second intermediate hosts, except for those that use the snail C. californica, may be unable to complete their life cycles, representing an invisible form of biodiversity loss.",San Francisco,,
1451,"Secularizing San Francisco: Religion, Prostitution, and Public Policy, 1848--1917","This dissertation addresses the question: how can we make sense of secularization in the United States? The approach I adopt here is to consider secularization as the loss of religious leaders' authority to interpret controversial issues and to have a direct impact on local, state, and federal laws, regulations, policies, and procedures. I focus on religious leaders' responses to prostitution in San Francisco, California, during the years 1848-1917. Investigation involved reviewing primary source materials from archival repositories across the country. Some generalizations can be made about San Francisco religious leaders' responses to prostitution in terms of their respective religious traditions or communities. Protestant leaders sought to address causes of prostitution and to reform prostitutes. Catholic leaders attempted to remove prostitutes from public view. Jewish leaders addressed prostitution both in terms of public health and also in answer to fears about illegal international slavery operations. Responses in Chinatown included both innovations on popular religious practices from China that afforded prostitutes a recognized place in temple life, as well as Protestant missions that sought to reform prostitutes in ways that were partially adopted by Chinatown residents themselves. These responses varied in the degree to which they directly sought to change public policy. When direct engagement was attempted, religious leaders were frequently surprised at their inability to have an impact on city and state policies. This development can be seen as an illustration of secularization in San Francisco. Furthermore, I suggest that San Francisco religious leaders' lack of authority regarding prostitution can be explained in terms of local developments in labor and gender roles that occurred in the wake of the California Gold Rush. Similar developments were not evidenced in other parts of the United States until decades later, towards the close of the nineteenth century. This suggests that, at least with regard to issues related to prostitution, San Francisco secularized earlier than other parts of the country. Whether it makes sense to make broader claims about San Francisco's early secularization would require additional investigation into local religious leaders' responses to other controversial issues of the day.",San Francisco,,
1725,"City Fathers: Social Change, Economic Transformation, and the Lives of Fathers in San Francisco, 1849--1920","This dissertation addresses the critically under-studied topic of fatherhood in U.S. History. Using an array of evidence from newspapers, demographic data (including California's controversial 1852 state census), and a variety of eyewitness accounts, it describes the experiences of San Francisco's nineteenth and early twentieth-century fathers and demonstrates how the ambitions and actions of fathers as fathers helped stimulate historical change. Along the way it re-evaluates historians' understanding of gender demographics in early San Francisco, including the misperception that a large number of women were prostitutes. The dissertation employs portrayals of two archetypal San Francisco fathers as paradigms to illuminate the lives of most fathers in San Francisco during the period. James King of William was a crusading newspaper editor whose aggressive editorial voice demanded reform so that Gold Rush era San Francisco could become a place where families could prosper in safety. His influence stimulated the revolution fomented by the 1856 San Francisco Committee of Vigilance, a revolution that influenced the city's political and social order into the twentieth century. Hubert Howe Bancroft was a businessman and noted historian. His activities as a businessman helped shape the economy of California, while his activities as a historian literally made the history of the region. The study shows that Bancroft linked all his activities to his ambitions for the welfare of his family. King and Bancroft were burgher patriarchs, men who built their lives around their roles as protectors of and providers for their families. Much more than mere breadwinners, such men occupied an active and influential position at the heart of their families. The changes burgher patriarchs wrought in nineteenth-century San Francisco on behalf of their families led to social and economic shifts at the beginning of the twentieth century that turned fathers away from burgher patriarchy. These changes included a growing consumer culture, the bureaucratization of enterprise, and the expropriation of many parental duties by state and social organizations. Increasingly, fathers gained status strictly from their success as breadwinners. Their focus became work and career. Their influence within the family faded, and the dominance of burgher patriarchy ended.",San Francisco,,
512,"Modelos marginados de ejemplaridad, Sor Teresa Juliana de Santo Domingo y Sor Juana Esperanza de San Alberto : Vidas ejemplares de dos primeras monjas africanas de lengua castellana del siglo XVIII","The fundamental importance of the examination of these African nuns' lives lies not only in the revelation of the discourse strategies their writers used to avoid, emphasize or modify the color of the nuns' skin, but also in the analysis of the unusual phenomenon represented by the characters who surrounded the nuns, permitting Sister Juana Esperanza and Sister Teresa Juliana entry to cloistered institutions and, thereby, aiding them to become the subject of documentation in spite of their race. The basic bibliography for this investigation are the texts of Jose Gomez de la Parra and Juan Carlos Pan y Agua, written during the 18 th century and relating to significant events in the religious orders to which they belonged. The chronicle of the Carmelite convent Fundacion, y primero siglo del muy religioso convento del senor San Jose de religiosas carmelitas descalzas, in which is found the ""life"" of Sister Juana Esperanza de San Alberto, was written by Jose Gomez de la Parra in 1732 in honor of the centennial of the establishment of the Carmelite order in Puebla. Juan Carlos Pan y Agua wrote the Compendio de la vida ejemplar de Sor Teresa Juliana de Santo Domingo in 1752, basing the exemplary life on the funeral sermon he had delivered for the Dominican nun. Contemplating a model of female religiosity in the realms of Spain and New Spain in the late 17th to early 18th centuries could return us to an archetypical Marianite representation, whose image of purity and perfection is traditionally white, possibly brown, but rarely black. What happens when this construction of sanctity is based on something extraordinary and inserted in its deep-rooted orthodoxy? What happens when the destiny of two marginalized women, in this case two African slaves who took religious orders on either side of the Atlantic, becomes the object of exemplary religious discourse? This investigation presents the exemplary lives (vidas ejemplares) of Sister Juana Esperanza de San Alberto and Sister Teresa Juliana de Santo Domingo that, in spite of their appearance and condition, ceased to be slaves and became instead models of virtue. In addition to containing the vidas ejemplares of these African nuns, the richness of the texts themselves as well as the circumstances in which they were produced, give these writings an importance of their own. Compilations of the vidas ejemplares and the confessional autobiographies of the Carmelite nuns of Puebla are found in the chronicle of Gomez de la Parra. Pan y Aguas' compendium, based on the funeral speech of Teresa Juliana and written by the same author, contains discourse conventions which raise it above its genre and approach that of hagiography.",San Jose,,
14,Three Essays on the Economics of Fisheries Management,"Problems arising from the common-pool nature of fisheries are well known (Gordon 1954). Recent research estimates the lost economic benefits from suboptimal fisheries production to be on the order of $50 billion annually (Arnason et al. 2009). Among the most promising management tools for improving fisheries performance are closed areas (marine reserves) and rights-based management (catch shares) (Worm et al. 2009). This collection of essays examines the emergence and performance of these two policy tools from an economics perspective. The first chapter examines the determinants of the transition from command and control regulation to rights-based management in common-pool resources. I develop a conceptual framework describing a regulator's decision to adopt a rights-based management regime in a common-pool resource and empirically test the hypotheses advanced in the framework with a duration analysis of rights-based management program adoption in a group of federally managed Alaska fisheries. Consistent with the conceptual framework, I find that rent dissipation along input cost and product value dimensions increases likelihood of program adoption, and high transaction costs decrease likelihood of program adoption. I find mixed evidence that resource depletion increases probability of program adoption. The second chapter examines the capacity of marine reserves to function as a cooperation mechanism in transboundary fisheries, stocks shared by two or more jurisdictions. Using a game theoretic model, we find that marine reserve implementation can achieve first-best equilibrium economic outcomes. We illustrate our theoretical predictions with a case study of the Chilean loco fishery. The third chapter estimates the economic and biological outcomes of the implementation of a marine reserve network at the California Channel Islands in 2003 on the Santa Barbara Area red sea urchin fishery. The paper develops an integrated bioeconomic model of the fishery consisting of an age structured population model and a discrete choice model of fishermen behavior linked via the fishing mortality rate. We calibrate the model using a 15-year panel dataset of fishery data and use the calibrated model to simulate outcomes under a counterfactual no-reserve scenario. We find that eight years after reserve implementation, urchin biomass is 53.7% higher, fishery yield is 11.3% lower, and fishery revenue is 10.9% lower compared to simulated outcomes under a counterfactual no-reserve policy.",Santa Barbara,,
72,"Microbial Oxidation of Marine Hydrocarbons: Quantifying Rates of Methane, Ethane, Propane, and Butane Consumption","Samples containing low and medium natural gas concentrations were collected from the world's largest natural marine seep field, Coal Oil Point, located offshore of Santa Barbara, California. Natural gas emanating from Coal Oil Point first diffuses into sediment porewater before migrating into the overlying water column to form a dissolved plume. Novel radioactive tracers were developed and applied to assess the timing by which microbes metabolize these gases within both the water column and sediment. A three phase study was employed to track the dissolved hydrocarbon plume within the water column. Phase 1 synthesized tritiated ethane, propane, and butane using Grignard reagents and tritiated water; Phase 2 systematically assessed the experimental conditions, wherein the indigenous microbial community was found to rapidly oxidize ethane, propane, and butane; Phase 3 applied radioactive tracers to track microbial oxidation within a dissolved hydrocarbon plume. Spatial and temporal patterns of ethane, propane, and butane oxidation down current from the hydrocarbon seeps demonstrated that >99% of these gases were metabolized within 1.3 days following initial exposure. Estimates based on the observed metabolic rates and carbon mass balance calculations suggest that ethane-, propane-, and butane-consuming microorganisms may transiently account for a majority of the total microbial community within impacted waters. Samples containing high natural gas concentrations were collected from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, both during and following the nearly three-month hydrocarbon release. Microbial oxidation of ethane and propane was tracked using stable isotope (13C) tracers. Within 20 weeks of the onset of hydrocarbon release, the microbial communities had ""bloomed"" to consume elevated concentrations of ethane and propane, and subsequently ""busted"" following a prolonged period of starvation. This short time interval for complete natural gas consumption contradicts initial predictions based on previous methane studies, and indicates that oxidation rates can accelerate in environments of high hydrocarbon concentrations. Sediment studies focused on the metabolism of ethane oxidation from two individual seeps within the Coal Oil Point field: Campus Point Mounds and Patch Seep. Ethane oxidation was quantified in slurry incubations under anaerobic conditions, which indicated that >97% of the gas was removed after 43 days when incubated near in situ temperature and gas concentrations. This study was the first to quantify anaerobic ethane oxidation within cold seep sediments. Total ethane consumption rates from Campus Point Mounds and Patch Seep were calculated to be 2 microM day-1 and 0.012 microM day-1, respectively, revealing that anaerobic oxidation in sediment is a dynamic process capable of modulating ethane's release into the ocean and atmosphere. Ethane oxidation was also quantified in whole core profiles. These profiles showed elevated ethane oxidation rates to depths of 11 cm beneath the sea floor, but rates below detection in the underlying zone of low sulfate. Natural gases have many environmental consequences if released into the atmosphere due to their high global warming potentials. However, these gases are subject to oxidation by microorganisms, which act as an effective biofilter that limits the atmospheric input. Organisms responsible for this oxidation are present in a wide range of environments and hydrocarbon compositions. To quantify the rate at which a microbial community oxidizes and regulates the flux of hydrocarbons into an environment, a combination of chemical tracer techniques is typically applied. This work applied both stable and radioactive tracers to monitor the oxidation capacity of the microbial community in both water column and marine sediment, with hydrocarbon concentrations generally ranging from low (coastal systems near hydrocarbon reservoirs) to medium (natural seeps) to high (oil spills).",Santa Barbara,,
303,"Tracking Identity: Opportunity, Success, and Affiliation with Science among Fifth-Grade Latina/o Youth of Santa Barbara, California","This dissertation is an investigation into the American public education system at the elementary school level. It highlights important factors that shape the organizational structure of schools and classrooms, and in turn, how they engender disparities in the ways students experience education, namely, in the opportunities made available to them to achieve and succeed at a high level. This dissertation operates at the confluence of notions about class, gender, language, and race, especially as they revolve around public education and the hegemonic meritocratic discourse on which it is founded. This dissertation engages and contributes to scholarship within the following areas: The political economy of education; discourse and the dialectical relationship between agency and structure; cultural perspectives on identity, voice, and learning; and, Latinas/os in science education. The data that serve as the basis for the findings presented in this dissertation were collected throughout a three-phase yearlong ethnographic study of the two tracked fifth-grade classrooms at Amblen Elementary School, serving a socioeconomically disadvantaged Latina/o student population in Santa Barbara, California. In classrooms all across the nation, while it remains true that Latina/o students disproportionally take up space in the lower-tracked courses and not in the higher ones, this study does not examine inequality in tracking assignments made along ethnic/racial lines (as 100% of the students that participated in this research identify as Latina/o), rather, it investigates the consequences of what happens when Latina/o students are tracked according to symbolic markers of their ethnic/racial identity, that is, their varying levels of English language competency. Using data from participant observation, semi-structured interviews, students' drawings, as well as free-list and rank-order exercises, I was able to answer the following central research questions: In what ways do the division of students into groups (based on academic ability [i.e., English language proficiency] and behavior) impact: (a) the number and types of opportunities for Latinas/os to succeed in school science? (b) how Latinas/os negotiate the concept of 'success' in school science? And (c) the ways in which Latinas/os claim and perform successful school science identities? During my time with the fifth-grade youth of Amblen Elementary School, I found that not all students were necessarily expected to succeed in the same ways and with the same frequency. I also found that while there existed considerable overlaps, what it meant to be a ""good"" science student in one classroom was qualitatively different from what it meant in the other. Importantly, these differences in classroom expectations helped to mold (or inhibit) students' individual understandings of self as capable and/or ""smart"" students. This dissertation endeavors to tell their story.",Santa Barbara,,
319,Urban forest ecosystem analysis using fused airborne hyperspectral and lidar data,"Urban trees are strategically important in a city's effort to mitigate their carbon footprint, heat island effects, air pollution, and stormwater runoff. Currently, the most common method for quantifying urban forest structure and ecosystem function is through field plot sampling. However, taking intensive structural measurements on private properties throughout a city is difficult, and the outputs from sample inventories are not spatially explicit. The overarching goal of this dissertation is to develop methods for mapping urban forest structure and function using fused hyperspectral imagery and waveform lidar data at the individual tree crown scale. Urban forest ecosystem services estimated using the USDA Forest Service's i-Tree Eco (formerly UFORE) model are based largely on tree species and leaf area index (LAI). Accordingly, tree species were mapped in my Santa Barbara, California study area for 29 species comprising >80% of canopy. Crown-scale discriminant analysis methods were introduced for fusing Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometry (AVIRIS) data with a suite of lidar structural metrics (e.g., tree height, crown porosity) to maximize classification accuracy in a complex environment. AVIRIS imagery was critical to achieving an overall species-level accuracy of 83.4% while lidar data was most useful for improving the discrimination of small and morphologically unique species. LAI was estimated at both the field-plot scale using laser penetration metrics and at the crown scale using allometry. Agreement of the former with photographic estimates of gap fraction and the latter with allometric estimates based on field measurements was examined. Results indicate that lidar may be used reasonably to measure LAI in an urban environment lacking in continuous canopy and characterized by high species diversity. Finally, urban ecosystem services such as carbon storage and building energy-use modification were analyzed through combination of aforementioned methods and the i-Tree Eco modeling framework. The remote sensing methods developed in this dissertation will allow researchers to more precisely constrain urban ecosystem spatial analyses and equip cities to better manage their urban forest resource.",Santa Barbara,,
464,Am I Queer Enough? (White) Queer Identity Verification and The Costs of Inclusion,"With special attention to students' articulations of diversity, inclusion, and solidarity this research also provides an empirical study of how identity management processes can reinforce structural inequalities and how those processes reproduce white-hegemonic norms that impact people through their everyday interactions. Through interviews with 53 queer students and over 100 hours of participant observation at community events, I examined the identity-based processes that students used to define and enact queerness at the individual and group levels, and found that white normative standards pervaded queer ideologies and practices in this site. Commitment to inclusion was a central component of queer identity among students but the methods of inclusion valued and promoted in this community often resulted in the re-marginalization of queer of color students for whom a queer person of color (QPOC) identity marked them as a distinct subset of the queer student population. This research contributes to our understanding of identity processes and conflict within diverse social movements through incorporation of social movement, structural identity, and critical race theories to understand the complex identity-based investments of individuals who are members of diverse social justice communities. This research is an investigation into how queer students at the University of California, Santa Barbara constructed and reinforced solidarity among variously identified members of the queer community. More specifically, this research examines the significance of inclusion as a core ideological component of queer group and social identities on this campus and the racialized frames through which students conceived of inclusive queer politics. I incorporate social movement theories of collective identity, social psychological structural identity theories, and critical race theories to examine how students whose multiple sexual, racial, and gender identities were submerged within the broad category of the ""queer community"" engaged in identity verification among their peers.",Santa Barbara,,
500,"Nitrogen Dynamics in Coastal California Watersheds, Beaches, and the Nearshore Ocean","As stream runoff increased, three agricultural watersheds showed nitrate dilution, two urban watersheds showed invariance, and one undeveloped watershed showed nitrate enrichment. The undeveloped upper mountainous watershed regions were dominant contributors of water and nitrate to stream runoff and nitrate across the whole watershed during periods of high runoff, such that the variability in stream nitrate concentrations during stormflow (rainstorms) was ~ 12% of the nitrate variability during baseflow (dry periods). In beach pore water, fresh groundwater with potentially elevated nitrate is largely precluded from discharge through beach sands by the dominant coastal bluff geomorphology of the region. However, tides circulate seawater into and out of beach sands, introducing marine particulate organic matter (POM), such as phytoplankton, giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), and detrital material that is then degraded by heterotrophic microbes in beach sands to DOM and DIN. Nitrogen plays a dual role in coastal oceans. It sustains primary production, the foundation of coastal marine food webs, but can also cause degradation in the forms of eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and hypoxia when supplied in excessive quantity from urban and agricultural land uses. In this dissertation, I examined the biogeochemical, land use, and hydrologic factors that regulate the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in two nitrogen suppliers to the nearshore coastal ocean in the Santa Barbara, California region: watershed streams and beach pore water. In addition, I examined the influence of nearshore seawater and beach pore water dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition on the uptake of DIN by bacterioplankton, the primary decomposers in coastal oceans. I found that that the relationships between stream nitrate concentration and stream runoff were consistent within three broad land uses: agricultural, urban, and undeveloped. I used excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy, respiratory quotient determinations (i.e., ratio of CO2 production to O 2 consumption), and DIN concentration analysis in a 7-day time-series dark incubation to determine how variability in DOM composition in seawater and pore water influenced DIN uptake by bacterioplankton in nearshore seawater. I found that mixing of seawater and pore water promoted greater DIN uptake than occurred in pore water alone, which is likely the result of the presence of more labile seawater DOM and/or production of more labile DOM under seawater and pore water mixing. Together, the studies described herein enhance our understanding of nitrogen dynamics in coastal marine regions, and thus can enhance coastal zone management and development practices that seek to preserve the functioning of coastal marine ecosystems. I integrated pore water radon residence time distributions with DIN temporal evolution curves to calculate volume-weighted mean (VWM) DIN concentrations, which represented the DIN concentration of pore water discharging to the coastal ocean. I found that the combination of temporal variability in the residence time distribution due to spring-neap tidal cycles with the temporal evolution of DIN concentrations due to POM and DOM loading can result in substantial variability in pore water VWM DIN concentrations that should be accounted for in calculating DIN flux to coastal oceans. When pore water mixes with nearshore seawater upon discharge from the beach sands, DIN that was produced within beaches becomes available for uptake by bacterioplankton.",Santa Barbara,,
502,"Household and Community Organization at Nimatlala, an Island Chumash Village on Limuw (Santa Cruz Island), California","The Chumash living in the Santa Barbara Channel region at the time of European contact in AD 1542, and into the Early Historic period (AD 1782-1834), are described in historic documents as living a sedentary lifestyle settled in large, permanent villages. Although archaeologists working in the region today have a number of historical sources and ethnographic records to contextualize their work, little archaeological research using modern excavation and laboratory techniques has been undertaken, and much remains unknown about how the Chumash organized their households and communities and constructed economic, political, and social relationships. Results indicate that the houses were occupied by fewer individuals than was typical, although residents of the village did invest substantial labor at the sites, constructing houses and possibly a small sweat lodge. This suggests that while occupation may not have been permanent, it was significant. Residents were involved in a number of activities including the production of shell beads and ornaments, the production and maintenance of stone tools, and the collection and processing of plant and animal foods. Additionally, an analysis of the activities in which the community was engaged reveals how residents created and maintained their identity through daily practice against the backdrop of significant social, political, and economic transformation in colonial-era California. Recently, a few late prehistoric and historic sites on the Northern Channel Islands have been identified and recorded away from permanent village sites. Three of these small sites (SCRI-324, -384, -801) located in the interior of Santa Cruz Island are believed to represent the Early Historic period village of Nimatlala. These sites appear to be very different from other Early Historic period villages in that they contain smaller house depressions and shallow midden deposits. Excavation of houses and deposits at SCRI-324 and SCRI-384 was undertaken in an effort to discern the chronology of occupation, the organization of households and the community as a whole, and the nature of activities undertaken at the site.",Santa Barbara,Santa Cruz,
551,"Turnover dynamics of the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera","I found that the natural course of progressive senescence in fronds can explain much of the variability in frond loss throughout a typical year in a Santa Barbara kelp bed, that kelp blades that have more access to light have shorter lifetimes (as predicted by leaf lifespan theory), and that ignoring the sub-lethal blade area losses can result in significant underestimates of net primary productivity. I believe that internal regulation of tissue turnover is an important mechanism by which giant kelp maximizes carbon gain in a changing environment and that adaptations that increase photosynthetic efficiency may be an important factor in the widespread success and dominance of Macrocystis.. Energy fixed by primary producers supports the vast majority of life on earth. The giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera is the largest marine alga in the world and supports one of the most productive ecosystems on earth. Carbon fixed by Macrocystis pyrifera on temparate rocky reefs not only provides essential habitat for an entire community of associated species, but also provides carbon subsidies to nearby ecological communities. Net primary productivity (NPP) is often used to quantify energy fixation by autotrophs, and researchers often measure NPP by summing the incremental increases in biomass and foliar losses. While the processes governing incremental increases in biomass have been well studied, the processes that drive the loss of foliar biomass are poorly understood. I investigated drivers that regulate frond and blade lifespan in Macrocystis, and the consequences of limited frond and blade lifespans. The first chapter is a long-term, multi-site analysis of frond lifetimes and exploration of internal and external drivers that could affect frond lifetime. This study provides broad spatial and temporal scope and identifies progressive senescence as an important driver of Macrocystis biomass dynamics. The second chapter employs a more focused field study to investigate whether spatial variability in light within a kelp forests affects lifespan, size, thickness, nitrogen content and pigment content of Macrocystis pyrifera blades in ways that are predicted by theory developed to predict leaf traits of vascular plants. The last chapter is a mathematical model of the system, which I parameterized with field data, to explicitly quantify the loss of blade tissue via erosion and quantify the amount of biomass not captured in traditional surveys of net primary productivity. The main theme of my research is the investigation of the drivers that regulate the lifespan of foliar biomass of giant kelp beds near Santa Barbara, California, USA. Tissue lifespan in marine macroalgae has not received much attention from either plant ecologists or algal ecologists, despite its potential importance to the dynamics of primary productivity. Macrocystis is an ideal species for investigations on tissue lifespan in macroalgae for two main reasons. First, it is well studied and much of its biology is already known, and second, Macrocystis is locally abundant, grows fast and turns over frequently. In addition, due to relatively benign environmental conditions for Macrocystis growth, the coastal margin along the Santa Barbara Channel is an ideal location to study intrinsic properties in the absence of extreme environmental forcing (such as frequent temperature spikes and severe storm events) that could overwhelm potentially important patterns.",Santa Barbara,,
694,"Constraining the variability of optical properties in the Santa Barbara Channel, CA : A phytoplankton story","CDOM dynamics in the SBC were assessed for a 15-year study period, and this work shows that significantly large MAA Index values, e.g. MAA Index > 1, were present in approximately 16% of surface water data. Variability in CDOM spectral shape was quantified using the EOF technique, and regression analysis with EOF outputs showed that CDOM absorption intensity and spectral shape were well correlated dinoflagellate presence. Furthermore, results showed that phytoplankton biomass played a secondary role in relation to CDOM absorption, and that variability in CDOM absorption coefficients were primarily driven by community composition. CDOM quality in the SBC was also assessed using CDOM fluorescence properties via excitation emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMS). The EEMS data was analyzed using a multivariate statistical procedure, again, an EOF analysis, to identify three dominant CDOM source regimes: the surface pelagic regime, deep-water (up to 300 m) regime and kelp forest pelagic regime. This work also found that while CDOM absorption coefficient was strongly influence by which phytoplankton groups were present, DOM quality was characterized more so by the amount of phytoplankton biomass, hence indicating strong microbial component to DOM production. Lastly, with the use of the EEMS data, and characterization of CDOM absorption properties, e.g. spectral slope, S, slope ratio, SR, specific UV-absorbance, SUVA and MAA Index, we found that terrestrial sources of CDOM were very limited in the SBC. Based on this research, mineral particle concentrations that significantly correlated with IOPs were thought to be associated with suspended sediments from shoaling of the continental shelf rather than from stream/river influence. Thus, the SBC is a unique, optically complex ocean system where IOP dynamics, thus remote sensing reflectance, are strongly influenced by shifts in phytoplankton community structure. The research presented in this dissertation evaluates the direct relationships of phytoplankton community composition and inherent optical properties (IOP); that is, the absorption and scattering of light in the ocean. Phytoplankton community composition affect IOPs in both direct and indirect ways, thus creating challenges for optical measurements of biological and biogeochemical properties in aquatic systems. Studies were performed in the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC), CA where an array of optical and biogeochemical measurements were made. Phytoplankton community structure was characterized by an empirical orthogonal functional analysis (EOF) using phytoplankton accessory pigments. The results showed that phytoplankton community significantly correlated to all IOPs, e.g. phytoplankton specific absorption, detrital absorption, CDOM absorption and particle backscattering coefficients. Furthermore, the EOF analysis was unique in splitting the microphytoplankton size class into separate diatom and dinoflagellate regimes allowing for assessment optical property differences within the same size class, a technique previously not systematically achievable. The phytoplankton functional group dinoflagellates were particularly influential to IOPs in surprising ways. Dinoflagellates showed higher backscattering efficiencies than would be predicted based on Mie theory, and significantly influenced CDOM absorption via direct association with dissolved mycosproine-like amino acid absorption (MAA) peaks in CDOM spectra. A new index was developed in this work to quantify MAA absorption peaks in CDOM spectra, and was named the MAA Index. Prior to this research dissolved MAA absorption in natural waters was never quantified, and CDOM data containing these peaks were often disregarded and discarded from analysis.",Santa Barbara,,
701,"An examination of the relationship between perceived disaster-related stress, family protective factors, and children's positive and negative adjustment after wildfire exposure","Although family-level factors have been identified as important predictors of child functioning in the aftermath of disaster, the relationship between family risk and protective factors and child adjustment in the context of disaster remains unclear (Weems & Overstreet, 2008; Norris, Friedman, Watson, Byrne, Diaz & Kaniasty, 2002; Gewirtz, Forgatch & Weiling, 2008). In addition, the majority of research on child functioning in the aftermath of disasters investigates the impact of various family-level factors on negative child outcomes and tends to ignore investigation of positive adjustment or factors that lead to resilience in the context of disaster (Kilmer & Gil-Rivas, 2010). In order to address the present gaps in the field, this project used data from both children and parents to investigate and clarify the relationship between perceived disaster-related stress, family-level protective factors and children's negative and positive adjustment following three devastating wildfires that occurred in Santa Barbara County in 2008-2009. Participants included 50 families who were living in homes that were damaged or destroyed by the fires or were forced to evacuate. Results indicated that child gender and children's perceived social support were significant predictors of children's emotional symptoms as reported by children, but not as reported by parents. In addition, findings suggested that children's perceived social support served as a moderator of the relationship between perceived fire-related stress and children's prosocial behaviors, as reported by parents. Clinical and research implications of these findings are discussed.",Santa Barbara,,
793,"Characterizing Methane Emissions at Local Scales with a 20 Year Total Hydrocarbon Time Series, Imaging Spectrometry, and Web Facilitated Analysis","Methane is an important greenhouse gas for which uncertainty in local emission strengths necessitates improved source characterizations. Although CH4 plume mapping did not motivate the NASA Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) design and municipal air quality monitoring stations were not intended for studying marine geological seepage, these assets have capabilities that can make them viable for studying concentrated (high flux, highly heterogeneous) CH4 sources, such as the Coal Oil Point (COP) seep field (_0.015 Tg CH4 yr-1) offshore Santa Barbara, California. Hourly total hydrocarbon (THC) data, spanning 1990 to 2008 from an air pollution station located near COP, were analyzed and showed geologic CH4 emissions as the dominant local source. A band ratio approach was developed and applied to high glint AVIRIS data over COP, resulting in local-scale mapping of natural atmospheric CH4 plumes. A Cluster-Tuned Matched Filter (CTMF) technique was applied to Gulf of Mexico AVIRIS data to detect CH4 venting from offshore platforms. Review of 744 platform-centered CTMF subsets was facilitated through a flexible PHP-based web portal. This dissertation demonstrates the value of investigating municipal air quality data and imaging spectrometry for gathering insight into concentrated methane source emissions and highlights how flexible web-based solutions can help facilitate remote sensing research.",Santa Barbara,,
797,"Using Laser Scanning Technology to Monitor Coastal Erosion and Sea-Cliff Retreat in Southern Santa Barbara County, California","Establishing sea-cliff erosion rates is a vital component of coastal zone management. Laser scanning technology can provide a fast, reliable, and accurate means to survey sea-cliffs covering large areas of the coastline and to establish local erosion rates. The technology allows for the rapid laterally continuous survey of sea-cliffs with Dynamic Laser Scanning (DLS) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys. Data collected from DLS and LiDAR surveys for southern Santa Barbara County were compared in a Geographic Information System (GIS). This study establishes regional erosion rates using NOAA LiDAR data along southern Santa Barbara County coastal bluffs from Point Conception to Rincon Point (Carpinteria, California). Regional retreat rates for southern Santa Barbara County calculated in GIS from 1998 and 2010 NOAA LiDAR data range from 4 to 73 cm yr-1. Local erosion rates were also established along Lagoon Road on the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus and at Point Conception. The average retreat rate at UCSB calculated from 1997 LiDAR and 2012 DLS data was 24 cm yr-1. Areas along Lagoon Road protected by rip rap have lower average retreat rates of 15 cm yr-1. The Lagoon Road retreat rates are similar to manually surveyed rates along these same cliffs. Erosion rates along the Lagoon Road sea-cliff with active drain pipes, seepage, and tree falls were expected to experience higher cliff erosion rates than sections of the sea-cliff without these influences, but the results of this study did not confirm my hypothesis. Retreat rates at Lagoon Road were higher than retreat rates at Point Conception. The higher rates are attributed to the presence of excessive surface runoff and the orientation of the dip of the beds. Comparison of 100 m of overlapping DLS data along Lagoon Road from November 2011 and January 2012 suggests that the top of the cliff is retreating at a higher rate than the base, which is a consequence of excess surface runoff. The aspect of the sea-cliff was also found to have an influence on erosion rates, with higher retreat rates correlating to south facing sea-cliffs. Unless measures are taken to impede the current rate of erosion along Lagoon Road, the road will be undercut in 60 years.",Santa Barbara,,
863,Social Movement Continuity and Abeyance: Feminist Mobilization on U.S. College Campuses,"Social movement abeyance theorizes the persistence of social movements during times that are antagonistic to mobilization. In this dissertation, I argue that U.S. feminism is currently in abeyance and that educational institutions are generative environments for abeyance structures. Drawing on theories of women's movements, student movements, and movements inside institutions, I provide a systematic updating of abeyance theory. The study's design is comparative: the three field sites are Smith College, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and the University of California-Santa Barbara, which are not only in three different regions of the U.S. but also have diverse student demographics and activist cultures. I employ both qualitative and quantitative methods and include semi-structured interviews (n=75), participant observation, and a survey of college students on each campus (n=1,400). I highlight three variable dimensions that help us understand the unique nature of social movements in abeyance: fields of contention, collective identity, and tactical repertoires. I argue that during periods in which mobilized participants have little support: a) institutions of higher education provide welcome environments for feminist mobilization, often in unexpected locations such as multi-cultural sororities and student government; b) feminist collective identities nest or ""spill over"" to influence other social movements including queer, anti-racist, and anti-fee hike organizations; and c) tactics move on-line, especially to social networking sites. The dissertation also attends to larger theoretical questions pertaining to emerging forms of political contestation and the persistence of social movements based on fundamental cleavages of gender, race/ethnicity, class, and sexuality.",Santa Barbara,,
869,"A comprehensive analysis of precipitation in Santa Barbara, California, on hourly to interannual timescales","Extreme precipitation (90th percentile), defined in terms of both the intensity and persistence of rainfall, has been linked to various natural hazards throughout the world including floods and landslides. The variations of precipitation extremes are particularly important in southern California with its pronounced seasonal rainfall regime and landscape that is prone to fire events. The historical variability of precipitation in Santa Barbara County is examined on varying timescales and then compared to several phenomena believed to control precipitation in the region. Hourly precipitation data are gathered from seven local stations covering roughly the past forty years (1970--2010). The climatology of precipitation in the region including intensity and persistences of storm episodes is examined. The patterns and variations of precipitations are then compared to three main teleconnection phenomena: the El Nino Southern Oscillation, the Madden-Julian Oscillation, and atmospheric rivers. The underlying goal of this research is to gain a comprehensive understanding of precipitation climatology in the region and the features that influence control over it. Ultimately this knowledge will be used to gauge the conditions necessary for a ""perfect storm"" event to occur within the Santa Barbara region.",Santa Barbara,,
980,Stretching Limited Resources Here and There: A Multi-Sited Ethnographic Study of Migrants from Guerrero in the United States,"This dissertation examines the interplay between processes of globalization and transnational migration and their impact at the micro level in the understudied area of gendered household economic strategies in both sending and receiving communities. Drawing on a multi-sited ethnography study which employed a two-phase mixed methods approach, I analyzed migration histories, occupational mobility, migration dispersion in the U.S., and household economic strategies, in two transnational communities: 1) Acayahualco, Guerrero Mexico and Santa Barbara, CA and 2) Mayanalan, Guerrero Mexico and Wilmington, DE. To ascertain key socio-demographic features of the populations under study, I developed a 162-item survey that I administered to 90 households in the sending communities of Guerrero, Mexico. The survey results were both complemented and challenged by my multi-sited ethnographic research comprising 50 in-depth interviews, along with participant observation in the sending and receiving communities. This study offers two contributions to sociology: in the one hand it examines the ways in which globalization takes place at the local level, specifically in the social context of international migration. By undertaking this type of dialectic analysis of the global and the local, this study sheds light on the individual's response capabilities and, more importantly, on their agency power in the face of global processes. This proactive agency on the part of the transnational migrant families becomes evident as they are observed looking constantly for ways to ""stretch their limited resources"" to cover expenses by relying on their unlimited resourcefulness. In this context, international migration should not be viewed simply as a survival strategy for peasant families, but, as a mechanism of reaction and resistance against global capitalism barriers. On the other hand, I demonstrated throughout this work, the social phenomenon of international migration in these two communities, and within their domestic units, is the result of an accumulative and uninterrupted process that has been shaped by a vast number of learning experiences, social and cultural exchanges, and innovative and resourceful practices to cope with the challenges of becoming transnational. The transnational perspective allows us to underscore how, in spite of being physically separated by great distances, the development of household economic strategies by migrants and their families are deeply linked. This transnational linkage allows migrants and their families in their communities of origins to cope with the challenges of a globalized economy that has been detrimental to their living conditions. In this sense, the results of my study counter the view that sees migrants and their families in their communities of origin as puppets controlled by forces beyond their own control. Rather, this study emphasizes how migrants and their families with hard-working ethics look for opportunities to improve their socioeconomic circumstances and enhance their living conditions.",Santa Barbara,,
1035,Design and Calibration of Wide-Area Camera Networks,"Advancements in sensing, processing, communications, and power technologies have enabled vast numbers of inexpensive wireless cameras that can observe a wide area. This dissertation addresses the challenges of designing a wide-area camera network and finding the spatial and temporal relationships between the cameras. In particular, we examine the challenges of calibrating non-overlapping cameras, aligning unsynchronized cameras with variable frame rates, and synchronizing cameras with variable frame rates. This research is largely motivated by the Scalable, Large Optical Sensor Network (SCALLOPSNet), a wide-area network deployed across the University of California, Santa Barbara. This dissertation describes the features of this network and the data that is used to validate our solutions. The first challenge is the 3D calibration of cameras with non-overlapping views. We propose to calibrate each camera in a global geographic coordinate system that is introduced by a mobile device, such as a smartphone. We formulate this geo-calibration as a maximum-likelihood estimation of the position and orientation of each camera given multimodal sensor measurements from a mobile device. The mobile devices record multiple images that overlap with the camera to be calibrated with its GPS location and 3D orientation. We show that this estimation can be solved using a consensus algorithm. The second challenge is the alignment of overlapping cameras that have unsynchronized start times and variable frame rates. We use the intersections of object trajectories as a reliable feature point that can be matched across views. The potential matching intersections are derived from matching trajectories. Trajectories are matched by, first, representing the spatial and temporal relationships between trajectories in a view in a Spatio-Temporal Context Graph and, then, matching these graphs across views. The final challenge is the synchronization of overlapping cameras with variable frame rates. Existing methods address cameras with fixed frame rates and known homographies. We formulate the problem mathematically to include variable frame rates, clock drift, and clock skew. The proposed solution is based on matching intersections of object trajectories. Addressing these challenges advances the state of the art in deploying wide-area camera networks. In particular, it enables the deployment of wireless cameras with non-overlapping views or unsynchronized frames.",Santa Barbara,,
1042,Self-Formulations of Embodied Action in Naturally Occurring Interaction,"As conversation analysts have shown, participants can achieve a variety of social actions via talk alone (as with telephone conversations), or alternately via embodied behavior in the absence of talk. In some instances, however, people use talk in conjunction with embodied behavior, articulating precisely what it is they are doing (or alternately, what they would like recipients to believe they are doing). Drawing upon digital videos from the University of California, Santa Barbara's vast collection of naturally occurring interactions, cases in which the aforementioned practice occurs were identified, collected, and analyzed using the established methods of conversation analysis. Self-formulations of embodied actions were found in one of three sequential positions relative to the actions they explicate: before the commission of an action, after its completion or abandonment, or while an action was still underway. Generally, self-formulations either serve as a prophylactic against potential trouble or in response to trouble that has actually transpired. Self-formulations provide recipients with an ""official account"" of what a person is about to do, has done (or tried to do), or is involved with doing. In formulating their actions, participants show themselves to be oriented not only to possible interactional troubles, but also to the fact that recipients routinely monitor others' in-progress actions, drawing inferences about their import.",Santa Barbara,,
1134,Culture in a Writing Program: An Organizational Case Study,"This study explored the perceptions of the staff and faculty of one writing program in a large western university, the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). The Writing Program had experienced significant changes including budgetary reductions since 2008 as well as turnover in leadership. These changes have impacted the culture of the organization. Interest in organizational culture is related to a larger concern in organizational theory with managing uncertainty. Martin (1992; 2002) suggests that all organizations exhibit levels of ambiguity or uncertainty. To describe and explain how the writing program used in this study deals with uncertainty and change in the environment over time, I used Martin's (1992; 2002) three perspective theory of organizational culture. This study primarily used qualitative interviewing, informed by the single case study design (Yin, 2009). The study was actualized in two phases; wherein Phase 1 served as a pilot study for Phase 2. The findings showed that challenges to the Writing Program included turnover in the director position and an uncertain budgetary climate in the university at large. From an integration perspective, the leaders of the Writing Program fostered a shared culture of collegiality and generosity. Subcultures in Phase 1 and Phase 2 were generally similar. Informants in both phases identified subcultures across disciplines and curricular focus as well as administration and instructional staff. Through the lens of the fragmentation perspective the Writing Program exhibited elements of fragmentation in both phases. During Phase 1 informants were concerned about the Writing Program's status as a function of its position as a less powerful program within the university. During Phase 2 newer organizational members revealed that they did not identify with certain subcultures and did not always know what issues and problems were at odds in the program. The personnel review process, lead by the personnel committee chair, provided a source of high personal uncertainty and organizational ambiguity. In this study Martin's (1992) perspectives facilitated description and explanation of organizational culture. By viewing people and organizations as integrated, differentiated, and fragmented, nuance and complexity are acknowledged as part of shared existence.",Santa Barbara,,
1156,Spatial perspectives in business establishment behavioral modeling: A case-study analysis in santa barbara county,"Representation of economic agents and their activity in integrated land-use and transportation models is increasingly becoming disaggregate thereby requiring the corresponding spatial environment also to be represented in much finer detail. This representation can greatly benefit by thoroughly operationalizing and emphasizing the critical element of `location' in better understanding spatial behavior of business establishments within this framework. This dissertation research study strives to contribute to this growing body of knowledge in three major directions. First, presented is a methodological framework that captures for each location properties in-terms of its closeness, intermediacy, straightness and accessibility to all other locations in any study area. Second, we present a modeling approach to comprehensively assess the locational impacts on economic efficiency of business establishments, thereby identifying the highest and lowest performers in the region. Finally, we make a case to use dynamic analysis in thoroughly investigating the spatial dimension of business establishment lifecycle events as related to business establishment formation, relocation and dissolution. Results from this dissertation clearly reveal the presence of a core-periphery (or center-sub center) type of a city model in Santa Barbara County. Furthermore, the results from the network-centrality indicators also suggest that geometric configuration and structure of the transportation network have a prominent role in spatial organization of economic activities in the region. Business establishments' economic efficiency is also significantly influenced (positive or negative) by the relative location in the regional transportation network of each establishment. For instance, retail trade business establishments located in downtown areas of Santa Barbara and Santa Maria have the highest levels of efficiency (maximizing profits) in the region. Moreover, business establishments' internal attributes also have a profound impact of business establishment efficiency, with larger and older business establishments being more efficient than business establishments that are smaller in size and younger in age. Also, access to public transportation in the region has a positive effect on business establishment economic efficiency, especially for business establishments in retail trade, professional and healthcare services. Model estimation results clearly reveal the presence of spatial heterogeneity in business establishment lifecycle events of formation, relocation and dissolution in the region. For instance, highly central locations in the region such as downtown areas have a higher probability of business establishment formation along with lower likelihood for business establishment dissolution. Furthermore, professional service business establishments located along major local and collector roads in these locations are in spatially ""sticky"" locations and survive longer. Overall, however, the results suggest that lifecycle events of business establishments as related to birth, relocation and failure are primarily triggered by changes in business establishment internal attributes.",Santa Barbara,Santa Maria,
1220,Goal Orientation and Motivational Patterns Among Underrepresented Minority Junior High School Students From Low-Income Immigrant Families in a College Preparation Program,"The focus of this study is the analysis and evaluation of critical transitions and critical conditions among underrepresented minority (URM) junior high school students from immigrant families participating in a program of academic improvement in Santa Barbara, CA. The study examined the 2 x 2 pattern of achievement goal orientation (Elliot & McGregor, 2001); motivational dispositions, including academic efficacy, academic self-handicapping, disruptive behavior, self-presentation of low achievement, and skepticism about the relevance of school for future success; and academic performance among junior high school minority students from low-income immigrant families participating in a college preparation program called Pathways. The validation of achievement goal orientation of these students was measured using psychometric methods as a means of ensuring its validity and reliability. The students' goal orientation was identified by using a cluster analysis method and later linked to student academic motivation and achievement. The cluster analysis identified four clusters of students with different goal orientation profiles in the math classroom subject and five clusters in the English classroom subject. Despite the slight differences across the four profiles, certain aspects of the goal orientation patterns exhibited by the groups were shared across the two domains (i.e., math and English classroom subjects). Students who exhibited a pattern in which mastery-approach and performance-avoidance goals were dominant showed the most positive motivational and achievement profile. In contrast, students who belonged to flat or semiflat goal orientation profiles, where none of any type of goals was dominant, showed negative academic beliefs, strategies, and lower academic outcomes. While students whose flat profile were high in all goals performed slightly better than those in the profile that scored low in all goals, nevertheless, both of the flat goal orientation profiles exhibited lower academic motivation and achievement than students with at least one dominant goal. The finding also illustrated the relationship between goal orientation profiles and students' sociodemographic characteristics. The analysis of students' achievement goal orientation in connection to students' academic-related perceptions, beliefs, and strategies is crucial in understanding how students learn and process information, and how we can further improve an academic preparation program, such as Pathways, by tailoring it to the needs of students from historically underrepresented groups and enhance their access to higher education.",Santa Barbara,,
1306,"Methods for Mapping Chlorophyll Biomass Distributions Below the Euphotic Zone in the Santa Barbara Channel, California","Both physical and biological processes can export phytoplankton to depths below the euphotic zone. The role of physical transport in exporting chlorophyll biomass to depth was evaluated in the Santa Barbara Channel using data from 16 seasonal cruises during the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research project (SBC-LTER). Measurements included surveys of CTD casts, towed transects using instrumented, undulating vehicles (ScanFish and TRIAXUS), surface currents from an array of high-frequency radars, and an underway acquisition system for near-surface water properties, meteorological variables, and currents from ship-board acoustic Doppler current profilers. Data from highly-resolved towed transects were calibrated using the complementary CTD data; in particular, calibrations were obtained for chlorophyll fluorometers on the towed profilers. Data from the towed profilers were interpolated onto a regular grid using ordinary Kriging. By combining Kriged data sets with euphotic zone depths from the CTD grids, the fraction of total chlorophyll biomass below the euphotic zone was estimated for the channel-wide surveys and compared among cruises, with a minimum of 8%, a maximum of 41%, and a mean of 24% (+/-11%) of chlorophyll found at depth for an entire cruise. Along-isopycnal mixing and advection [Washburn et al, 1991] and submesoscale eddy processes [Dong et al., 2012] appear to be important for transporting significant amounts of chlorophyll biomass to depth.",Santa Barbara,,
1310,A Study of Dual Enrollment and Community College Persistence,"This study examined archival institutional data of former dual enrollment students and their direct entry peers who were first-time college students at Santa Barbara City College (SBCC). The sample of 764 students graduated from local service area high schools in spring 2008 and matriculated to SBCC in fall 2008. The study compared measures of achievement and indicators of persistence for all students over three academic years, ending spring 2011, and used measures of statistical significance to determine if differences existed based on prior dual enrollment status and location of dual enrollment experience. Measurements of persistence included enrollment full-time versus part-time and college transferable unit accumulation. Achievement leading to persistence was determined by placement into college-level coursework, grade point average at two points in time, and completion of college transferable units. Differences between former dual enrollment students and their direct entry peers were statistically significant. Former dual enrollment students were more likely to enroll full-time, required less basic skills remediation, achieved higher average GPAs, and accumulated more transferable college units. Further statistical analysis compared student records by three locations of dual enrollment experience: high school campus, college campus, or a combination of both the high school and college campuses. Data analyses indicated that former dual enrollment students who took courses on their high school campus and the college campus enrolled full-time at a higher rate, earned a higher average GPA at both points of measurement, placed into college-level math and English courses at a higher rate, and achieved more transferable college units than any other subgroup.",Santa Barbara,,
1365,Acoustic properties of coda liquids in Californian English,"Lateral and rhotic consonants have been known to pattern together as liquids since the Ancient Greek grammarian Dionysius Thrax (Walsh 1997; Proctor 2009). Synchronic and diachronic processes which affect one liquid in a language are likely to affect all liquids in the language. The English rhotic [r\\] has been shown to epenthesize in post-vocalic environments, such as in idear or drawring, a phenomenon known as intrusive-R. This rhotic also lenites in other dialects in words like quart and mother (Gick 1999). In parallel, the English lateral [l] may be epenthesized in a rarer, but documented, phenomenon known as intrusive-L, which affects the same environments as intrusive-R (Gick 2002). Similarly, coda-L is optionally pronounced in some words such as folk, palm, and calm, suggesting a similar process of lenition. While it is well-established that the English rhotic [r/] may serve as the syllable peak in certain words such as church, bird, and verb, little work as investigated the possibility of a lateral syllable peak in analogous words such as milk, filled, and help. The current study examines coda-position liquids in closed syllables from native California speakers in the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English (Du Bois et al. 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005) to create a model predicting liquid sonority based on liquid type, speaker gender, lexical stress, and other phonological features. Additionally, following MRI work by Gick et al. (2002), the formant values of liquids are examined to determine the similarity of liquids to vowels and the influence adjacent vowels may have on the shape of a liquid. Given that coda-position [r/] may be the syllable peak in certain closed syllables, we expect coda-position [l] to behave similarly. Finally, since the findings of Gick et al. (2002) suggest that the articulation of /r// and /l/ are most similar to /[schwa]/ and /[open o]/, respectively, it is predicted that the formant structure of these sonorous liquids will mirror the formant structure of these two vowels. The results indicate that liquids in Californian English exhibit similar patterns regarding sonority under certain conditions, although rhotics may be more vowel-like than laterals.",Santa Barbara,,
1372,The Other Side of Hunger: Everyday Experiences of Mexican and Central American Migrant Women with Food Insecurity in Santa Barbara County,"This dissertation examines food insecurity in the context of displacement and transnational migration of women from Mexico and Central America to the US. Drawing upon 18 months of ethnographic fieldwork conducted between 2008 and 2011 in the coastal region of Santa Barbara, California, I advance and contribute to several arguments. In presenting the lived experience of ""food insecurity"", I analyze the everyday forms of structural violence that shape the experience of migrant women, particularly in terms of food, health, and bodies, and I critique interventions to food insecurity and ""diet-related health problems"" implemented by state and nonprofit agencies. I argue that through their everyday struggles and interactions with groups providing assistance, migrant women navigate power differentials rooted in distinctions of race, class, gender, and legal status while also negotiating and performing new modes of citizenship. Using data from participant observation, surveys, semi-structured interviews, life history interviews, and focus groups, I seek to answer the following research questions: What is the lived experience of food insecurity among Mexican and Central American migrant women in the US, and what are the structural forces contributing to this experience? At the local level, how do nonprofit entities and public health practitioners engage in the discourse and practice of food security, particularly as it affects migrant women? And, what do the lived experience of food insecurity and interventions by state and non-state actors reveal about changing notions of rights and citizenship and about the production of class and structural violence? The answers to these questions help inform my engagement with and contribution to four primary bodies of scholarship: political economy of food and migration; political ecology of food and health; ideas of power, the state, and hegemony; and critical approaches to race, class, gender, and citizenship. In engaging with the core themes of this dissertation---food, health, and citizenship---I analyze the dialectical relationship between structural conditions and individual agency. I use the rhetoric of ""the other side"" ( el otro lado), a phrase invoked by migrant women to reference life outside of the US (specifically on the other side of the US-Mexico border), to underscore the variety of borders that limit access to livelihood resources for unauthorized migrants living in the US.",Santa Barbara,,
1415,Risk convergence model: A model of media's influence on self-other social distance and personal risk perceptions,"A considerable body of research has identified five audience variables---identification, parasocial interaction, personal relevance, transportation, and perceived realism---that facilitate media effects on personal risk perceptions. The literature in this area, however, remains stagnant and fragmented, as research concerning these variables has yet to be effectively integrated to offer a parsimonious account of the underlying process. The present research represents an effort to integrate this disjointed literature by proposing the risk convergence model, a theoretical framework that postulates the reduction of perceived social distance between the self and others depicted in the media as a unifying mechanism whereby media can influence personal risk perceptions. In an initial test of this model, 500 undergraduate students at the University of California, Santa Barbara, participated in an experiment employing 2 (high vs. low transportation) x 2 (diagnosis vs. scare storyline) between-subjects factorial design. Participants were exposed to entertainment clips that either portrayed a main character who is diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease (STD; diagnosed storyline) or thinks he/she might have caught an STD and gets scared of testing for it (scare storyline). Overall, the risk convergence model received solid support from the data, with all paths emerging as significant except for the link between perceived realism and social distance. Specifically, reduction of social distance completely mediated the relationship between identification, transportation and personal risk perceptions, thus suggesting social distance as a valid causal mechanism of the process involving the two variables. Personal relevance was found to both directly and indirectly (via reduction of social distance) influence personal risk, while perceived realism did not show any significant associations with social distance and personal risk perceptions. The findings suggest that reduction of social distance may be the underlying mechanism that can explain media's influence on personal risk perceptions and that the four audience involvement variables possess distance-reducing qualities that allow them to influence personal risk perceptions.",Santa Barbara,,
1445,The Spatial Context of Donations to Political Campaigns,"The Federal Elections Commission database of political donors reveals that donations to political campaigns are spatially dependent.

1509,Ecohydrologic model uncertainty and application in an urban environment: The RHESSys model in Mission Creek,"In water-stressed semi-arid areas, the impact of urbanization on ecohydrologic processes such as vegetation water use and net primary productivity is of concern. This dissertation seeks to increase understanding of ecohydrologic processes within an urban and semi-arid context through the application of an ecohydrological model (the Regional Ecohydrologic Simulation System, RHESSys) to the Mission Creek catchment in Santa Barbara County, CA. The analysis first quantifies the impact of uncertainties from both calibrated soil parameters and inputs (precipitation scaling, temperature, and outdoor water use) on model output. I find that the relative impact of different sources of uncertainty varies throughout the water year and with the model output of interest. Early in the water year (Oct-Nov), soils are relatively dry and soil parameters exert a strong control on streamflow. As the rainy season progresses and soils become more saturated, streamflow becomes more sensitive to uncertainty in the scaling of precipitation with elevation. In the spring and summer months, modeled ET becomes more sensitive to calibrated soil parameters and outdoor water use as plant water demands increase and soil water stores are utilized for ET. I next devised and tested a series of alternative calibration approaches aimed at reducing the potential for observation and input error to introduce bias in the calibration process. I find that valuing stability of model performance across the calibration period results in the selection of soil parameters with more consistent performance between calibration and evaluation periods. I also find that filtering periods of suspected error or model weakness from the calibration period will greatly alter the distribution of acceptable parameter sets. Surprisingly, calibrating across a range of precipitation scaling uncertainty does not change the relative performance of different parameter sets. Finally, I use the calibrated model to conduct an analysis of the role of effective impervious surface area (EIA) on vegetation water use and productivity. I demonstrate that connectivity between impervious areas and the drainage network can influence modeled vegetation water use and productivity: reducing the EIA fraction of total impervious area increases runoff infiltration and can mitigate or even cancel reduction in vegetation water use and NPP directly due to vegetation loss with increased impervious surface coverage. My results indicate that runoff from impervious surfaces into neighboring vegetated areas can increase transpiration and NPP in these vegetated areas well into the dry season. As an extended dry season is common to Mediterranean sites, this finding is of interest with regards to maximizing vegetation productivity in water stressed urban areas while minimizing the need for additional water inputs from irrigation. A first order approximation of the EIA fraction into a catchment scale model indicates that the effect of accounting for the EIA fraction on model ET and NPP estimates will vary between wet and dry years, with an increasing effect during wet years and a minimal effect during dry years.",Santa Barbara,,
1525,Dispersal in Marine Systems: Identifying interactions between marine larvae and ocean currents with implications for biogeographic patterns,"The accurate description of marine dispersal is an ongoing challenge. Recent efforts have led to an improved understanding of larval dispersal, but there remains a paucity of studies that describe average dispersal patterns for marine species or examine the effects of dispersal on large-scale biogeographical patterns. This work first reviews literature on what role of physical features play haping species distributions through dispersal limitation in terrestrial and marine species. The review suggests that while there is some evidence that marine species distributions can be shaped by physical barriers to dispersal, there is far less work devoted to the issue than in terrestrial systems. In the third chapter, we present a new tool to measure larval abundance. We adapted existing protocols that label larvae using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and combined them with recent cell sorting technology (CS) so that larvae could be quickly and accurately sorted from plankton samples. Between chapters III and IV, we present DNA probes for three bivalve taxa: Musculista senhousia, Mytilus edulis/galloprovincialis/trossulus, and Mytilus californianus/Septifer spp, and one barnacle grouping of Tetraclita rubescens/ Chthamalus spp. In the fourth chapter, we employ FISH-CS to monitor the abundance of barnacle and mussel larvae in the Santa Barbara Harbor (SBH), California. Using these abundance data, we determined that the barnacle T. rubescens likely arrives at SBH from more distant sites while the mussels M. californianus and Septifer remain near SBH throughout development. In addition, we found that early- and late-stage barnacles were concentrated onshore by internal tides but mussels were not. Finally, we tested the theory that ocean currents can sufficiently limit larval dispersal to establish species' range limits, and examined the effects of a leaky barrier. We found the settlement of Septifer was significantly lower on the northern side of a potential current-driven dispersal filter at Point Conception, California. This decreased settlement corresponds with the species' northern range boundary. Current reversals were found to be correlated with increased settlement beyond the species' range edge, but the settlement was significantly lower than that observed within the adult distribution.",Santa Barbara,,
1592,Modeling Evacuation Vulnerability,"Emergency evacuations are essential for protecting people from hazardous events such as wildfires, tsunamis, hurricanes, industrial accidents, and terrorist actions. One way to assess the effectiveness of an evacuation plan is through mathematical models that represent the road topology, population characteristics, and hazard conditions of a specific geographic area. Current emergency evacuation models are often based upon assumptions about spatial behavior that may poorly represent human actions during an actual evacuation. Our research challenges these assumptions with empirical data from a survey of people in Santa Barbara affected by the Jesusita Fire. The stay-or-go decision of people living in a mandatory evacuation area is of critical importance to emergency managers, thus we use survival analysis to measure the impact of risk perception, distance from the fire, and environmental conditions on this decision. Another critical decision made by evacuees is which route to take when evacuating, thus we analyze empirical evacuation route data and determine which wayfinding strategies were employed by Jesusita Fire evacuees. We develop a Rayleigh probability model and a network flow model based on the results of these analyses, which are integrated with a traffic microsimulation of our study area. This simulation allows us to generate evacuation time estimates that explicitly account for behavioral uncertainty, and to assess the effectiveness of different traffic management strategies. The objectives of this research are to develop a better understanding of spatial behavior during an emergency evacuation, and develop new models that may help reduce evacuation vulnerability.",Santa Barbara,,
1609,Spatial Patterns in Recruitment and Development of the Assemblage of Sessile Epibenthic Invertebrates in Santa Barbara Harbor,"Harbors and coastal embayments serve as focal points of invasion by sessile epibenthic invertebrates. Despite considerable information on the geographic distribution of such taxa, information on the patterns of their small-scale spatial variability and the importance of local environmental factors that influence these patterns is needed to better manage the spread of invasive species. Here I (1) quantify spatial patterns in recruitment of sessile epibenthic invertebrates of non-native, native and cryptogenic origins within Santa Barbara Harbor (SBH), (2) assess the extent to which spatial patterns in recruitment could be explained by variations in local environmental factors, and (3) evaluate the extent to which spatial patterns in recruitment could account for observed patterns of spatial variation in natural assemblages within the harbor. The majority of invertebrate taxa found on SBH's floating docks (75%) and on recruitment plates (91%) were of non-native or cryptogenic origins. The non-native tunicates Ciona spp. (C. savygni and C. intestinalis) and Diplosoma listerianum, the bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata, the native bryozoan Celleporaria brunnea, and the taxonomically unresolved spirorbid polychaetes showed strong spatial patterns in recruitment within the harbor. Recruitment of Ciona spp. was negatively associated with water flow, whereas that of D. listerianum and W. subtorquata was positively associated with the presence of conspecifics on the floating docks. Spatial patterns in recruitment of two taxa ( Celleporaria brunnea and spirorbid polychaetes) were not associated with any measured environmental factor. However, spatial patterns in recruitment were positively associated with proportional cover of the epibenthic assemblage after 12 months of development for Ciona spp., C. brunnea and spirorbid polychaetes. My results indicate that variation in water flow and the presence of conspecifics significantly influenced spatial patterns in recruitment within SBH for three of the five invertebrate taxa. Observational and experimental evidence suggests that water flow plays a significant role in the initial establishment of Ciona spp. However, other factors, such as competition for space, or mortality may also influence longer-term development of the epibenthic assemblage. Understanding the relationship between environmental factors and patterns in recruitment may improve our ability to predict the distribution of epibenthic invertebrate invasions. These results may be used to develop a predictive framework that considers location within a harbor, as well as harbor design, to optimize boat-hull cleaning strategies (e.g., frequency and timing) and target problem species.",Santa Barbara,,

1690,Community Based Fisheries Research on California Spiny Lobster (Panulirus interruptus) at the Santa Barbara Channel Islands,"This dissertation describes collaborative fisheries research (CFR) on California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) at the Santa Barbara Channel Islands (SBCI). The research goals addressed in this work include: (1) establishing a collaborative approach to gathering fisheries data for assessments and management; (2) assessment of marine reserves at SBCI; (3) estimating mortality rates of lobsters populations throughout the SBCI marine reserve network; and (4) construction of fisheries models that provide context for interpreting mortality rates I estimated. CFR enhanced assessment of marine reserves established in 2003 at the SBCI in terms of their impact in P. interruptus population structure and fishery interactions. After six years of reserve protection, there was a four to eight-fold increase in trap yield, a 5 -- 10% increase in the mean size (carapace length) of legal sized lobsters, and larger size structure of lobsters trapped inside versus outside of three replicate reserves. Patterns in trap data were corroborated by visual SCUBA surveys that indicated a four to six-fold increases in lobster density inside reserves. These results indicate that marine reserves have strong conservation benefits for P. interruptus. Inside reserves, trap performance (the number and mean size of legal-sized lobsters caught in traps) was significantly influenced by proximity to reserve borders, a pattern that suggests net emigration of lobster from inside reserves to adjacent fished areas (spillover). Interestingly, spillover was not apparent in trap yields or commercial fishery effort distribution outside reserves, nor was it apparent in tagging studies. This suggests that spillover from reserves may have little influence of fishery yield outside reserves. However, yield due to spillover might increase as the reserves age and lobster biomass continues to increase inside reserves. Mean total mortality (Z) of female lobsters was lower at sites inside reserves (Z = 0.21 [+/-0.07 SE]) than at sites outside reserves (Z = 0.59 [+/-0.02 SE]). Mean mortality at all sites inside reserves, and among sites near reserve centers (where Z = 0.17 [+/-0.05 SE]), was similar to estimates of natural mortality for other temperate spiny lobster species. Among sites inside reserves, there was a positive relationship between mortality and proximity to reserve borders, but this relationship was absent among sites outside reserves. Mortality estimates were much more variable among sites inside reserves than at sites in fished areas. Results of YPR models suggest that increased effort in this fishery will not result in commensurate increases in yield. However, current spawning potential at SBCI is _20% (of virgin conditions), and this could decrease with increased effort. Our collaborative framework provides a stable and inclusive framework for conducting future research that informs management of this fishery and fosters stakeholder support.",Santa Barbara,,
1730,Marine Reserves and the Management of Small-Scale Fisheries,"The use of marine reserves throughout the world's oceans is gaining prominence as a fisheries management tool, but the full potential for their use in management is unrealized. Here, I developed a collaborative fisheries research program and designed a series of management models to evaluate the use of marine reserves in the management of small-scale, data-limited fisheries. Biological sampling of grass rockfish (Sebastes rastrelliger) populations was conducted inside and outside of marine reserves in the Santa Barbara Channel, CA, USA. Model fits to the data demonstrated geographic differences in growth, reproductive maturity and length frequency distributions in two environmentally distinct regions of the channel. A simulation model was developed to test the use of bounded catch curve models to estimate natural and fishing mortality rates using biological data from inside and outside of marine reserves. The models were shown to be robust across life history strategies, variable fishing mortality rates, and stochastic recruitment. These models were applied to collaborative research data on grass rockfish to estimate fishery relevant metrics and the status of the resource in the Santa Barbara Channel. Results indicated that populations in the high and low productivity regions of the channel are undergoing overfishing. The incorporation of marine reserves into these management models reduced the probability of overfishing to minimal levels in the high productivity region, but did not reduce the probability of overfishing to acceptable levels in the low productivity region. A management strategy for using marine reserves to set sustainable catch levels was developed for small-scale, data-poor fisheries. The marine reserve-based decision tree uses length frequency and catch per unit effort data from scientific sampling inside and outside of marine reserves to modify allowable catches on an annual basis to achieve target reference points of fisheries management. Management strategy evaluation (MSE) was performed to demonstrate the utility of this model. Over a 30 year time period, simulation results demonstrated that the use of the reserve-based decision tree consistently achieved higher yields than the current precautionary approach to management while meeting conservation targets.",Santa Barbara,,
64,Agribusiness and Mexican Farm Worker Families in Washington State (1964-2013),"Picking up on the Mexican experience in the Pacific Northwest at the end of the Bracero program which has been narrated by Erasmo Gamboa (2000) and more recently by Mario Jimenez Sifuentez (2016), Madrigal uses oral history interviews, ethnography, family history, archival and government data to narrate the experience of Mexican farmworkers in Washington State from 1964 to 2013. This dissertation picks up an old academic (marxian) conversation about problem for capitalist enterprises of the ""limits of capitalist agriculture"" and reinvigorates the conversation by including a historical narrative that centers workers and their contributions towards changing the agricultural industry in Washington via consistent refusal, movement, strikes, and boycotts as well as extending the struggle over the places that Mexicans settled and against deportation and racial profiling. Madrigal uses this systematically collected data on the trends of two of the state's largest agricultural corporate enterprises, this dissertation documents that Broetje Orchards broke a United Farm Workers of Washington strike in the mid 1990s and the other, Sakuma Brothers Farm, was unable to break a strike campaign that began 2013 when Familias Unidas por la Justicia, a democratic idependent farmworker union was formed and began a campaign for a union contract. This study demonstrates that when the geography of struggle is extended over the larger capitalist market circuit of the Pacific Rim and rather than focus on a temporal moment for Mexican workers, we can see that collectively the workers have been prevailing in the long run. This runs contrary to the dominant narrative that farm workers are docile or do not want unions that represent their interests collectively against even larger multi-national enterprises that source the products of their labor from their employers. This dissertation strives to be a tool in the hands of the farmworkers who shared their life histories and experiences. In as much, it presents a map of the history and modes of production of their employers and organizes it in a manner that might be as useful for future struggles as Marcos F. Lopez UC Santa Cruz dissertation ""Places in Production: Nature, Farm Work and Farm Worker Resistance in U.S. and Mexican Strawberry Growing Regions"" (2011) on Driscoll's that narrated many of the same experiences that the farmworkers engaged in this dissertation and later provided the common ground that made relationships between Familias Unidas por la Justicia and the Allianza de Organizaciones Nacional, Estatal y Municipal por la Justicia Social a sister democrative independent farm worker union in Baja California even stronger. Even the reluctantly supportive Seth Holmes' second chapter in ""Fresh Fruit, Broken Bodies: Migrant Farmworkers in the United States"" (2013) which overlaps in documenting some of the same farmworkers that helped draft this study (FUJ member Carmen Juarez is featured on the cover of his book), helped form a campaign that helped defeat Sakuma Brothers Farm which is the subject of his and this study. It is for this reason that the growers and multi-national enterprises that source from them are named as it makes the matter of cross referencing in the future easier for union researchers.",Santa Cruz,,
214,"The Hillslope Signature of Knickpoints Resulting from Stream Capture, Coastal Processes, and Resistant Bedrock on Santa Cruz Island, CA: Insights from an Automated Knickpoint-Selection Algorithm","Oversteepened, convex segments of stream channels called knickpoints have been utilized as markers that commonly migrate upstream and delineate abrupt changes in erosional efficiency influenced by base-level fall, changes in rock strength, or strong spatial variations in discharge. Currently, few analyses based on DEMs enable discrimination among migrating knickpoints related to changes in external forcing (baselevel fall, stream capture, and climate) versus fixed knickpoints related to internal forcing within a catchment (resistant bedrock units, coarse debris flow run-outs at tributary junctions, or landslide dams). Furthermore, few analyses have characterized the extent that migratory knickpoints steepen downstream-adjacent hillslopes. To study these interactions, we exploit a 1-m resolution LiDAR DEM of Santa Cruz Island (SCI), CA and a new algorithm that automatically extracts and measures the dimensions of any knickpoint in a regional DEM. The algorithm reduces knickpoint selection time by >99% and removes selection bias from the traditional means of regional knickpoint identification that relies on visual inspections of individual longitudinal profiles. The spatial pattern of knickpoints located by the algorithm highlight three dominant knickpoint-forming processes on SCI: knickpoints fixed to contacts between rocks of different strength, knickpoints migrating upstream from an incision pulse caused by a significant stream capture event, and mobile knickpoints stemming from relative sea-level fall and wave erosion of sea-cliffs. Nearly 36% of the hillslope area downstream from migratory knickpoints has slopes above threshold values of 35, and on average, these regions display a 4-6 steeper median hillslope-gradient than hillslopes upstream from migratory knickpoints. Hillslope-gradient histograms are nearly identical upstream and downstream from knickpoints fixed to spatial changes in rock strength or when re-analyzing hillslopes surrounding migratory knickpoints with a 10-m resolution DEM. From regionally extensive map of stream knickpoints, geological context, and hillslope attributes extracted from a 1-m resolution DEM, new insights emerge on the controls of landscape evolution; insights that would be much harder to obtain through individual knickpoint selection or lower resolution imagery.",Santa Cruz,,
295,"Ancient Plant Use and the Importance of Geophytes among the Island Chumash of Santa Cruz Island, California","Ancient plant use among the Island Chumash is much less well understood than other aspects of islander lifeways. There is a long history of research on faunal assemblages from Island Chumash sites, whereas comparatively little paleoethnobotanical research has been done. The resulting disparity in faunal vs. floral data combined with field observations of an island landscape ravaged by historical overgrazing, led various researchers to suggest that island plant foods were too marginal to support island populations and that mainland plant foods, subsequently, may have been a major motivating factor behind cross-channel exchange networks and increased sociopolitical complexity seen later in time. Within the context of optimal foraging theory and diet breadth models, I explore the significance of plant foods to the Island Chumash of Santa Cruz Island, using archaeological and paleoethnobotanical data from three sites with bedrock mortars, located in upland and interior areas. These non-coastal sites occur in some of the most productive terrestrial areas on the island, representing a range of time periods and site types: a logistical encampment (Sunburst -- AD 1260-1500); an interior residence (Brodiaea Ridge, 4330 BC-AD 1630); and, a village (Diablo Valdez, 3920 BC-AD 1800). Deep, well-stratified deposits and excellent preservation of domestic features (i.e., roasting pits, hearth clearing pits, structural floor) at Diablo Valdez provide a high-resolution record of archaeological and paleoethnobotanical remains, where I was unable to identify any significant change in plant food subsistence for nearly 6,000 years. Brodiaea corms were the most ubiquitous taxon identified at this site, sometimes occurring in great abundance and associated with large roasting pit features. Here, I argue that carbohydrate content, rather than caloric value, may be a more appropriate currency for ranking plant foods in island contexts, where abundant marine resources provided ample fats and protein. In this scheme, the ranking of plant foods on the northern Channel Islands, in terms of optimal foraging and island archaeobotanical data (ranked high to low) are: 1) geophytes; 2) kelps and seaweeds; 3) small seeds; 4) fruits, berries, and non-toxic pits; 5) leaves, stems, and stalks; 6) toxic nuts and pits; 7) non-toxic nuts; and, 8) aquatic roots/rhizomes. While there is a preservation bias between these various plant food categories, this general ranking scheme appears to be supported in the island archaeobotanical record. As Channel Island vegetation communities recover form more than a century of overgrazing, it has become clear that the phenomenally abundant geophyte resources that occur on the islands are significantly larger and denser than their mainland counterparts in the absence of gophers, moles, ground squirrels, deer, and other terrestrial herbivores. The brodiaeas are particularly well represented in archaeobotanical assemblages for the islands, used for at least 10,000 years and harvested in multiple seasons. The diversity and unparalleled abundance of island geophyte resources would have provided easily procurable and substantial carbohydrates for the Island Chumash and their ancestors. Combined with the diverse and abundant edible marine plants and algae surrounding the islands, geophytes and other island plants provided the Island Chumash with ample food, medicine, and raw materials that were more abundant and stable than previously assumed.",Santa Cruz,,
459,"Past Small-Scale Ecological and Oceanographic Variability around Santa Cruz Island, California. Implications for Human Foraging on M. californianus Beds during the Late Holocene (2200-500 cal B.P.)","Instead, the factors determining this variation are the intensity of human occupation at the archaeological sites, together with past productivity of M. californianus beds near the human settlements. Differing intensities of human occupation at SCRI-195 and SCRI-496 defined harvesting pressure on M. californianus beds, and the frequency and intensity of upwelling conditions (cooler SST) influenced past productivity of M. californianus during the Late Holocene at each site location. This study reached the conclusion that the factors of site occupation dynamics and upwelling occurrence together influenced human foraging on M. californianus during the Late Holocene around Santa Cruz Island and explain variation in archaeological shellfish assemblages. This study evaluates this proposal through the study of archeological, ecological and stable isotopic data from two shell midden sites, SCRI-195 and SCRI-496, on the coast of Santa Cruz island, both occupied during the Late Holocene (2200-500 cal B.P.). The correlation between changes in abundance and size of M. californianus and past sea surface temperature (SST) through the chronological sequences at each archaeological site was statistically evaluated, regional and local SST records spanning the Late Holocene were compared, and modern data concerning ecological and oceanographic factors affecting M. californianus productivity around Santa Cruz island were used to interpret past natural conditions of this shellfish species. The results of this study show that fluctuation in regional and local past SST does not explain variation in abundance or length of collected M. californianus through the occupation of SCRI-195 and SCRI-496. Archaeologists working on the northern Channel Islands of California have proposed that during the Late Holocene, foraging decisions of the islands' prehistoric occupants were progressively less affected by environmental changes as increasing human exploitation pressure shaped abundance and size of intertidal shellfish species. This proposal, although supported by archaeological data from habitation sites, does not incorporate past small-scale ecological and oceanographic variability around the islands nor the effect of this variability on Mytilus californianus (California mussel), the main intertidal shellfish species exploited through prehistory. Consequently, the lessening influence of environmental conditions on shellfish harvesting during the Late Holocene has not been definitively demonstrated.",Santa Cruz,,
600,"Food & Fertility in Prehistoric California: A Case-study of Risk-Reducing Foraging Behavior and Population Growth from Santa Cruz Island, California","The outcome of this research includes the most complete integrated foodways research ever conducted along the central coast of California. The integration of a multiscalar chronological framework and multiple lines of subsistence data provides a unique methodological approach for investigating the role of seasonal subsistence stability in population regulation. Each line of evidence helps in unraveling a complex story of human occupation and foraging behavior at three archaeological sites that I excavated. A thorough and rigorous program of radiometric dating and Bayesian chronological models control the century-level resolution and site seasonality studies based on oxygen isotope analysis the provide seasonal resolution, necessary to infer diachronic shifts in mobility patterns. I also rely on and highlight the importance of analyzing and integrating both faunal and macrobotanical data in order to answer questions of resource exploitation and dietary sufficiency. Together these diverse lines of mobility and subsistence data allow me to reconstruct significant diachronic changes in foraging behavior and evaluate these changes with respect to evidence of climate-induced environmental change and prehistoric population growth. These results suggest that prehistoric human population growth did not always instigate major shifts in food acquisition, but rather was, in some cases, a product of subtle changes in the type, quantity, and quality of food resources upon which human foragers relied. Although this research specifically evaluates dietary and foraging behaviors on Santa Cruz Island, the broad theoretical perspective that macro-scale population level shifts among hunter-gatherers may be an unintended outcome of subtle shifts in foraging behavior---related to a variety of social, environmental, or economic variables---that inform dynamic biological processes is widely applicable to hunter-gatherer studies. Ultimately, this research sheds new light on how significant demographic shifts occurred throughout human history, prior to the adoption of domesticated foods. This archaeological dissertation research project integrates a rigorous chronological framework, geochemical data, and subsistence data to evaluate dynamic interrelationships between foodways, the environment, and human population growth in prehistory. Specifically, this case study elucidates temporal variation in risk-reducing foraging behaviors relative to a period of significant and intrinsic population growth ca. 1600 cal B.P. on the Northern Channel Islands of California. I integrate the energetic focus of reproductive ecology with a behavioral ecological perspective to provide a unique framework for understanding prehistoric demographic shifts within foraging populations.",Santa Cruz,,
1603,"Behavioral Adaptations and Mobility of Early Holocene Hunter-Gatherers, Santa Cruz Island, California","Considering arguments that the unique ecological conditions that exist in maritime environments encouraged reduced residential mobility and hastened the development of socially and politically complex hunter-gatherer societies examination of the development of settlement and foraging organization can help clarify our understanding of social and cultural evolution in maritime contexts. The Northern Channel Islands of California consist of four landmasses with relatively profound environmental variation and are therefore well positioned to evaluate mobility in a maritime context. While previous mobility hypotheses have been formed for the Early Holocene (7500-10,000 BP) on the Northern Channel Islands, these hypotheses included minimal data from Santa Cruz Island, the largest and most environmentally diverse landmass within the Northern Channel Island chain. Yet, data from this island are important because the Northern Channel Islands vary in size, environment, and biodiversity. These differences can have a profound effect on foraging and mobility. This is an important issue within anthropology, as generalization of adaptive behavior does not account for local variants that can play a crucial role in cultural development. To evaluate the nature of mobility during the Early Holocene on Santa Cruz Island resource exploitation, land use, seasonality, and intensity of occupation were examined through artifactual, faunal, and floral data collected during excavations at the five known Early Holocene deposits on Santa Cruz Island. Analyses based on these data included density and diversity analyses of all material, dietary reconstruction using meat weight measures, lithic analysis using size grade ratios, archaeobotanical analysis, oxygen isotope analysis, radiocarbon dating, and various other quantitative measures that were used in both intra- and inter-sites comparisons. Interpretations of these analyses argue that subsistence and settlement decisions were based on locally available resources and the Early Holocene hunter-gatherers on Santa Cruz Island utilized a residentially mobile settlement strategy. The more complex, logistically organized settlement systems of later time periods probably had not yet developed by the end of the Early Holocene on Santa Cruz Island.",Santa Cruz,,
429,Tectonic Geomorphology of the Gaviota Coast,"The Southern Branch of the Santa Ynez Fault (SBSYF) is a major branch of the Santa Ynez Fault that has poorly constrained behavior and may represent significant seismic hazard. Emergent marine terraces appear continuous along the Gaviota Coast, yet this is incompatible with numerical dates from first-emergent marine terraces on the eastern extent (MIS 3) and western extent (MIS 5a) of the Gaviota Coast. This research tests hypotheses to explain where uplift changes across the Gaviota Coast. Normalized stream steepness indices (ksn) of major channels west of the SBSYF (~46) are close to half of those east of the SBSYF (~78). A Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test on ksn values from either side of the SBSYF rejects the null hypothesis of no statistical difference at the 99% level. Additionally, the SBSYF corresponds to an abrupt eastward increase (~350m) in mountain crest elevation and the only water gap that crosses the western Santa Ynez Mountains. A beach exposure of the SBSYF reveals a ~4 m thick fault gauge dipping ~76 to the south and an abrupt 1-2 m increase in modern marine platform elevation east of the fault. I conclude that the SBSYF likely represents a significant and active tectonic boundary that separates two distinct segments of the Gaviota Coast and is a significantly greater hazard than suggested in the published literature.",Santa Ynez,,
300,Equality in the Shadows: Uncovering the Utopian Dimension of Palestinian Film and Media,"How does hope emerge amidst a hopeless situation, freedom amidst apartheid, equality amidst inequality? In the context of Palestine, where is utopian located? A possible answer to these enigmas presented itself in a Freedom March organized by a group of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron in March 2013. Carrying Palestinian flags, they crossed into a forbidden zone, boldly walking into the section of the street designated for Jewish settlers only. On their faces were masks of Martin Luther King, Jr., in their hands were portraits of Rosa Parks, and on their shirts were four English words: ""I have a dream"". By resurrecting the imagery and iconography of the US Black Freedom Movement, these Palestinians were drawing new, imaginative constellations of counterhegemonic protest and forging transnational links of solidarity across time and space. The demonstrators thus staged a disruption. They temporarily interrupted the status quo and transgressed the rules and regulations of the hegemonic order. As a result, they were swiftly apprehended by uniformed members of the Israeli Defense Forces. As if to reenact a scene from Birmingham or Selma, the soldiers ripped the flags from the protesters' hands and placed them in handcuffs. With MLK masks still on their faces, the demonstrators were loaded onto trucks and quickly taken out of sight. The protest was thus brought to a halt almost as soon as it had begun. In this way, an attempt was made to contain the disruption, to restore the ruling regime of hierarchy and segregation, and to sew up the tear that the demonstrators had ripped in the symbolic universe. But while the protesters themselves could be forcibly removed from the scene, the images they left behind could not be so easily erased. Photographs of the demonstration were immediately published on the Internet and circulated on social media websites. Like apparitions from another dimension, these images demonstrate that another world is possible, a world without ethnic- or religious-determined divisions, a world without apartheid walls, security fences, or segregated streets. They show that the unthinkable can be made thinkable, that the invisible can be made visible, and that the impossible can be made possible. This staged news spectacle represents just one example of a larger trend. In Equality in the Shadows, I look at the role of film, media, and culture in the Palestinian struggle against Zionist colonization. Basing my dissertation on both Edward Said's notion of ""the Palestinian Idea"" and Jacques Ranciere's subversive redefinition of equality, I aim to show how through film and media, Palestinian liberation is not only a dream for a far-off and distant future but something that already exists in the present. While my dissertation has a strong foundation in film and media studies, I am drawing on a range of approaches, and I believe my work is relevant to scholars in a variety of disciplines including Black studies, cultural studies, global studies, Middle Eastern studies, politics, and sociology. Each chapter utilizes the work of several critical theorists, and I am attempting to put Palestinian media in conversation with writers such as Ernst Bloch, James Cone, Joan Copjec, Sigmund Freud, Stuart Hall, Dick Hebdige, C.L.R. James, Ghassan Kanafani, Robin D.G. Kelley, George Lipsitz, Catherine Malabou, Herbert Marcuse, and Slavoj Zizek.",Selma,,
777,"A paleomagnetic investigation of vertical-axis rotations in coastal Sonora, Mexico: Evidence for distributed transtensional deformation during the Proto-Gulf shift from a subduction-dominated to transform-dominated plate boundary in the Gulf of California","The history of late Miocene (Proto-Gulf) deformation on the Sonoran margin of the Gulf of California is key to understanding how Baja California was captured by the Pacific plate and how strain was partitioned during the Proto-Gulf period (12.5-6 Ma). The Sierra el Aguaje and Sierra Tinajas del Carmen are located in southwestern coastal Sonora, Mexico, and represent the eastern rifted margin of the central Gulf of California. The ranges are composed of volcanic units and their corresponding volcaniclastic units which are the result of persistent magmatic activity between 20 and 8.8 Ma, including three packages of basalt and andesite that make excellent paleomagnetic recorders. Based on cross cutting relations and geochronologic data for pre-, syn-, and post-tectonic volcanic units, most of the faulting and tilting in the Sierra El Aguaje is bracketed between 11.9 and 9.0 Ma, thus falling entirely within Proto-Gulf time. A paleomagnetic investigation into possible vertical axis rotations in the Sierra el Aguaje has uncovered evidence of clockwise rotations between ~13_ and ~105_ with possible translations. These results are consistent with existing field relations, which suggest the presence of large (>45) vertical axis rotations in this region. This evidence includes: a) abrupt changes in the strike of tilted strata in different parts of the range, including large domains characterized by E-W strikes b) ubiquitous NE-SW striking faults with left lateral-normal oblique slip, that terminate against major NW-trending right lateral faults, and c) obliquity between the general strike of tilted strata and the strike of faults. These rotations occurred after 12 Ma and largely prior to 9 Ma, thus falling into the Proto-Gulf period. Such large-scale rotations lend credence to the theory that the area inboard of Baja California was experiencing transtension during the Proto-Gulf period, rather than the pure extension that would be the result of strain partitioning between Sonora and the Tosco-Abreojos fault offshore Baja California.",Sonora,,
1587,"Race and the Western Frontier: Colonizing the Imperial Valley, 1900--1948","This study uncovers the roots of racism in the Southwest during the first half of the twentieth century and explores how racism affected people of color. It does so by examining connections between racism during the twentieth century and the historical and ideological legacy of Westward expansion. Frontier mores, such as violence, individualism, masculinity, and landownership, that justified Indian removal in the United States during the nineteenth century continued to inform racial prejudice in the Southwest well into the twentieth century. In the context of racial prejudice, this dissertation examines the experiences of people of color who lived, worked, and farmed in Imperial Valley, California. It delves into the complexities of race relations and racial prejudices within a multiplicity of racial groups in the Valley. In doing so, this study goes beyond the Black-white and Mexican-white binaries and investigates racism in the context of a pattern of ethnic and racial succession that included Yuma Indians, Japanese, Punjabis, Mexicans, Filipinos, and white Dust Bowl migrants. Within this multiethnic approach, it emphasizes the contributions of Yuma Indians during the beginnings of industrialized agriculture in the Valley and examines their experiences alongside those of Mexicans and whites. Moreover, this dissertation develops a new perspective on race relations by addressing the conflicts people of color experiences within their own ethnic and/or racial group, in particular, the turmoil that existed within the Japanese and Punjabi communities. They confronted racial prejudice in the larger white community while grappling with dysfunction within their respective racial and/or ethnic group. This study probes the strikes that swept the Valley during the Great Depression and asks how the values which emerged during the expansion of the West informed the violent practices and rhetoric large growers employed. Finally, this work addresses how frontierism promoted white supremacy during World War II as white citizens blamed interethnic violence, racial tensions, and poor moral values on the proximity of the U.S.-Mexico border. The border took on a deeply racialized meaning in the Valley as whites upheld the hierarchal and unequal power dynamic which harkened back to the arrival of the first colonists.",Yuma,,
1,Complex short-time and small-scale behavior of fluid interfaces : A few case studies,"In this work, several case studies involving complex short-time and small-scale behavior of fluid interfaces are presented. The case studies themselves are essentially unique --- involving various forces and effects (mechanical, chemical, electromagnetic, and thermal), and requiring different experimental techniques in order to elucidate the nature of the phenomena and to address the open questions. Some of the phenomena we explore are familiar to most individuals, for example spilling coffee while walking, the formation of a splash due to the impact of a solid object on a liquid surface, or the bursting of soap films. Others are not, like the behavior of coating flows, or the seemingly self-sustained behavior of micro-scale droplet formation using surfactant gradients. But all share intriguing questions, and interesting answers. This tour through a variety of interfacial phenomena has at its purpose, the goal of answering important open questions. The answers serve to verify existing theoretical predictions, resolve disputes between competing theories, and reveal the nature of previously reported behaviors.",,,

3,"Wings Well Braced with Bone : Ibsen, Gender, and the Norse Sagas","Scholarship on Henrik Ibsen has long noted his extraordinary female characters and has uncovered sources and precedents for them. Although critics recognize the sagas from Norse folklore as the source material for Ibsen's early plays, their lasting influence on the characterizations of men and women in his broader body of work has been overlooked. In fact, the fearsome women of the Norse sagas shaped Ibsen's distintive female characters. His depiction of the saga woman and her chosen man is indelibly stamped with the imprint of the Norwegian nationalism that permeated Norway after its liberation from Denmark in 1814. To the Norwegian National Romantics, the Middle Ages and its literature represented a period of conquest and glory before Norway had to bend its knee to Denmark. I argue that Ibsen's saga women differ from the depiction of ""woman as bearer of civilization"" pervasive in works contemporary to him. This striking depiction of women in the ancient sagas lends itself both to Ibsen's early nationalist aims and his later naturalist dramas, in which the female characters' personal liberation may be read in terms of nationalist allegory. By identifying the saga woman as an iconic ""type"" in Ibsen's early plays like Fru Inger til Osteraad ( Lady Inger of Osteraad, 1857) and Haermaendene paa Helgeland (The Warriors at Helgeland, 1858), it becomes easier to detect the vestiges of this character as embodied in the later Realistic prose plays. Ibsen's Valkyrie-like saga women contain the very essence of the Norwegian people; they guide the men they select towards future action even though they put the men at grave risk. They fight to have a psychological hold over the men they select, both with other women and the men themselves. However, these selected men often falter at their assigned task; when they succeed, it is because the man has attended to higher wisdom offered to him by the saga woman.",,,
4,Consciousness and Resistance in Chicano Barrio Narratives,"Chicano barrios in the U.S. are commonly represented by mainstream media as sites of cultural difference, poverty and delinquency. Prior to the Chicano Movement, barrio communities were relatively invisible in dominant American society. The limited academic literature on barrio communities tended to focus on the social problem of delinquent youth and the barriers to successful cultural assimilation. Similarly, prior to the late 1960s there were very few published literary works that offered authentic self-representations of barrio communities. Nevertheless, when Chicanos seized the tools of representation and established presses that were committed to publishing literature about the Chicano experience written by Chicanos, a wave of literature emerged, including narratives that focused on life in the barrio. In comparison to mainstream representations of the barrio, Chicano barrio narratives offer a deeper understanding of the various forms of political, social and economic displacement that produce poverty and delinquency in barrio communities. In addition to complicating negative stereotypes about the barrio, these narratives demonstrate how Chicano communities resist cultural subordination and challenge social injustice. The recreation and affirmation of a mestizo cultural identity, despite its perceived inferiority by the dominant class and at times at the risk of social and legal repercussions, is one form of internal resistance. Other forms include the development of ideologies such as Chicanismo and Indigenismo, and the use of indigenous spirituality as organic Chicano epistemology. The strategies of resistance represented in barrio narratives are informed by a consciousness that is grounded in a Chicano, or mestizo, worldview. Chicano consciousness, in its various manifestations from creative cultural production and social activism to academic and theoretical investigations, is inherently oppositional. Accordingly, alongside a well established Chicano literary tradition, there exists a tradition of Chicano scholarly research that stands in opposition to ideologies that support a dominant hierarchical social order that subordinates people of color. Together, they represent a counter-discourse that parallels, and often converges with, other contemporary de-colonial and indigenous movements that are taking place on a global platform. In this study, historical, political, and theoretical studies produced by Chicano scholars are engaged in a discussion on the underlying consciousness and strategies of resistance that are represented in barrio narratives. It is my contention that the relative isolation of barrio communities speaks to its social marginalization at the same time that it allows for greater cultural autonomy. After providing a historical context for the emergence of Chicano barrio narratives in the first chapter, three key features in the barrio narratives written by Mario Suarez during the Pre-Chicano period are identified and analyzed in the second chapter. The third and fourth chapters show how nationalist ideologies fueled collective resistance in a selection of barrio poems, plays and essays of the Chicano Movement. Finally, in the fifth chapter, I examine spatial perceptions and oppositional consciousness in relation to the figurative boundary that isolates barrio communities in two coming-of-age barrio novels.",,,
5,Cosmogenic 35S as an Intrinsic Hydrologic Tracer for Young Groundwater in Mountain Basins and Managed Aquifer Recharge Facilities,"The current drought crisis in California highlights the vulnerability of freshwater resources, particularly groundwater reservoirs, which supply up to 60% of California's water during drought years. Understanding the potential impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge and storage is critical as drought periods become more frequent in the state. Groundwater residence times provide insight into groundwater recharge and transport mechanisms and storage capacities. This study developed and evaluated a new intrinsic tracer method to quantify groundwater recharge and transport using the occurrence of the naturally-produced radioisotope sulfur-35 (35S, half-life 87.5 days) in water as dissolved sulfate (35SO4). Improvements made to established analytical techniques expand the analytical range of 35SO4, which broadens the utility of 35SO 4 as a hydrologic tracer. The 35SO4 tracer method was applied to two distinct hydrologic settings: 1) high-elevation Sierra Nevada basins, and 2) low-elevations basins containing managed aquifer recharge (MAR) facilities. In the Sierra Nevada study, the new 35SO4 method was used to empirically constrain annual groundwater recharge in Sagehen Creek Basin (SCB) and Martis Valley Groundwater Basin (MVGB). Compared to relatively high 5SO4 activity in seasonal snowmelt (5.5 +/- 0.3 to 52.9 +/- 3.4 mBq/L), groundwater and surface water consistently yielded low 35SO4 activities resulting in a calculated percent new snowmelt (PNS) of <30%. The consistently low PNS suggests that recent (<1 year old) snowmelt represents only a small fraction of the larger aquifer system. As snowpack continues to decline due to climate change, streamflow and springs may respond in a two phase manner: rapid response in discharge followed by more gradual decreases over decades due to declines in groundwater recharge. The MAR study used 35SO4 to quantify groundwater travel times near MAR operations. MAR sites divert excess surface water, imported water, and reclaimed wastewater into surface-spreading ponds or direct injection wells to replenish groundwater in heavy-usage areas. Identifying groundwater travel times near MAR facilities is critical for determining the fate and transport of potential contaminants, especially for facilities that incorporate a significant portion of reclaimed wastewater. Successful application of the 35SO4 tracer method near MAR sites is dependent on careful characterization of the 35SO4 activity in source waters. Relative to established deliberate tracer experiments, which require extensive field and laboratory effort, the less intensive 35SO 4 technique showed comparable groundwater travel times at two MAR facilities located in southern California. Both the Sierra Nevada and MAR studies demonstrate that 35SO4 is a valuable, yet underutilized tracer in hydrologic studies.",,,
6,Sensor Fusion with Conditional Random Fields,"Visual and multimodal sensors are playing an increasingly important role in applications such as object recognition, activity analysis, agriculture monitoring, autonomous navigation and assisted healthcare. Typical features computed from the raw data/ measurements have significant mutual information that can be exploited towards improving the overall pattern recognition performance. In this dissertation we introduce principled methods to aggregate such information using conditional random field (CRF) models. Our aggregation is built on top of a large number of classifiers working independently on features computed from the raw data. The statistical dependencies among classifier outputs are formulated in a factorized form to characterize each class label. This technique enables the consistent prediction patterns to unfold a stronger discriminative power. In the first part of the presentation we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in combining information from a large number of visual features to improve the classification accuracy. Our experimental results show a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art aggregation methods on diverse image datasets. In the second application, we integrate the proposed CRF-based approach to combine multimodal measurements in a task involving a quadcopter UAV with autonomous path planning to detect and recognize the frontal view of a person. In this scenario, we utilize geographic location, time of day, view angle of the camera, altitude and magnetic heading, in addition to the video data, to estimate the body orientation in real time and automatically maneuver the UAV to maintain the frontal view of a person. We demonstrate that the contextual information implicit in the multimodal measurements can significantly reduce the vision-based computations for such real-time tasks.",,,
7,Tuning Electrostatic Interactions in Confined Soft Matter,"Electrostatic interactions determine the key properties of several materials that promise to enable revolutionary nanotechnologies. For example, the power delivered by ionic liquid-based supercapacitors, and the curing time of bio-inspired surgical adhesives, both hinge on the collective behavior of large ensembles of ions in confined interfaces. However, a comprehensive framework for understanding and influencing electrostatic interactions in highly concentrated electrolytes remains elusive. We address this knowledge gap by using nanoscale force-distance measurements to investigate and tune electrostatic interactions in interfaces containing high ionic densities, with an aim of providing quantitative molecular foundations to guide nanomaterials design. In this dissertation, we first review our extension of the Surface Forces Apparatus technique (SFA) to enable force-distance measurements with in situ electrochemical control (the EC SFA). Next, we discuss how EC SFA experiments were combined with temperature-controlled SFA measurements to demonstrate that the electrostatic screening properties of ionic liquids can be rationalized using mean-field theories by focusing on local excess charge densities, as opposed to explicitly accounting for the distribution of every ion. Finally, we illustrate the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions in governing the adhesive performance of mussel-mimetic peptides and conclude with an analysis of how natural proteins provide molecular themes that may guide the design of biomedical adhesives.",,,
8,Probing forces generated and architectures mediated by Tau on microtubules,"Tau, a developmentally regulated protein localized to the axon of mature neurons, stabilizes axonal microtubules but has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases (""tauopathies"") including Alzheimer's, Pick's, and, more recently, chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Despite its importance in both development and disease, difficulty in understanding Tau is due, in part, to its intrinsically disordered nature; Tau does not assume a secondary structure in solution. However, lack of structure does not imply lack of function, as Tau binds to microtubules, thereby regulating microtubule assembly/stability and affecting inter-microtubule interactions, although the latter remains controversial. Herein, through microscopy and synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering of cell free Tau/microtubule reconstitutions under various conditions, we report on the nature of the Tau structure and Tau-mediated interactions between microtubules. By examining the force-response of Tau-coated paclitaxel-stabilized microtubules by osmotic depletants, we observed that longer isoforms of Tau at high (and physiologically relevant) coverage on microtubules more effectively sterically stabilize microtubules against microtubule bundling. This steric stabilization occurs by the amino-terminal tail of Tau assuming the conformational (and repulsive) properties of a polyelectrolyte brush. Furthermore, the coverage at which this transition into a polyelectrolyte brush occurs gives the first direct measurement of the size of the longer isoforms of Tau (20-23 nm) on microtubule surfaces. To understand the molecular mechanism of Tau-mediated inter-microtubule interactions in dissipative, out-of-equilibrium conditions, we co-polymerized Tau with microtubules in the absence of stabilizing agents (i.e. paclitaxel) and found that Tau mediates microtubule bundles with resultant architectures mimicking fascicles of microtubules found in the axonal initial segment. These bundles confirmed an attractive component to the Tau-mediated microtubule interaction through an aggregate of sub-kBT interactions along the microtubule length heretofore unreported in intrinsically disordered systems. The interaction dependence on microtubule length reconciles previous (unsuccessful) attempts at reconstituting Tau-mediated bundles, as stabilizing agents often promoted more, but shorter, microtubules. These novel biophysical characterizations of Tau on the microtubule surface give insight to the physiological function of Tau inside the neuronal axon and represent possible properties to investigate the role of mutations and post-translational modifications of Tau that lead to neurodegenerative disease.",,,
9,III-Nitride Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers,"Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) have a long history of development in GaAs-based and InP-based systems, however III-nitride VCSELs research is still in its infancy. Yet, over the past several years we have made dramatic improvements in the lasing characteristics of these highly complex devices. Specifically, we have reduced the threshold current density from _100 kA/cm2 to _3 kA/cm2, while simultaneously increasing the output power from _10 muW to _550 muW. These developments have primarily come about by focusing on the aperture design and intracavity contact design for flip-chip dual dielectric DBR III-nitride VCSELs. We have carried out a number of studies developing an Al ion implanted aperture (IIA) and photoelectrochemically etched aperture (PECA), while simultaneously improving the quality of tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) intracavity contacts, and demonstrating the first III-nitride VCSEL with an n-GaN tunnel junction intracavity contact. Beyond these most notable research fronts, we have analyzed numerous other parameters, including epitaxial growth, flip-chip bonding, substrate removal, and more, bringing further improvement to III-nitride VCSEL performance and yield. This thesis aims to give a comprehensive discussion of the relevant underlying concepts for nonpolar VCSELs, while detailing our specific experimental advances. In Section 1, we give an overview of the applications of VCSELs generally, before describing some of the potential applications for III-nitride VCSELs. This is followed by a summary of the different material systems used to fabricate VCSELs, before going into detail on the basic design principles for developing III-nitride VCSELs. In Section 2, we outline the basic process and geometry for fabricating flip-chip nonpolar VCSELs with different aperture and intracavity contact designs. Finally, in Section 3 and 4, we delve into the experimental results achieved in the last several years, beginning with a discussion on the epitaxial growth developments. In Section 4, we discuss the most noteworthy accomplishments related to the nonpolar VCSELs structural design, such as different aperture and intracavity contact developments. Overall, this thesis is focused on the nonpolar VCSEL, however our hope is that many of the underlying insights will be of great use for the III-nitride VCSELs community as a whole. Throughout this report, we have taken great effort to highlight the future research fronts that would advance the field of III-nitride VCSELs generally, with the goal of illuminating the path forward for achieving efficient CW operating III-nitride VCSELs.",,,
10,Building an Optomechanical Interface for Superconducting Qubits,"In this thesis, we describe our efforts to build a transducer device capable of translating quantum information between microwave and optical domains. Our motivation for building such a device is to provide a bus for a quantum computer constructed of superconducting qubits. While this type of qubit holds great promise for building a practical quantum computer, it is fundamentally confined to a cryogenic environment while optical photons are not. In order to build this transducer device, we will build electromechanical resonators out of a piezoelectric material, and then interact its mechanical degrees of freedom with an optical resonator using the optomechanical interaction. We will describe the theoretical underpinnings, practical design and nanofabrication of these devices, as well as characterizing their cryogenic performance. We conclude with a workable proof of concept operated in the classical regime, demonstrating a 10-2 internal 10-4 external) microwave-to-optical photon conversion rate (in amplitude) and a firm understanding of its limitations in a cryogenic environment. We analyze what additional materials and fabrication engineering will be required to realize a fully quantum transducer device.",,,
11,"Co-Optimization of Communication, Motion and Sensing in Mobile Robotic Operations","In recent years, there has been considerable interest in wireless sensor networks and networked robotic systems. In order to achieve the full potential of such systems, integrative approaches that design the communication, navigation and sensing aspects of the systems simultaneously are needed. However, most of the existing work in the control and robotic communities uses over-simplified disk models or path-loss-only models to characterize the communication in the network, while most of the work in networking. and communication communities does not fully explore the benefits of motion. This dissertation thus focuses on co-optimizing these three aspects simultaneously in realistic communication environments that experience path loss, shadowing and multi-path fading. We show how to integrate the probabilistic channel prediction framework, which allows the robots to predict the channel quality at unvisited locations, into the co-optimization design. In particular, we consider four different scenarios: 1) robotic router. formation, 2) communication and motion energy co-optimization along a pre-defined trajectory, 3) communication and motion energy co-optimization with trajectory planning, and 4) clustering and path planning strategies for robotic data collection. Our theoretical, simulation and experimental results show that the proposed framework considerably outperforms the cases where the communication, motion and sensing aspects of the system are optimized separately, indicating the necessity of co-optimization. They further. show the significant benefits of using realistic channel models, as compared to the case of using over-simplified disk models.",,,
12,Novice Principals' Views of Instructional Leadership and Organizational Improvement : Two Case Studies,"Recently, researchers and policymakers have been calling on principal preparation programs to equip prospective leaders with education and training in effective instructional leadership practices as well as in school improvement strategies (Grossman, 2011; Leithwood, Louis, Anderson, & Wahlstrom, 2004; The Wallace Foundation, 2009). Kellar and Slayton's (2013) and Martinez-Kellar's (2012) review of the historical progression of school leadership studies identified a transition from a concern with leadership effects on schools (often examined through a quantitative framework) to a concern with the psychological and organizational dimensions of leading people in an organizational context. Martinez-Kellar's (2012) case study of two high school principals indicated that high leader self-efficacy interacted with mental models to foster conditions to promote organizational improvement. The purpose of the current study was to explore two new elementary principals' views of instructional leadership (including possible tensions between evaluation and supervision) as well as views of their roles to facilitate organizational improvement in low-performing schools. Principal interviews were semi-structured, and following the lead of earlier research (Kellar & Slayton, 2013), focused on the conditions/ability new principals believed were important for organizational improvement. Data collection also included two teacher interviews from each site, district and site documentation, and site walkthroughs with each principal. Case descriptions were constructed examining the organizational setting and principal perspectives on instructional leadership and organizational improvement using the conceptual framework guiding the study.",,,
13,"Writing Modernity : Constructing a History of Chinese Architecture, 1920 - 1949","This dissertation joins the contemporary debate on rewriting the history of Chinese architecture by critically (re-)examining the initial stage of discourse formation during the Republican period. Focusing on the ordinary house in the city, I excavate the popular voice on Chinese architecture from the newspapers and magazines, examine the municipal government's effort in modernizing the city and life, as well as the professional community's attempt to establish the authoritative figure of the modern architect to replace that of the traditional craftsman. I show that these different constituencies of Chinese architecture articulated and presented a more vibrant and complex scene of discourse and practice than we have recognized until now. Although each held different forms of power, and focused on different issues, these early interpreters of Chinese architecture nevertheless converged on their understanding of reforming the Chinese house and Chinese architecture. The municipal government's modernizing projects in the city served to bolster the professional community's claim to expertise that culminated in writing a new history of Chinese architecture. This history subsequently became the standard historiography, suppressing and subsuming the popular voice and relegating it to history's dustbin for decades. By retrieving the popular discourse of Chinese architecture from this period, we not only gain a fuller understanding of the formative stage of Chinese architectural historiography, but are also provided with helpful indications pointing to a possible route to rewrite the history of Chinese architecture. Key words: architectural history, Chinese architecture, historiography, popular discourse, modernity in China, modern China.",,,
15,"Compilation of deglacial benthic stable carbon isotope data for reconstructing ocean circulation change, terrestrial biosphere change, and 3D visualizations","Quaternary ice age cycles are characterized by fluctuations in atmospheric CO2, global temperature changes, ice volume changes, global vegetation changes, and physical and chemical changes in the ocean, including changes in deep ocean ventilation and circulation patterns. The ocean is the largest carbon reservoir and is likely a sink for atmospheric CO2 during glacials, but no one hypothesis can account for all the observed CO2 changes. A better understanding of global mean delta13C changes through time can help constrain the roles of vegetation and circulation changes on atmospheric CO2. By amassing a benthic delta 13C dataset covering as many glacial cycles as geologic and coring constraints allow, we can systematically improve estimates of global mean delta 13C, water mass boundary movements, deep ocean carbon storage changes, and past changes in ocean circulation. Additionally, deglacial ventilation of respired carbon represents an important feedback in the climate system that impacts the carbon cycle, global temperatures, sea level, etc. Therefore, reconstructing deglacial changes in benthic delta13C can improve estimates of changes in deep ocean carbon storage and the global carbon cycle. At the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 23-19 ka), most of the carbon released by the terrestrial biosphere was stored in the ocean, where the light isotopic signature of terrestrial carbon is observed as a 0.32--0.7 depletion in mean benthic foraminiferal delta13C values relative to the Late Holocene (6--0 ka). We present a more precise estimate of glacial-interglacial delta 13C change of marine dissolved inorganic carbon using benthic Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi delta13C records from 480 core sites (more than 3 times as many sites as previous studies) from 0.5-5 km depth which yields a mean delta13C decrease of 0.38 +/- 0.08 (2?). Estimating large uncertainty ranges for delta13C change in the top 0.5 km, below 5 km, and in the Southern Ocean, we calculate a whole-ocean change of 0.34 +/- 0.19. This implies a terrestrial carbon change that is consistent with recent vegetation model estimates of 330--694 Gt C. Additionally, we find that a well-constrained surface ocean delta 13C change is essential for narrowing the uncertainty range of estimated whole-ocean delta13C change. Here we estimate the mean ocean delta13C in 1-kyr time steps across the deglaciation (20-6 ka) by placing 118 benthic delta 13C records on regional age models, and averaging these nine regional delta 13C stacks. Additionally we volume-weight intermediate and deep delta 13C stacks, and a global ocean (0.75-5 km) mean delta13C stack. We perform empirical orthogonal function (EOF) on 118 benthic delta 13C records to identify the principle modes of variability in benthic delta 13C. We find the first component of the EOF explains 39% of the variance in benthic delta13C, and describes the long-term deglacial trend in the reduction in deep ocean carbon storage related to the deglacial increase in atmospheric CO2. The second component in benthic delta 13C explains 20% of the variance, and resembles proxies of changes in the strength of North Atlantic deep water formed and millennial scale (1000's of years) variability in North Atlantic iceberg calving event-sourced fresh water. This suggests a fifth of the variability in benthic delta 13C is due to rapid changes in the formation of deep water in the North Atlantic. A simulated mixing experiment with Atlantic delta 13C records from deep water formation regions indicates that the secondary signal in benthic delta13C is most consistent with a millennial-scale reduction in percent North Atlantic Deep Water at 2-4 km in the North Atlantic. Similar to PC1, the volume-weighted Deep delta13C stack minus Intermediate delta13C stack tracks deep ocean carbon storage and covaries with atmospheric fn. Our volume-weighted global mean delta 13C stack suggests the terrestrial biosphere expanded from 19-6 ka while atmospheric CO2 reached its interglacial value around 8 ka. This 4D delta13C data set is suitable for model-data comparisons and time-stepping 3D visualizations. Can 3D visualizations improve undergraduate students' understanding of fundamental Earth science concepts like plate tectonics? Our simple 3D Atlantic seafloor movie helps non-STEM students more than STEM students understand what the seafloor looks like and how ocean basins are formed. Simple 3D visualizations potentially benefit novice science students and closes the gap between STEM and non-STEM students' scores.",,,
16,"Guca : An Account of the Phonetics, Phonotactics, and Lexical Suffixes of a Kwak'wala Dialect","The topic of this dissertation is Guca, a dialect of Kwak' wala, an endangered Wakashan language that is spoken on the northern end of Vancouver Island, British Columbia and the adjacent mainland. This study is based on a corpus of elicited and naturalistic language recordings made in the home of the Wallas family of Quatsino between 2011 and 2014. The study contributes to the documentation of this little-studied dialect by describing, in Chapter 2, the phoneme inventory and the phonetic character of the segments as well as common phonological processes in this variety of the language. In addition, the phonotactics of the language are documented and investigated with regards to their potential phonetic bases in Chapter 3. The typologically unusual lexical stress system displays a ""default-to-right"" pattern, whereby the leftmost heavy syllable in the word is stressed, but if none are heavy, the rightmost is stressed. The weight distinctions employed by the language shed light on our understanding of sonority and are interesting because while resonants increase a syllable's sonority and weight, glottalization of a coda consonant reduces a syllable's sonority and weight. The investigation of the acoustics of stress and of syllable weight in Guca indicate that glottalization reduces the duration and pitch of vowels followed by glottal coda consonants, and that these parameters correlate with syllable weight in this language. Chapter 4 investigates the current status and use of the lexical suffixes, an important morphophonological and grammatical structure in Guca. Semantically, these derivational suffixes often resemble roots, and they induce phonetic changes on the stems they attach to, which are not part of the regular phonological processes of the language. Because of their structural dissimilarity to grammatical structures in the dominant English language, they are perhaps prone to early loss in the context of language endangerment. However, this study finds that they are still robustly in use by speakers and that they do not show signs of phonological weakening. The language is used primarily as a family code, but is also in use for cultural action and traditions, especially by the youngest speaker. This study contributes to the phonetic, phonological, morphological, and contextual understanding of a highly endangered dialect.",,,
17,Family Values at Work : Social Movements and the Politics of Leave Legislation in the U.S,"The United States lags behind most other nations in the world with respect to job-protected leave and paid leave from work, such as parental leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 is the only federal leave policy, and it provides 12 weeks of job-protected leave for personal care or family care to address serious illnesses or health conditions. However, leave under the FMLA is unpaid, and restrictive eligibility requirements prohibit over 40 percent of the workforce from taking advantage of its provisions. Given the FMLA's shortcomings, states have passed their own leave laws, offering paid leave, covering more workers, lengthening leave durations, or expanding definitions of ""family"" for the purposes of family caregiving leave. My dissertation applies both quantitative and qualitative analytical approaches to explore relationships between social movements and gender-neutral leave legislation (i.e., paid and/or job-protected family, parental, and sick leave) in U.S. states. It addresses two key questions: First, how and to what extent do union-community coalitions (or social movements) influence state leave legislation? Second, under what conditions do they have influence? (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.).",,,
18,Mining Disparate Sources for Question Answering,"Today's paradigm of information search is in the midst of a significant transformation. Question answering (QA) techniques that can directly and precisely answer user questions are becoming more and more desired, in contrast to traditional search engines retrieving lengthy web pages. The big data age is endowed with large-scale diversified information sources, such as structured knowledge bases (KBs), unstructured texts, semi-structured tables, as well as human networks including social and expert networks. How to mine such large-scale and disparate sources to advance question answering? In this dissertation, we systematically investigate this problem from the perspectives of text mining, network analysis and human behavior understanding. Specifically, our research lies in: (1) Text-based question answering. We recognize that KBs are usually far from complete and information required to answer questions may not always exist in KBs. This framework jointly utilizes web texts and knowledge bases: It mines answers directly from large-scale web corpora, and meanwhile employs KBs as a significant auxiliary to boost QA performance. (2) Table-based question answering. Owing to their prevalence on the Web and large topical diversity, we explore tables, which are distinctive from KBs and texts, for question answering. Specifically, we investigate the problem of given millions of tables, how to precisely retrieve table cells to answer a user question. We propose a table cell search framework to deal with it. The framework is compared with state-of-the-art KB-based QA systems. Experimental results validate the hypothesis that web tables provide rich knowledge missing from existing KBs, and thus serve as a good complement. (3) Expert-based question answering. The intelligence possessed by current machines is still limited in many aspects. Human intelligence, contributed by crowdsourcing platforms and collaborative networks, should be exploited to complement machine-aided question answering and problem solving. We are among the first to quantitatively analyze task/question routing behaviors of experts in real collaborative networks, which aims at detecting the efficiency bottleneck and optimizing human collaboration. The developed methodologies and frameworks in this dissertation hence pave the path for building intelligent systems which can utilize an array of complementary knowledge sources including knowledge bases, texts, tables, and human networks to directly answer user questions in various domains, discover novel knowledge, and thereby assist problem solving and decision making.",,,
19,Physiological Responses to Perceived Exergame Task Demands,"Exercise videogames are increasingly popular as individuals seek to increase daily exercise. This study assessed physiological reactions to perceived task demands from a virtual exercise game and their influence on exercise during the following week. Participants completed a biking task in a virtual environment with an avatar that they were told would slim if they cycled fast enough (low task demand manipulation). Only half of participants' avatars actually slimmed (high task demand manipulation). Individuals with high exercise self-efficacy (ESE) showed similar results in both task demand conditions with high levels of work output and cardiovascular reactivity patterns indicative of threat. However, individuals with low ESE with an avatar that remained constant (high task demand) worked less hard and completed less exercise than those with low ESE who observed their avatar slimming. Results confirm that high task demands for those with low ESE levels can be particularly damaging by reducing future exercise levels.",,,
20,The FORUM : aresponse to Paradigm Shift From State to Global Governance Field,"This study is an ethnography of the global. The Forum: A response to Paradigm Shift From State to Global Governance Field is based on what I perceive as an emerging pattern in global governance that is qualitatively different than past realities. The difference is signaled by what I perceive as an evolution of Pierre Bourdieu's theories on the state. Bourdieu's notion of the state field can be extended to the study of a global governance field wherein spheres of the state field have evolved together but at different rates and, at times, with differing objectives. These spheres include traditional governing institutions, the global economic sector, and global civil society. Traditional governance and the global economic sector were the first to begin their evolution from the level of the state to the global. Global civil society has emerged as a third actor within that field of global governance and has begun to act as mediator, and mitigator when needed, to the other actors. The World Economic Forum is one such actor, and one that has gained significant influence within the field of global governance. In 1971 the Forum began with a vision dedicated to bringing a more cooperative model to business based on the idea of multi-stakeholder environments. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Forum had established itself as a leading convener of the world's elite. Bringing together top CEOs from some of the world's most influential corporations with government and social leaders from across the globe, the Forum offered a space for these individuals to converge and discuss the necessary mutuality of their operations within shrinking global space. Controversial for many reasons, the Forum has still risen as convener, broker, knowledge producer and thereby policy generator for these global elite populations. This dissertation derives the majority of its data from an ethnographic study at their headquarter operations in Geneva, Switzerland. Based on 36 interviews with respondents ranging from a college intern to that of the founder and Chairman, as well as participant observation, and internal document analysis, this study seeks to understand how the Forum has evolved its internal culture from its inception and how this evolution has aided in organizational adaption trajectories that keep Forum services relevant to the global community that they serve. This study highlights why we should care about the Forum as an organization in the era of the global.",,,
21,Comparative Optimism About Privacy Risks on Social Network Sites,"Comparatively optimistic people think that they are less susceptible to risks than others, and that sense of invulnerability may lead them to engage in risky behaviors. This study investigated antecedents (perceived control, prior negative privacy experiences by self or others, SNS usage, and privacy concern) and outcomes (information disclosure, use of privacy protection strategies, and profile visibility) of comparative optimism about privacy risks on social networking sites (SNSs). Results from a nationally representative survey of Facebook users in the U.S. show that users are comparatively optimistic, believing that they are less susceptible to privacy risks than are average users. However, unlike prior findings from offline contexts, comparatively optimistic SNS users do not engage in riskier privacy behaviors. This study also sheds light on the concept of users' sense of 'networked privacy,' which is the notion that privacy in networked environments is affected by actions of both self and others (e.g., tagging). Results of this study confirm that on SNSs, users' privacy perceptions are affected by how they perceive their own risk, as well as others' risk of having a negative privacy experience.",,,
22,Ultra-Narrow Bandwidth Optical Resonators for Integrated Low Frequency Noise Lasers,"The development of narrowband resonators has far reaching applications in integrated optics. As a precise reference of wavelength, filters can be used in sensors, metrology, nonlinear optics, microwave photonics, and laser stabilization. In this work, we develop record high quality factor (Q) Si 3N4 waveguide resonators, and utilize them to stabilize a heterogeneously integrated Si/III V laser. To increase the Q factor of waveguide resonators, particular attention is given to loss mechanisms. Propagation loss of <0.1 dB/m is demonstrated on the ultra low loss waveguide platform, a low index contrast, high aspect ratio Si3N4 waveguide geometry fabricated with high quality materials and high temperature anneals. Ideality in the directional couplers used for coupling to the resonators is studied and losses are reduced such that 81 million intrinsic Q factor is achieved. Additional results include 1x16 resonant splitters, low ? narrowband gratings, and a dual layer waveguide technology for low loss and low bend radius in separate regions of the same device layer. We then combine an ultra high Q resonator and a heterogeneous Si/III V laser in a Pound Drever Hall (PDH) frequency stabilization system to yield narrow linewidth characteristics for a stable on chip laser reference. The high frequency noise filtering is performed with Si resonant mirrors in the laser cavity. A 30 million Q factor Si3N4 resonator is used with electrical feedback to reduce close in noise and frequency walk off. The laser shows high frequency noise levels of 60x103 Hz2/Hz corresponding to 160 kHz linewidth, and the low frequency noise is suppressed 33 dB to 103 Hz2/Hz with the PDH system.",,,
23,Vimalamitra : The Legend of an Indian Saint and His Tibetan Emanations,"One of the oldest narratives detailing the birth of the Indian saint Vimalamitra claims he was the son of an unwed virgin, Dharmabodhi, who was so ashamed that her son had no father and that she had no husband, she buried her newborn under a mound of sand. As she prepared to leave the child to die, she wept until she could no longer bear the pain. Fleeing the burial mound in a grief-stricken state, she looked back one last time and noticed that her child's eyes were glowing so brightly they shone straight through the sand. Startled, she ran back to uncover the young Vimalamitra and raised him to become a Buddhist master. Though Vimalamitra's bright eyes motivated his mother to disinter the buried child, the reasons that Tibetans unearthed the name of an eighth-century Indian scholar to rewrite his legacy and attribute texts en masse to him over three hundred years after he departed Tibet are more difficult to adduce. There are good reasons this is the first comprehensive study of one of the most important saints in Tibetan history. Along with being an important figure, Vimalamitra is one of the most confounding saints from the imperial era. Decade after decade, Tibetan Buddhists wrote, re-wrote, and then re-wrote again the life story of the eighth-century Buddhist saint. Century after century, they constructed namtars (rnam thar), a genre in Tibetan literature that is akin to hagiography. Because a Western conception of historical accuracy was not of chief concern to these authors, as the number of Vimalamitra-related namtars increased, so did the conflicting presentations of the biographical details of the Indian saint's life. As a result, there is little that can be said with any degree of certainty regarding the life and teachings of the ""historical"" Vimalamitra. This study elucidates a previously untold textual history of a millennium-long exchange between a quasi-mythical Indian saint and the Tibetan communities who continuously wrote the tantric (esoteric) texts that bore his name. It details the socio-religious history of the Tibetans who imagined and then re-imagined the persona of Vimalamitra to indigenize Buddhist traditions, establish lineal legitimacy, preserve tantric traditions, create community identities, and perhaps even manufacture the miraculous. The broader purpose of the study is to illuminate the role that an ever-changing Vimalamitra-related mythos played in fomenting, legitimating, and solidifying several developments in Tibetan Buddhist doctrine, practice, and politics, which, when analyzed as a collective, provide a previously untold micro-history of the Nyingma lineage (Rnying ma'i brgyud pa). To accomplish these goals, there are five chief questions addressed throughout the five chapters. (1) What can be said, with some degree of certainty, about the historical Vimalamitra? (2) Why was the historical Vimalamitra transformed into a legendary tantrika capable of performing miraculous deeds comparable to those of the Indian mahasiddhas? (3) How did the legend of Vimalamitra become central to Nyingma history, evolving with the Nyingma tantric tradition over the course of more than a millennium? (4) Why did accounts of Tibetans claiming to witness emanations of Vimalamitra mutate to claims that living Tibetan masters were embodied emanations of the saint? (5) Is it possible to critically re-examine the claims made by the dozens of meditators who recorded experiencing a vision of Vimalamitra? To answer these questions, I pieced together the contributions made by previous scholars, while comparing over one hundred and twenty distinct documents and manuscript fragments linked to Vimalamitra from China, India, and Tibet, spanning fourteen hundred years, from multiple genres of literature on topics as diverse as history, biography, refuge vows, sutras, Vinaya, Abhidharma, Madhyamaka, Yogacara, Yoga Tantra, Mahayoga Tantra, and Dzokchen Tantra. To make sense of this vast amount of data, I created a broad theoretical framework, drawing from numerous disciplines, including religious studies, anthropology, political science, sociology, literary studies, and comic books.",,,
24,Modeling and Calibrating the Distributed Camera,"Structure-from-Motion (SfM) is a powerful tool for computing 3D reconstructions from images of a scene and has wide applications in computer vision, scene recognition, and augmented and virtual reality. Standard SfM pipelines make strict assumptions about the capturing devices in order to simplify the process for estimating camera geometry and 3D structure. Specifically, most methods require monocular cameras with known focal length calibration. When considering large-scale SfM from internet photo collections, EXIF calibrations cannot be used reliably. Further, the requirement of single camera systems limits the scalability of SfM. This thesis proposes to remove these constraints by instead considering the collection of cameras as a distributed camera that encapsulates the image and geometric information of all cameras simultaneously. First, I provide full generalizations to the relative camera pose and absolute camera pose problems. These generalizations are more expressive and extend the traditional single-camera problems to distributed cameras, forming the basis for a novel hierarchical SfM pipeline that exhibits state-of-the-art performance on large-scale datasets. Second, I describe two efficient methods for estimating camera focal lengths for the distributed camera when calibration is not available. Finally, I show how removing these constraints enables a simpler, more scalable SfM pipeline that is capable of handling uncalibrated cameras at scale.",,,
25,An Analog Phase Interpolation Based Fractional-N PLL,"A novel phase-locked loop topology is presented. Compared to conventional designs, this architecture aims to increase frequency resolution and reduce quantization noise while maintaining the fractional-N benefits of high bandwidth and low phase noise up-conversion. This is achieved utilizing a feedforward mechanism for offset cancellation from the integer-N frequency. The design is implemented in a 0.13mum CMOS process technology. A frequency resolution of 1.16Hz is achieved on a 5GHz differential delay cell VCO with a 100MHz reference oscillator. A ping-pong swallow counter topology alleviates pipeline latency to achieve 1-64 divide ratios. A digital pulse generator and nested phase-frequency detector provide tunable offset cancellation. A 5-bit current-steering DAC capable of 200ps pulses reduces output spurs. Theoretical calculations and Simulink modeling provides insight to the effects of non idealities in the system. Test structures and loop configurability are programmed via SPI interface through a custom GUI and prototype PCB.",,,
26,Resource Availability Drives Large Differences in the Fine-Scale Spatial Pattern of Parrotfish Herbivory on a Coral Reef,"Herbivory by fishes and sea urchins is a powerful mechanism on coral reefs that mitigates coral-algal competition by physically removing algae and creating bare space. The fine-scale spatial patterning of herbivory has the potential to foster coral recruitment by creating a spatially continuous refuge for coral settlement and survival. The temporal nature of grazing also has the potential to influence competitive outcomes between coral and algae by preventing algal dominance and consistently exposing bare substrate at a particular location. Here we explore the intraspecific variability in the fine-scale feeding behavior of a large, mobile coral reef herbivore on a small, pristine Central Pacific atoll. We document how two different resource regimes appear to drive differences in the social structure and the spatial and temporal feeding behavior of the Steephead Parrotfish, Chlorurus microrhinos. We report that feeding behavior is spatially focused when resources are abundant and regrow quickly, resulting in dense patches of bite scars (>100 bites m-2). There also appears to be a temporal periodicity to feeding behavior when resource are abundant and predictable, although our study duration did not allow for the precise timing between feeding bouts to be detected. We found that movement increases and feeding behavior is distributed sparsely across food patches when resources were scarce and recovered more slowly. The differences we report here occur at sites that are only a few kilometers away from one another, but result in dramatically different impacts to the benthos that could alter the survival of corals at their earliest life stages.",,,

Our ultimate goal is to find appropriate conditions on the initial data and the forcing terms so that global existence and uniqueness of a mild solution is guaranteed. We will use the Picard's iteration method to prove existence of local mild solution and then prove the existence of a maximal solution which then leads to global existence. The result is applied to the backward Kolmogorov-Obukhov energy cascade and the forward Kraichnan enstrophy cascade in 2D turbulence.",,,
29,"Understanding Women's Possible Selves and the Influences on these Selves at a Private, 4-year, Religiously-Affiliated College","While women now outnumber men in college attendance rates, the gender gap in occupations, salary and leadership persists. The purpose of this study was to extend the research on college women's future thinking by exploring the possible selves and the influences on these selves of women at a private 4-year religiously affiliated college. The construct of possible selves has been used to better understand individuals' views of their future thinking (Markus & Nurius, 1986). The investigator conducted three focus groups (15 students) followed by ten individual interviews in spring, 2015. Women were asked to share their future hopes, expectations and fears for the next five years as well as any factors or experiences that significantly influenced their future thinking. Women's gender role beliefs were specifically queried as a possible influence. Three major themes and three unanticipated findings were identified. Anticipated themes included women's lack of leadership aspirations, the role of faith in guiding women's possible selves, and the influential role of family and faculty. Unanticipated findings included women's high achievement expectations, adherence to gender role messages to do it all and do it all well, and the influence of study abroad experiences. These findings offer key insights to college administrators who shape student learning environments to best guide and support female students in thinking about their futures.",,,
30,"The Character, Stability and Consequences of Mn-Ni-Si Precipitates in Irradiated Reactor Pressure Vessel Steels","Formation of a high density of Mn-Ni-Si nanoscale precipitates in irradiated reactor pressure vessel steels could lead to severe, unexpected embrittlement, which may limit the lifetimes of our nation's light water reactors. While the existence of these precipitates was hypothesized over 20 years ago, they are currently not included in embrittlement prediction models used by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This work aims to investigate the mechanisms and variables that control Mn-Ni-Si precipitate (MNSP) formation as well as correlate their formation with hardening and embrittlement. A series of RPV model steels with systematic variations in Cu and Ni contents, two variables that have been shown to have a dominant effect on hardening, were irradiated in a series of test reactor and power reactor surveillance irradiations. Atom probe tomography (APT) measurements show that large volume fractions (fv) of MNSPs form in all the steels irradiated at high fluence, even those containing no added Cu, which were previously believed to have low sensitivity to embrittlement. It is demonstrated that while Cu enhances the rate of MNSP formation, it does not appear to significantly alter their saturation fv or composition. The high fluence MNSPs have compositions consistent with known intermetallic phases in the Mn-Ni-Si system and have fv very near those predicted by equilibrium thermodynamic models. In addition, X-ray diffraction experiments by collaborators shows that these precipitates also have the expected crystal structure of the predicted Mn-Ni-Si phases. Post irradiation annealing experiments are used to measure the hardness recovery at various temperatures as well as to determine if the large f v of MNSPs that form under high fluence neutron irradiation are thermodynamically stable phases or non-equilibrium solute clusters, enhanced or induced by irradiation, respectively. Notably, while post irradiation annealing of a Cu-free, high Ni steel at 425C results in dissolution of most precipitates, a few larger MNSPs appear to remain stable and may begin to coarsen after long times. A cluster dynamics model rationalizes the dissolution and reduction in precipitate number density, since most are less than the critical radius at the annealing temperature and decomposed matrix composition. The stability of larger precipitates suggests that they are an equilibrium phase, consistent with thermodynamic models. Charged particle irradiations using Fe3+ ions are also used to investigate the precipitates which form under irradiation. Two steels irradiated to a dose of 0.2 dpa using both neutrons and ions show precipitates with very similar compositions. The ion irradiation shows a smaller f v, likely due to the much higher dose rate, which has been previously shown to delay precipitation to higher fluences. While the precipitates in the ion irradiated condition are slightly deficient in Mn and enriched in Ni and Si compared to neutron irradiated condition, the overall similarities between the two conditions suggest that ion irradiations can be a very useful tool to study the susceptibility of a given steel to irradiation embrittlement. Finally, the large fv of MNSPs that are shown to form in all steels, including those low in Cu, at high fluence, even those without added Cu, result in large amounts of hardening and embrittlement. A preliminary embrittlement prediction model, which incorporates MNSPs at high fluence, is presented, along with results from a recent test reactor irradiation to fluences representative of extended lifetimes. This model shows very good agreement with the data.",,,
31,Path Planning Algorithms for Robotic Agents,"The focus of this work is path planning algorithms for autonomous agents. Specifically, we study problems in three areas where path planning to direct the motion of autonomous agents is critical for their performance. The first problem is a vehicle routing problem in which mobile demands appear in an environment and the task of the autonomous agent is to stop the demands from escaping the environment boundary. We first propose two fundamental performance bounds for the proposed problem. We then propose routing algorithms for this problem with performance guarantees. We examine the gap between these guarantees and the fundamental performance bounds. The second problem is a surveillance problem in a networked environment. The tasks of the autonomous surveillance agent in this problem are to (1) detect unknown intruder locations and (2) detect anomalies based on noisy measurements. We propose Markov chain based routing algorithms for the surveillance agent to achieve these goals. We parameterize these routing algorithms using a property of Markov chains called the mean first passage time. We also frame optimization problems to obtain optimal algorithms for the two surveillance tasks. The third problem studied in this work is a boundary guarding problem in which the task of a set of patrolling agents constrained to move on a ring is to achieve synchronization using only local communication. We propose a coordination algorithm to solve this problem and identify initial agent configurations under which synchronization is guaranteed.",,,

33,Essays on Factor Reallocation and General Equilibrium Analysis,"My dissertation studies the sectoral and regional reallocation of capital and labor for an economy in transition using general equilibrium model framework. The first chapter, ''Capital in Transition: Housing and Sectoral Reallocation in the Long Run'', studies the sectoral allocation of capital between housing and non-residential sectors using a two-sector general equilibrium model in a neoclassical growth environment. Calibrated to both the United States and China, the model can account for both the positive correlation between the share of housing capital and the consumption-output ratio in the United States and the negative correlation between the share of housing capital and the consumption-output ratio in China. The calibration to the Chinese economy implies that the rapid increase in the share of housing capital and the simultaneous decrease in the consumption-output ratio observed in China can be rationalized by a combination of three factors: a high elasticity of substitution between the two sectors, a high capital intensity of production of the housing sector, and a low initial share of housing capital before the Chinese housing market reform. This paper provides a tractable framework to understand the sectoral allocation of capital between housing and non-residential sectors across countries. The second chapter, ''Human Capital Spillover and Housing price'', provides a model framework to study the relationship between the external effect of human capital and housing price growth in the SEZ economy in China. In a two-region model, high wage in the SEZ region reflects high level of human capital, and these jobs are not available to low human capital migrants from the non-SEZ economy. The migrants come to the SEZ economy for two reasons: on the one hand, the SEZ economy is a better place to accumulate human capital and earn a higher wage in the future; on the other hand, the SEZ economy has a better amenities for living. In the baseline model with migration, the share of population that choose to migrate to the SEZ economy is determined by the utility equalization between living in either economy. In the baseline model, the migration occurs all at once at the first period. Further, I extend the baseline model by incorporating the spillover effect of human capital: time invested in human capital accumulation has a higher return in high human capital environment. In this case, the migration to the SEZ economy becomes increasingly attractive as the gap between the human capital leaders and followers increase. By comparing the extended model with the baseline, I capture the significant positive impact of human capital spillover on the increase of housing prices. The third chapter, ''Dynamic Arrow-Debreu Economy for General Equilibrium Analysis'', coauthored with Cheng-Zhong Qin, develops a dynamic Arrow-Debreu abstract economy to more closely capture the timing of moves of Walrasian general equilibrium model. Instead of inducing a pseudo game, the extensive form of the dynamic Arrow-Debreu abstract economy is well defined. As such, various game-theoretic solutions with and without symmetric information can be applied. We show that the set of subgame-perfect equilibrium allocations coincides with the set of Walrasian equilibrium allocations when information is symmetric. The set of perfect Bayesian equilibrium allocations coincides with the set of rational expectations equilibrium allocations when information is asymmetric. These results are useful for analyzing and refining Walrasian and rational expectations equilibrium allocations.",,,
34,Neural and Facial Correlates of Affective Disposition during Morally-Salient Narratives,"The recent growth of the neurophysiological paradigm has re-defined important concepts in communication. To better understand of how fictional narratives operate at a neurophysiological level, this study employs a combination of fMRI and face-tracking to explore affective disposition theory (ADT), which predicts that viewers' affective responses lead them to prefer narratives in which virtuous characters are rewarded and immoral characters are punished. Previous work has shown that inter-subject correlations (ISC) in brain activity are highest when viewing disposition-consistent narrative outcomes --- specifically, the punishment of immoral characters. The present study partially replicates these findings and also uses psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis to augment the notion that punishment of immoral characters yields discernibly different patterns of brain connectivity than other narrative content. To directly address the affective component of ADT, further PPI analyses compared high- and low-empathy participants. Results indicate that the patterns of co-activation between brain regions revealed through PPI are moderated by trait empathy: seeing good characters rewarded yields the same co-activation patterns among high-empathy individuals as seeing bad characters punished does among low-empathy individuals. To provide another window into affective processing, automated face-tracking is used to evaluate whether greater ISCs in brain activity also yield greater similarities in the time-course of emotive facial expressions. Results indicate that correlations in facial expression vary systematically by experimental condition, but, contrary to the pattern of neuronal ISC, facial expressions exhibit the greatest correlation in disposition-inconsistent conditions. Furthermore, unlike neuronal ISC, correlations in facial expressions are significantly higher among high-empathy participants. In sum, these results support the view that disposition-consistent narrative content drives inter-subject correlation in brain activity, but that shared brain activity does not yield correlated displays of emotion; instead, emotive displays are moderated by empathy and may play a communicative role in expressing dissatisfaction with disposition-inconsistent narratives. The implications of these findings for further research into the affective component of ADT are discussed.",,,
35,"Articulating Space : Geometric Algebra for Parametric Design - Symmetry, Kinematics, and Curvature","To advance the use of geometric algebra in practice, we develop computational methods for parameterizing spatial structures with the conformal model. Three discrete parameterizations -- symmetric, kinematic, and curvilinear -- are employed to generate space groups, linkage mechanisms, and rationalized surfaces. In the process we illustrate techniques that directly benefit from the underlying mathematics, and demonstrate how they might be applied to various scenarios. Each technique engages the versor -- as opposed to matrix -- representation of transformations, which allows for structure-preserving operations on geometric primitives. This covariant methodology facilitates constructive design through geometric reasoning: incidence and movement are expressed in terms of spatial variables such as lines, circles and spheres. In addition to providing a toolset for generating forms and transformations in computer graphics, the resulting expressions could be used in the design and fabrication of machine parts, tensegrity systems, robot manipulators, deployable structures, and freeform architectures. Building upon existing algorithms, these methods participate in the advancement of geometric thinking, developing an intuitive spatial articulation that can be creatively applied across disciplines, ranging from time-based media to mechanical and structural engineering, or reformulated in higher dimensions.",,,
36,MOCVD Growth and Electrical Characterization of AlInGaN Heterojunctions,"III-N-based electronics and optoelectronics are reaching great levels of sophistication in the areas of power electronics, RF amplifiers, lighting, and display technologies. Much of the success of these technologies can be traced to superior or unique material properties that make III-N solid state devices the ideal choices for their applications. Consequently, state of the art devices are being pushed to the limit of what may be fabricated due to strain considerations in the AlGaN and InGaN systems. In order to continue the advancement of III-N based technologies toward greater performance, into new niches, and open up new markets, it is necessary to exploit the entire (Al,In,Ga)N system to its fullest potential. The utility of AlInGaN is multifaceted. These materials can be used for strain management, fabrication of lattice-matched devices, and polarization engineering to manipulate electric fields within device active regions, or even create high-conductivity charge slabs. Unlike ternary alloys, there is no single unique combination of band gap, polarization charge, and lattice constant, which results in greater device design freedom. However, to effectively utilize these materials, reliable growth processes must be established, and the material parameters critical to device design must be characterized. This thesis describes the progress in AlInGaN development at UCSB beginning with identification and exploration of the AlInGaN growth parameter space, using understanding from ternary alloys as a springboard into quaternary growth. From there, the thesis progresses to the establishment of a design toolbox for AlInGaN based devices via electrical characterization of these materials. Challenges associated with the AlInGaN system, coupled with sparse literature on the topic, necessitated the design of experiments to isolate and characterize the material parameters from measurements of solid-state devices. Electrical characterization focused on the net polarization charge at heterojunction interfaces, as well as the effects of Schottky barrier height inhomogeneity on both electrostatics and transport in diodes. The quantum mechanical scattering at the metal-semiconductor junction will be discussed, as will its physical origin and impact on diode current. A major goal of this thesis was to establish a device design toolbox populated with information of experimentally calculated net polarization charge at AlInGaN/GaN interfaces and Schottky barrier heights. This goal was accomplished and the information was established for future device designers in the field. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the application and exploitation of the unique effects observed in AlInGaN materials to device design. Future outlook will be given on avenues for research in AlInGaN materials and AlInGaN-based devices, and direction will be provided to finish populating the (electrical) device design toolbox with conduction band offset measurements.",,,
37,"Education, Foundations, and Transparency : The Role of Philanthropy and Oversight in K-12 Education Reform","This thesis examines the role that major philanthropic foundations play in K-12 education reform and its implications for public school policy and politics in the United States. It begins with an exploration of the existing literature on private foundations and their historical and contemporary involvement in K-12 education reform, noting the primary sources of contention between proponents of increased foundation autonomy and critics that argue for more intensive regulation. The discussion follows this by critically interrogating these arguments and offering an alternative theoretical perspective to approaching oversight for major foundations. This approach deviates from traditional analyses as it does not focus on tax-exempt status as a basis for enhanced oversight but rather on the potential outcomes and risks of foundation grantmaking for public school systems. After laying this theoretical groundwork, the thesis offers a proposal for enhanced transparency and public disclosure for major education foundations, providing a low-cost, politically and technically feasible approach to oversight that builds on existing public and civil society disclosure programs.",,,
38,The Level of Selection and the Adaptive Function of Punishment in Collective Action,"Punishing a non-cooperator in collective action has consequences not only for the punisher, but also for others, and hence may commonly generate externalities. Individual selection theories have focused on the positive effects of punishment that benefit the punisher individually and propose that the adaptive function of punishment is to optimize relative individual fitness within group. On the other hand, group selection theorists argue that the benefitting effect of punishment on the group relative to other groups was more important for the ancestral punishers. For the past several decades, attempts at resolving the debate over the adaptive function and level of selection of punishment have floundered and we have not yet arrived at a consensus resolution. The goal of this dissertation is to propose a solid and powerful paradigm for model selection that helps researchers decide between alternative evolutionary models. The evolutionary principal component approach (E-PCA) combines the statistical principal component approach with the multilevel selection perspective in order to evaluate alternative theories of how selection shaped evolved mechanisms. E-PCA transforms the abstract concept of strength of selection into a displacement of a mutation set over time (or temporal variance), something that can be potentially measured. Then, evolutionary psychology provides an inferential framework for estimating the temporal variance by conceptualizing it as the magnitude of design improvement with respect to the optimization problem. I modified the public goods games (PGG) to test diverging predictions made by E-PCA for the two competing theories of punishment: group versus individual selection theories. The three chapters (chapters 3, 4, and 5) with their empirical projects demonstrate the power of E-PCA as well as provide unambiguous evidence of individual selection being the dominant force shaping the design of the human anti-free rider punishment system. Across all of the projects with PGG and surveys, the punishers' decisions show that the optimization criterion is the individual relative payoff, not the group payoff. The punishers' decision-making was made in the service of solving the within-group second-order free riding issue, at the expense of group-level optimization and efficiency (chapters 4 and 5). Punishers cared about their relative spending, and tended to reduce their punishment effort compared to those of others; moreover, they were themselves willing to second-order free ride on others (chapters 3 and 5). Punishers also imposed an unnecessary cost on others to prevent them from benefitting from their own sacrifice -- a decision pattern that hurt group-level efficiency (chapter 4). Punishers sent dishonest signals to other members so that more punishment effort would be made by others while privately reducing their own punishment effort (chapter 5). In sum, the empirical evidence for individual selection theory was strong and consistent.",,,
39,Computational studies of barrier-crossing in polymer field theory,"This dissertation is primarily a survey of the zero-temperature string method, a minimum energy path search algorithm, applied to novel barrier-crossing problems in polymer field theory. I apply the method to both self-consistent field theory (SCFT) and a phase-field model (the Landau-Brazovskii model). In the case of SCFT, the focus is on defect annealing problems in homo+copolymer melts; in the case of the Landau-Brazovskii model, the focus is on finding critical nuclei for the disorder-to-lamellar transition, which is known to be a fluctuation-induced first-order phase transition. In SCFT, applying the string method is computationally demanding in both processing time and memory, especially for fully 3-dimensional simulations at industrially relevant system sizes. I successfully address these challenges on state-of-the-art massively parallel computing architectures (NVIDIA graphics processing units). As a result our group is able to identify free energy barriers and transition mechanisms for a wide variety of defect annealing problems relevant to industrial directed self-assembly (DSA). Nucleation in the Landau-Brazovskii model presents its own challenges. The string method as originally formulated is inefficient for nucleation problems, since many images are wasted tracing out unphysical configurations once the nucleus grows to the edges of the simulation cell. I devise a new truncation-based energy weighting (TBEW) scheme that resolves this issue, and will prove valuable to future researchers using the string method to find critical nuclei. Since the bare Landau-Brazovskii model predicts a second-order transition between disorder and lamellae at a mean-field level, naive application of the zero-temperature string method to this model fails to find a barrier. To circumvent this, I instead apply the string method to a renormalized model that incorporates fluctuations at a mean-field level. Using TBEW and the renormalized model, I investigate nucleation pathways for the disorder-to-lamellar transition, finding anisotropic nuclei in agreement with previous predictions and experimental observations. I also conduct a comprehensive search for experimentally observed nuclei containing various exotic defect structures. Finally, I evaluate the validity of the nucleation pathways obtained from the renormalized model by numerically simulating the bare model with explicit fluctuations. I find that the renormalized model makes good predictions for certain quantities, including the location of the order-disorder transition. However, due to sharp dependence of critical nucleus size on proximity to the order-disorder transition, even slight errors in the predicted ODT lead to large errors in predicted nucleus size. I conclude that the renormalized Landau-Brazovskii model is a poor tool for predicting critical nuclei in the fully fluctuating bare theory at experimentally accessible parameters, and recommend that future studies work with the fluctuating bare theory directly. I recommend several strategies to extract barriers and rates.",,,
40,"Contextualizing Diaspora : Studies in Jewish Emplacement, Social Construction, Materiality, and Memory","This dissertation explores the experience of diaspora and traces how it appears, changes, and operates within Judaism. I present case studies that question issues such as origins, reflections on travel, and intergenerational conflict. Each study exposes gaps found in previous studies of diaspora and posits how certain aspects of the phenomenon can be reexamined. I explore these gaps with theoretical models that one would not necessarily associate with diaspora in order to better understand how diaspora operates. I argue that diaspora exists due to its imagined quality and necessity of having to be remembered, through juxtaposition of early Israel's archaeological and textual origins. From consideration of early Israel as partial indigenous peasantry to textual accounts locating Israel's cultural memory as originating elsewhere, a new dimension of diaspora emerges. Emplacements, both spatial and temporal, obscure diaspora, which is an ever-present condition originating as an act/commemoration of remembrance. Another portion of my work confronts how one writes about travel, home, and homeland, especially once one has in fact physically returned; and asks, ""To what shall one commit?"" To answer these questions I look at representative examples of Hebrew fiction and later extend the scope of the investigation to look at more social-scientific and journalistic reflections in Israel. Many scholars studying the Jewish diaspora continue the prevalent understanding of physical homecoming to the Land as a fait accompli, which, according to some interpretations, prohibits creativity and presupposes an already achieved redemption. This approach, however, misunderstands the calls for continued alienation and separation, regardless of location, thus denying access to more ways in which diaspora exists. By employing the theoretical frameworks of the chronotope (time-space literary analysis), as well as threshold and liminal moments, I delve into the possibilities for uncovering recollections and making present unanticipated memories as offered at such moments of confrontation (with the Land, with a sight, a smell, a sound, etc.). Such individual and collective confrontation destabilizes that which has become taken-for-granted and thus renews creativity. When applied to Israeli reflections on intergenerational belonging and outlook, while acknowledging physical emplacement, a tension results from the inability of succeeding generations to identify with and recount the motivations and passions of previous generations. Through writing from the situation of emplacement, we see societal cleavages, continued alienation, and renewed separation. Through an exploration of these gaps we are left asking the same questions of living individuals as we did of literature: ""To what shall one commit, and how shall one commit, if at all?"" The resulting intentional separation of confrontation that we see in these works makes the quotidian extraordinary and the already achieved something to be anticipated. I argue that the Land remains contingent, never accomplished, and is always in a state of ""permanent revolution,"" thus placing into question notions as ""post-Zionism."" Even while being emplaced, possibilities exist for re-diasporization -- the need to feel distanced from the Land considered ""home"" in order to return to the condition prior to homecoming. This threshold that re-presents unforeseen memories is a call for ethical action now, and in the future, of the yet unredeemed, of being in imagined diaspora. The fourth subset explores the ways in which Jewish genetic diseases are understood within Jewish communities and what genetics research offers in terms of complements to foundational myths of Judaism. In both diaspora studies and genetics research the history of the phenomenon and an understanding of what constitutes it offer different, but necessarily concomitant, myths/authoritative narratives. Through the continuing use of Walter Benjamin's call for contextualization across space and through time, I echo those who advocate for incorporating both the biological and socially constructed aspects of identity. This approach, rather than privileging one perspective, allows for a better understanding of migration, and acknowledges that genetic markers help place into question notions as kinship (to whom one feels connected), from what one feels displaced, etc., thus offering a more comprehensive view to constructed identity. We already always are displaced, have multiple homes, and struggle to articulate this complexity using only one paradigm. These concerns are reflected in the Jewish concept of brit (covenant), which includes both biology and social construction; only through the use of both aspects does a more comprehensive appreciation of ""home,"" ""origins,"" belonging, separation, and community/commitment emerge.",,,
41,A Reflexive Approach in Coming to Know : Uncovering the Logic-of-Inquiry in Ethnographic Research,"A Reflexive Approach In Coming to Know: Uncovering the Logic-of-Inquiry in Ethnographic Research By Monaliza Maximo Chian For the past three decades there has been a growing call for researchers in the social sciences across disciplines and in educational research, to place a greater emphasis on being more reflexive in both the research process and the reporting not only what was found but also their methodological logic-of-inquiry they engaged to construct the ""findings"" or accounts from their studies (Marcus & Clifford, 1986; Atkinson, 1990; Ellen, 1994). In Education, the American Educational Research Association (AERA) addressed this argument by constructing a set of Standards for Reporting on Empirical Social Science Research ( 2006) framed the argument the need for transparency in reporting on the conduct of both qualitative and quantitative research studies. Furthermore, as inscribed by many scholars and leaders in the field of educational as well as educational research (e.g., Arthur, Waring, Coe, Hedges, 2012; Green, Skukauskaite, & Baker, 2012; Anderson-Levitt, 2006; Green, Camilli & Elmore, 2006; American Educational Research Association, 2006; Heath, 1982) the basic foundation of any educational research is an understanding of the researcher's ontological and epistemological assumptions on the nature of the phenomena under study. Therefore, this dissertation takes a reflexive approach in coming to understand how to think ethnographically by examining how and in what ways an intergenerational Interactional Ethnography (IE) research team jointly conceptualized a shared logic-of-inquiry that framed the (co) construction of a logic-in-use in order to address the challenges of conducting a multifaceted and technology-enabled ethnographic research study of a developing instructional program within a larger institutional project initiative in a public regional university. Guided by the Interactional Ethnography framework, the ethnographer conducted a reflexive analysis of two telling cases (Mitchell, 1984) of her reconstruction of key cycles of analysis that were undertaken by her with her IE team in order to examine the series of actions and decisions required in order to uncover what she and her team needed to know, understand, and undertake in order to strive to develop emic perspectives on the development of the principles and processes of integrating long term and futures thinking concepts into established contents of undergraduate courses within the Organizational Communication department in higher education. The researcher drew on both archive records collected and constructed by her team (video records, transcripts of interviews, field notes, and final reports) and archive records of the external team (annual reports, 8 syllabi, lesson plans, course notes). Discussions of findings from this reflexive study presented a set of principles of operations (c.f, Heath; 1982; Green, Skukauskaite, & Baker, 2012) that there were developed to reflect on and to interrogate the ontological as well as epistemological theories guiding the methodologies of data collection, construction, analysis, and interpretation at multiple points across the research process.",,,
42,The cohesive function of prosody in Ekegusii (Kisii) narratives : A functional-typological approach,"This thesis aims to advance the idea that prosody is fundamentally about creating cohesion, that is, signaling the ""relations of meaning that exist within the text"" (Halliday & Hasan 1976:4). Building on research on the cohesive function of prosody by Wichmann (2000) and Wennerstrom (2001), I show how each of the features generally referred to as prosodic are used by speakers to lend cohesion to their discourse by signaling the transitions from one unit of discourse to the next, the relations that hold between those units, and their relative prominence. To accomplish this, I look at six prosodic cues in Ekegusii, a Great Lakes Bantu language of southwestern Kenya with lexical and grammatical tone (Cammenga 2002; Nash 2011). Those cues are pause, vowel elision, prosodic accent, pitch reset, isotony (intonational parallelism), and intonational contour. For each feature, I exemplify the ways in which it demarcates conceptually cohesive units of discourse, and/or signals the relations between one unit of speech and another. I show that when these prosodic cues appear, they create cohesive ties between one segment of discourse and another by signaling where one discourse topic ends and another begins, and indicating how -- and how closely -- the new discourse topic relates to the old (Couper-Kuhlen 2004; Swerts & Geluykens 1994). Together with morphosyntactic devices for cohesion, such as anaphoric pronouns and reference, the cohesive ties created by prosody are what give coherence to the text, thus distinguishing it from a random assortment of unrelated utterances (Halliday & Hasan 1976). I conclude by discussing how an understanding of prosody as a means for signaling discourse cohesion complements more interactional approaches to prosody (Barth-Weingarten 2013; Barth-Weingarten & Reber 2010; Couper-Kuhlen & Ford 2004), and provides a language-independent means of examining prosody crosslinguistically, thus laying a foundation for future typological studies.",,,
43,"Ionic liquids as antimicrobials, solvents, and prodrugs for treating skin disease","The skin is the largest organ in the body. It provides a compliant interface for needle-free drug delivery, while avoiding major degradative pathways associated with the GI tract. These can result in improved patient compliance and sustained and controlled release compared to other standard delivery methods such as intravenous injection, subcutaneous injection, and oral delivery. Concurrently, for the treatment of skin related diseases (e.g. bacterial infection, skin cancer, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, etc.) cutaneous application provides targeted delivery to the disease site, allowing the use of more potent therapeutics with fewer systemic side effects. Unfortunately, the outer layer of the skin -- the stratum corneum (SC) -- presents a significant barrier to most foreign material. This is particularly true for large hydrophilic molecules (>500Da), which must partition through tortuous lipid channels in the SC to penetrate deep tissue layers where the majority of skin-related diseases reside. Interestingly, over the last few decades ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as a burgeoning class of designer solvents. ILs have been proven beneficial for use in industrial processing, catalysis, pharmaceuticals, and electrochemistry to name a few. The ability to modulate either the cation or anion individually presents an advantageous framework for tuning secondary characteristics without sacrificing the primary function of the IL. Here we report the use of novel ILs for cutaneous drug delivery. Specifically, we demonstrate their potential as potent, broad-spectrum antimicrobials, as solvents for topical delivery of hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, and as prodrugs to either reduce the dose-dependent toxicity of drugs that cause skin irritation or enhance delivery of macromolecules into skin and cells. Thus, our results clearly demonstrate ILs holds promise as a transformative platform for treating skin disease.",,,
44,"Coping Strategies, PTSD Symptoms, Substance Abuse, and Life Satisfaction : A Working Model","The present research focused on understanding the roles of coping strategy (avoidant, problem solving, and support seeking) and trauma history in predicting Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms and life satisfaction. Exposure to traumatic events is common in the general population, and lifetime prevalence rates for PTSD are relatively high and are estimated at 8.7% among adults in the United States. Although the psychological impact of highly stressful events can be considerable, the development of PTSD profoundly affects the individual's overall quality of life. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the relation between coping strategy, trauma history, PTSD symptoms, and life satisfaction. To decrease measurement error, latent variables were created for PTSD symptoms and life satisfaction. Both the main effects and interactions associated with coping strategy and trauma history were investigated. Three separate SEM models were constructed to investigate avoidant, problem solving, and support seeking coping strategies, which have been shown to be temporally stable traits. To investigate the hypothesized model in a non-clinical sample, completed data from 326 participants were analyzed. Two separate subsamples were targeted and included community members and college students. Community members were approached at a large shopping center and college students were approached on campus. All participants received an incentive, which included gift certificates, cash, or course credit immediately after completion of the research assessments. Bivariate analyses failed to support two separate subsamples in terms of demographics, coping strategies, or trauma history; therefore, one combined sample was used for analyses. The demographics of the combined sample were much more similar to the demographics associated with college students than community members. Overall, 80.1% of participants reported at least one exposure to a wide variety of traumatic events. Hypotheses regarding coping strategies in this sample, which was largely comprised of college students, were not supported. Both problem solving and support seeking coping strategies failed to significantly predict PTSD symptoms. Even more surprising was that in this sample avoidant coping actually predicted a decrease in PTSD symptoms. Results indicated that participants who experienced high levels of traumatic events benefited from a greater reduction in PTSD symptoms compared to those who had experienced low levels of traumatic events. In all three coping strategies, an increased trauma history predicted a significant increase in PTSD symptoms, and an increase in PTSD symptoms predicted an even greater decrease in life satisfaction. In addition, an increase in trauma history actually predicted a small increase in life satisfaction when not mediated by PTSD symptoms. This indicated that in this sample exposure to traumatic events slightly increased life satisfaction when individuals did not experience adverse affects associated with the exposure. Also unexpected was the finding that avoidant coping predicted a slight increase in life satisfaction while support seeking predicted a slight decrease in life satisfaction.",,,
45,Merchants and marauders : Genoese maritime predation in the twelfth-century Mediterranean,"In this dissertation, I examine maritime predation conducted by and against the people of Genoa, Italy during the long twelfth century: 1100-1215 CE. Maritime predation, or piracy, was an endemic phenomenon in the medieval Mediterranean, but very little scholarship exists on the subject. In this study I demonstrate that rich documentation on virtually every aspect of maritime predation exist, both in narrative sources, and in notarial and diplomatic records housed in the Archivio di Stato in Genoa, and that maritime predation was a licit, and even celebrated activity in the period under investigation that involved a wide array of actors, both on the land and sea. I show that Maritime predation in twelfth-century Genoa was both an industry in its own right, and an integral part of the fabric of Genoese society. The importance of this activity to the cities that practiced and were victimized by it has been greatly underestimated by scholars. My study aims to rectify that, and to suggest new avenues for the study of maritime violence and predation. In Chapter One, I investigate the context of maritime predation in twelfth-century Genoa. I first describe the nature of the sources that are available for studying Genoese life in this period, and discuss both the interpretive limitations and possibilities that these sources offer. I also investigate the emergence, structure, and evolution of Genoa's communal government, which began to take shape at the beginning of the twelfth century. I argue that the precocious documentary culture emerged in Genoa, with its strong emphasis on record-keeping, served to meet the unique needs of a society heavily engaged in long-term collaborative investments and overseas trade. As a result, a wealth of documentation exists from this period, which makes the study of maritime predation, commerce, and many other aspects of daily life in the city possible. In Chapter Two, I investigate how normal commerce functioned in Genoa, and focus on the activities along Genoa's waterfront district, the Ripa Maris. I show that commerce was not just the activity of handful of travelling merchants, but that it involved men and women from all walks of life, working together as investors, harvesters, manufacturers, shop-owners, ship-builders and so forth. I also discuss the various regions with which the Genoese traded, and demonstrate that Genoa played a special role in commerce between various Muslim regions of the Mediterranean. Finally, I investigate both the Genoese participation in the Crusades, and their long-held hostility towards the neighboring Pisans, and argue that the Genoese sense of enmity was very different from what traditional narratives of faith relations in the medieval Mediterranean might lead one to expect. In Chapter Three, I discuss the historiography of piracy/maritime predation in the medieval Mediterranean, and examine exactly what kinds of documentation exist on the subject. I argue that it is actually inaccurate to use the term ""piracy"" in this context, as maritime predation was a licit activity, regulated by the government, and taxed by the archbishop, traditional commerce was. I also demonstrate that the vocabulary used in Genoese sources to discuss predation was the same terminology that was used for the terrestrial hunt. I finally investigate the kinds of ships that records indicate were used in maritime predation, and argue that the medieval Genoese boasted a far more varied arsenal of tools for predation than the scholarship has previously indicated. In Chapter Four, I examine a series of notarial contracts for the outfitting of predatory voyages, and break down the many steps that the process entailed. Through these contracts, I demonstrate that maritime predation was conducted as a highly-collaborative business venture that involved numerous investors, contractors, and other personnel, and that the contracts used to orchestrate these voyages were the same as those used to organize traditional commerce. I also identify many of the individuals who were engaged in maritime predation, and show that both members of the laboring classes and Genoa's elite frequently engaged in this activity, and that it was, in fact, members of the elite who were most often found organizing major predatory voyages. In Chapter Five, I discuss the targets of maritime predation, and the various methods that were used to try and prevent predation. I analyze the locations where maritime predation frequently took place, and argue that local knowledge and the ongoing collection of intelligence by sea captains were both integral to keeping ships safe. I also explore some of the methods that the commune used to prevent the capture of Genoese ships, and argue that just as Genoa's elites were often responsible for organizing and engaging in predation, they were also obliged to provide for the protection of merchant vessels. I also show that it is virtually impossible to draw a line between where defensive patrolling ended and offensive predation began. In Chapter Six, I discuss the tactics utilized by maritime predators, themselves, which is a topic that has not been addressed for this period. I demonstrate that predators had a wide variety of tactics at their disposal, and that elaborate networks existed for relaying information about the movement of ships. I discuss the identification of ships at sea through the use of flags and other signals, and the dangers of false identifications. I finally discuss a number of less common forms of maritime predation, including the commandeering of ships and cargoes from ports, which were considered predatory by contemporaries. Throughout this chapter, I demonstrate that a vast array of actors, working on both land and sea, were involved in maritime predation, and that it was a highly collaborative activity that linked people together, even as it divided them. In Chapter Seven, I conclude my investigation with an epilogue that analyzes changes in maritime predation around the turn of the thirteenth century. I demonstrate that the advent of a new kind of armed sailing ship revolutionized both normal commerce and maritime predation, resulting in a kind of medieval arms race at sea. I argue that this kind of advance shows that, while many aspects of seafaring may have remained constant throughout the Age of Sail, maritime predation was a highly contextual phenomenon that varied greatly depending on the political, social, and technological context. This, maritime predation it is a subject that must be studied carefully, and in context.",,,
46,The Enduring Impact of a Male's Early Environment on his Neuroendocrine and Behavioral Response to Becoming a First-time Father,"This dissertation research tested a model predicting that human fathers invest in offspring in patterns that vary as a function of information assayed from a father's own early environment (e.g., cues indicating environmental harshness and/or unpredictability during a father's early development). Human fathers exhibit plasticity with regard to the level of investment provided to offspring. The endocrine substrates that have evolved to support these facultative paternal responses to environmental conditions should also demonstrate similar (and closely aligned) variation from one ecological context to the next. The nature of the specific ecological cues that a father's endocrine and behavioral systems rely on for developmental calibration has not been entirely elucidated. This study provided a test of the level of paternal investment in a newborn infant's life, based on a father's own early life experience with environmental harshness and instability and the degree to which a father's neuroendocrine system (i.e., testosterone) responds to the birth of his child. Our research team conducted three home visits that were scheduled across a 9-10 month period: Time 1 was in the late third trimester of pregnancy, Time 2 was three months following the birth of the child, and Time 3 took place when the infant was 9-10 months old. We recruited 226 two-parent, first-birth families. Participants provided self-report measures of early life experiences: i.e., scales designed to measure early SES and exposure to trauma. At each visit, participants also provided two saliva samples (AM and PM) at each collection period to be assayed for testosterone. Lastly, we measured investment in two ways: (1) an Experience Sampling Method administered survey that measured the quantity of time fathers spent with their infants; (2) a measure of paternal quality of care---infants (9-10 months) old were exposed to novel stimuli intended to elicit a fear response. Videos of paternal behaviors were coded by independent raters (for quality of care, e.g., warmth, support). While we did see significant variation between fathers in the quantity of time they reported interacting with their infants, the level of trauma experienced in childhood or a father's own childhood SES could not account for this variance. When measuring paternal investment quality however, early childhood experience influenced how fathers interacted with their infants during the stimuli exercise. Fathers who reported being raised in low SES environments and who experienced trauma in childhood displayed lower levels of quality care. Levels of testosterone (on average) decreased from Time 1 to Time 2. We detected significant individual variation between males in (1) their baseline level of testosterone prior to childbirth; (2) the slope of their testosterone response to childbirth; and (3) the slope of their testosterone's ascent back to baseline levels. However, neither childhood SES nor trauma could account for this variability. We did detect (non-significant statistical trends) that the degree (i.e., slope) to which testosterone recovered from Time 2 to Time 3 was related to paternal investment of both time and investment quality. Fathers who had a higher slope of recovery demonstrated decreased levels of investment quality and quantity.",,,
47,Information Reliability on the Social Web Models and Applications in Intelligent User Interfaces,"The Social Web is undergoing continued evolution, changing the paradigm of information production, processing and sharing. Information sources have shifted from institutions to individual users, vastly increasing the amount of information available online. To overcome the information overload problem, modern filtering algorithms have enabled people to find relevant information in efficient ways. However, noisy, false and otherwise useless information remains a problem. We believe that the concept of information reliability needs to be considered along with information relevance to adapt filtering algorithms to today's Social Web. This approach helps to improve information search and discovery and can also improve user experience by communicating aspects of information reliability. This thesis first shows the results of a cross-disciplinary study into perceived reliability by reporting on a novel user experiment. This is followed by a discussion of modeling, validating, and communicating information reliability, including its various definitions across disciplines. A selection of important reliability attributes such as source credibility, competence, influence and timeliness are examined through different case studies. Results show that perceived reliability of information can vary greatly across contexts. Finally, recent studies on visual analytics, including algorithm explanations and interactive interfaces are discussed with respect to their impact on the perception of information reliability in a range of application domains.",,,
48,Optical measurement and control of topological insulators,"The spin-polarized surface states of topological insulators (TIs) are expected to host a number of unusual electromagnetic and quantum-mechanical phenomena. These properties make them attractive for applications in spintronics and quantum computing. However, high quality TI materials are often difficult to synthesize and control. Many proposed experiments involving TIs require spatial control over time-reversal symmetry breaking and electron chemical potential. We have developed a set of microscopy and control techniques that allow us to study and manipulate both the chemical potential and magnetization of TI thin films on a few-micrometer scale. A central challenge with TI materials is to reliably tune the chemical potential of their electrons with respect to the Dirac point and the bulk bands. We demonstrate persistent, bidirectional optical control of the chemical potential of non-magnetic (Bi,Sb)2Te3 thin films grown on SrTiO3. By optically modulating a space-charge layer in the SrTiO3 substrates, we induce a persistent field effect in the TI films comparable to electrostatic gating techniques but without additional materials or processing. This enables us to optically write and erase p-n junctions in these films, which we study with scanning photocurrent microscopy. The ability to optically write and erase mesoscopic electronic structures in a TI may aid in the investigation of the unique properties of the topological insulating phase. The gating effect also generalizes to other thin-film materials grown on SrTiO3, suggesting that this optical gating effect could provide local optical control of chemical potential in a wide range of ultrathin and 2D electronic systems. Breaking time-reversal symmetry at the surface of a TI can lead to exotic physical phenomena such as 1D quantized edge states and unique magnetoelectric effects. Ferromagnetic TI materials provide a means of breaking time-reversal symmetry without an externally-applied magnetic field. We use scanning Kerr microscopy to study the behavior of ferromagnetic domains in thin films of Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 grown on different substrates in and different regimes of magnetic doping. Moreover, we demonstrate a magneto-optical recording technique that allows us to write and erase micron-scale patterns in the local magnetization of these films. The ability to control time-reversal symmetry breaking at a micron scale may be particularly useful in studying the 1D quantized edge states predicted to exist along magnetic domain walls in these materials. Furthermore, we show that optical gating effect we studied in non-magnetic TI materials also applies to magnetically-doped thin films. We suggest that persistent, bidirectional optical control of chemical potential and magnetization in TI thin films may enable a wide variety of experiments in TI and low-dimensional physics.",,,

In this dissertation we explore four unique platforms for real-time microfluidic measurement, analysis, and control systems with applications at the intersection of biomedicine and materials engineering. First, we show that a real-time biosensor can be used to perform closed-loop control of drug concentrations in the bloodstream of live animals. Second, we show that a commercially available cell-sorting instrument can be used to sort heterogeneous suspensions of synthetic microparticles based on shape using optical scattering measurements, resulting in monodisperse microparticle suspensions with well-defined morphology. Third, we report preliminary results for an image-based cell and microparticle sorter capable of sorting objects using two-dimensional high-speed microscopy and real-time image analysis. Finally, we report a contamination-resistant microfluidic assay for quantitative genetic detection based on real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification, improving the robustness of point-of-care pathogen detection techniques.",,,
50,Group III-V Nanowire Growth and Characterization,"Electronic and optical devices typically use bulk or quantum wells today, but nanowires are promising building blocks for future devices, due to their structural characterizations of larger aspect ratio and smaller volume. In situ growth of semiconductor devices is extremely attractive, as it doesn't require expensive lithography treatment. Over the past ten years, a great deal of work has been done to explore NW, incorporation of group III-V materials and band engineering for the electronic and optoelectronic devices. Because pseudo one-dimensional heterostructures may be grown without involving lattice mismatch defects, NWs may give rise to superior electronic, photonic, and magnetic performances as compared to conventional bulk or planar structures.",,,
51,Growth Development of III-Nitrides for Electronic Devices by Molecular Beam Epitaxy,"Immense work on the III-nitrides has taken place over the past quarter century. Nevertheless, many properties still remain poorly understood. Further knowledge and improvements of these materials will lead to superior device performance and realization of new device structures. In this work, III-nitrides were grown by molecular beam epitaxy and studied by multiple characterization techniques. Systematic studies examined the effect of different growth conditions on material properties of n-type GaN, p-type GaN and InAlN. n-type GaN was grown by ammonia based molecular beam epitaxy and growth optimization was performed using electron mobility as the metric. Lattice imperfections scatter carriers, therefore, material with more imperfections has lower electron mobility. Dislocation density was identified as an important parameter. III-nitrides are often grown heteroepitaxially resulting in threading dislocation densities from 108 to 10 11 cm-2. Electron mobility was found to decrease significantly with increasing dislocation density. The highest electron mobility was demonstrated by layers grown on free-standing GaN with a dislocation density of 10 6 cm-2. Temperature-dependent electron mobility and carrier concentration data for samples grown under similar conditions but with different dislocation densities was fit using known scattering mechanisms and the charge balance equation. Electron scattering by dislocations was evaluated and quantified. p-type GaN is difficult to grow. The magnesium dopant in GaN has a large activation energy and often is passivated or compensated by hydrogen or other defects. High conductivity p-type GaN is of interest for devices such as tunnel junctions and p-n diodes. The use of an indium surfactant was previously shown to improve structural and electrical properties of GaN grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By using indium during the growth of magnesium doped GaN, an increase in hole concentration was observed. Temperature-dependent carrier statistics and deep level optical and transient spectroscopy led to the understanding that the indium surfactant causes a reduction in donor incorporation. The donor is believed to be related to a nitrogen vacancy or a nitrogen vacancy complex. InAlN is an interesting material system: it has possible bandgaps ranging from 0.7 eV (InN) to 6.2 eV (AlN), it can be lattice matched to GaN, and it can produce a very high sheet charge density, two dimensional electron gas when grown epitaxially on GaN. InAlN grown by plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy often has a honeycomb microstructure. We have developed the growth InAlN without honeycomb microstructure over a wide range of indium compositions. Growth was performed at low temperature, high indium to aluminum flux ratios, and high active nitrogen to metal flux ratios. Microstructure uniformity was examined by transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. A growth diagram was developed for InAlN without honeycomb microstructure.",,,
52,"Assessing Marine Resources Using Ecology, Fisheries Science, and Expert Judgment","One of the most challenging issues facing resource managers is how to prioritize conservation goals within ecosystems. Firstly, I found experts primarily used percent change and trophic impact as the basis for assigning ranks to ecosystem impacts. Mudflats, beach, salt marshes, and rocky intertidal were judged most vulnerable, and the highest stressor rankings included invasive species, ocean acidification, sea temperature change, and demersal destructive fishing. Secondly, I investigated how demographic metrics of the red sea urchin Mesocentrotus franciscanus varied in response to protection, temperature, and the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. Thirdly, I demonstrated that urchin reproduction can predict fishing industry's standard quality ratings, price, effort, and landings. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of urchin's reproduction is not only useful in understanding the ecology and population biology of this species, but also it is essential for managers and policymakers to direct efficient management and ensure sustainability, particularly under future climate change scenarios.",,,
53,DNA-stabilized fluorescent silver nanoclusters : A versatile nanomaterial for the specific detection of DNA,"DNA-templated silver nanoclusters (DNA-AgNCs) are fluorescent molecules containing few-atom clusters of silver stabilized by a short strand of DNA. They fluoresce at wavelengths in the visible spectrum with emission colors tuned by varying the sequence of the DNA used for their synthesis. The combination of their small size, tunable spectra and biocompatibility opens exciting, new possibilities for their use in chemical sensing, biological labeling and imaging, genetic mutation detection and the development of self-assembled DNA nanotechnologies. A detailed understanding of the structure of DNA-AgNCs is vital for precisely engineering their properties for future applications. Specifically, changes in the arrangement and composition of bases surrounding a AgNC can strongly influence its fluorescence. Although this sensitivity has already been leveraged for the development of novel chemical sensors, a better understanding of the mechanism is needed to improve performance and broaden the applicability of DNA stabilized AgNCs. In this work, we use high-resolution microfluidic capillary electrophoresis to show that, although AgNC depend on single-stranded DNA for their stabilization, changes made to bases in the double-stranded stem region of a DNA hairpin can perturb their structure, leading to differences in fluorescence emission. We also explore ways in which AgNC can be robust to DNA sequence changes. We document one DNA-AgNC in which the DNA adopts different conformations, or shapes, that yield clusters with the same emission color. We also show that poly-thymidine regions, which are know to bind silver poorly,can act as convenient handles to adjust the electrophoretic mobility of DNA-AgNCs without affecting their fluorescence. Using poly-thymidine appendages, we demonstrate a way to tune the electrophoretic mobility of a AgNC-based DNA probe for use in a microfluidic assay. These label-free probes are composed of a DNA hairpin that generates a fluorescent silver nanocluster only after binding to a specific target DNA sequence. By tuning the mobility of probes designed to bind different targets, we demonstrate a rapid microfluidic separation assay for the multiplexed fluorescent detection of nucleic acid targets for Hepatitis A, B and C. The probe design initially used for these studies suffered from several shortcomings. Most significantly, the probe DNA failed to generate a fluorescent AgNC for some binding domain sequences. To overcome this, as well as provide added functionality, we engineer a new DNA-AgNC based sensor that supports ratiometric fluorescence measurements for the sensitive, specific and low-cost detection of DNA. Probes based on our new design generate a green emitting AgNC in its hairpin state, and a red emitting AgNC after binding their target. The ratiometric fluorescence provides a stable signal and rapid quantification of DNA concentration regardless of the choice of target, a dramatic improvement over similar turn-on fluorescent probes.",,,
54,Hidden Markov Models for Analysis of Multimodal Biomedical Images,"Modern advances in imaging technology have enabled the collection of huge amounts of multimodal imagery of complex biological systems. The extraction of information from this data and subsequent analysis are essential in understanding the architecture and dynamics of these systems. Due to the sheer volume of the data, manual annotation and analysis is usually infeasible, and robust automated techniques are the need of the hour. In this dissertation, we present three hidden Markov model (HMM)-based methods for automated analysis of multimodal biomedical images. First, we outline a novel approach to simultaneously classify and segment multiple cells of different classes in multi-biomarker images. A 2D HMM is set up on the superpixel lattice obtained from the input image. Parameters ensuring spatial consistency of labels and high confidence in local class selection are embedded in the HMM framework, and learnt with the objective of maximizing discrimination between classes. Optimal labels are inferred using the HMM, and are aggregated to obtain global multiple object segmentation. We then address the problem of automated spatial alignment of images from different modalities. We propose a probabilistic framework, constructed using a 2D HMM, for deformable registration of multimodal images. The HMM is tailored to capture deformation via state transitions, and modality-specific representation via class-conditional emission probabilities. The latter aspect is premised on the realization that different modalities may provide very different representation for a given class of objects. Parameters of the HMM are learned from data, and hence the method is applicable to a wide array of datasets. In the final part of the dissertation, we describe a method for automated segmentation and subsequent tracking of cells in a challenging target image modality, wherein useful information from a complementary (source) modality is effectively utilized to assist segmentation. Labels are estimated in the source domain, and then transferred to generate preliminary segmentations in the target domain. A 1D HMM-based algorithm is used to refine segmentation boundaries in the target image, and subsequently track cells through a 3D image stack. This dissertation details techniques for classification, segmentation and registration, that together form a comprehensive system for automated analysis of multimodal biomedical datasets.",,,
55,From Tragedy to Testimony : Bare Life and the Hermeneutics of Suffering,"My dissertation explores efforts within contemporary theory to think beyond the exclusionary logic of the humanist paradigm---namely, those expressions at the intersection of biopolitics and theories of life (Giorgio Agamben, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze), Animal Studies (Cary Wolfe), ethics (Emmanuel Levinas, Jacques Derrida), and aesthetics (Jacques Ranciere) which, in the turn away from logos and toward its myriad 'others,' invoke a network of conceptual correlates for what is initially, if not ultimately, understood as suffering. Situating this 'post-humanist' critique within the greater philosophical project to overcome the problem of suffering by way of suffering itself, I present Agamben's conception of 'bare life,' the principal figure of suffering in modernity, as a hermeneutic within a genealogy of techniques, from tragedy to testimony, that aims to transpose suffering into the promise of political and ontological freedom. This 'promise' which Agamben glimpses in the figure of 'bare life' and articulates in profound re-conceptions of subjectivity, freedom, power, and political agency, offers new insight into the particular authority and disciplinary capacities of literary productions composed from or about this form of subjectivity. Thus, in my readings of the American slave narrative (Frederick Douglass), as well as Holocaust (Elie Wiesel), Apartheid and animal rights literature (J.M. Coetzee) as 'narratives of bare life,' I seek to illuminate their production and reception as the outcomes of a biopolitical logic. This approach works to counter the limitations and pitfalls of the human rights narrative in which these texts have typically been received---a narrative whose teleological notion of the human forecloses the possibility of an ethics which takes into account the human potential for its own inhumanity.",,,
56,Teachers' and Administrators' Views of Organizational Improvement and Student Success in a Themed Professional Learning Community,"California Partnership Academies (CPAs) are a form of school reform. CPAs build on previous reform efforts by addressing site-specific theme-based learning. Further, CPAs are theme-based professional learning communities, established as small schools within a school, preparing students for college and as well as the careers associated with given themes. Green Careers (GCA) is one such academy. In this study, I explored participants' perspectives about one existing CPA, with particular attention to its development as being initially denied state certification as Linked Learning to it successfully becoming Linked Learning certified (i.e. designating it as a career pathway that combines rigorous academics, demanding technical education, personalized student supports and real-world experiences in order to engage students and make learning relevant). I explored the requirements placed on CPAs and how the GCA Academy operated within those requirements. Utilizing participant research, interviews, and documents, I examined district Pathways support, and how site administration, academy advisory board, and the academy team members made ""changes in practice"" (Stern, Dayton, & Raby, 2010, p. 24) as a professional learning community, a small learning community, and a learning organization. Also examined was how those perspectives reflected the four frames for understanding organizations (Bolman and Deal, 2008) and to what extent these views reflected the GCA Academy operating as a unique-case and in what ways they operated as a typical-case (Yin, 2009).",,,
57,Best Methods for Obtaining Absolute Water Velocity Profiles from Gliders with ADCPs,"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) like gliders are typically used to obtain vertical cross sections of water properties along transects. Another, less common, application is the use of gliders as virtual moorings. Gliders offer many advantages compared with conventional moorings, but extensive evaluation of gliders as mooring substitutes has not been done. Here, temperature and ocean current velocity data from coincidently deployed gliders-as- moorings and moorings are compared to assess the fidelity of glider-as-mooring data. The glider-as-mooring data were processed in a variety of ways and compared with mooring. During August 2012, two gliders sampled in a box pattern around a conventional mooring in 26 m water depth off of Pt. Sal, California for two and six days, respectively. Two box patterns were used, one 500 m on a side (two and four days) and the other 1 km on a side (two days). Temperature and velocity data from the gliders and moorings are compared using linear regressions and contouring techniques. Linear regressions show good agreement between glider and mooring temperatures (r2 = 0.89, p < 0.001). Significant correlations are also found between ADCP-derived velocities from the gliders and the mooring; along-shore velocities exhibit higher correlation (r2 = 0.70, p < 0.001) compared with cross-shore velocities (r2 = 0.37, p < 0.001). Glider versus glider comparisons are similar to glider versus mooring comparisons in the along-shore (r2 = 0.60, p < 0.001) and cross-shore (r 2 = 0.36, p < 0.001) directions. Temperature comparisons between gliders also show good agreement (r2 = 0.93, p < 0.001 ).",,,
58,"Iphigenia in Adaptation : Neoclassicism, Gender, and Culture on the Public Stages of France and England, 1674-1779","This dissertation interrogates the role of adaptation in creating and maintaining hegemonic cultural formations through a study of two tragedies by Euripides as they were adapted by neoclassical playwrights during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in France and England. Adaptation studies, a relatively new field of academic inquiry, has thus far largely focused on defining adaptation in relation to more established studies of translation and intertextuality, and has primarily concentrated on cross-medium adaptations such as novels adapted into film. Taking these focuses as a point of departure, this study expands the field of adaptation studies by looking at adaptation not across medium, but across time and culture, through the examination of stage plays that were rewritten for public performance in early modern Western Europe hundreds of years after their initial performances in ancient Greece. In this context, with no change in medium, the uses of adaptation as a tool for disguising cultural difference are revealed, refocusing the scholarly discussion of adaptation from a search for definitions to an exploration of its implications for cultural studies. Exploring the ways in which new ideas about religion, gender, and morality made unadapted Greek tragedies unsuitable for public presentation on early modern stages, the case studies examine the alterations made in nine different adaptations of the two Iphigenia plays that have come down to us from ancient Athens. Looking at adaptations of adaptations (Gluck's operatic adaptation of Racine's retelling of Iphigenia in Aulis, for example) alongside direct adaptations of Greek tragedies, this study argues that local cultural conventions may be threatened by even very recent versions of a story, and that adaptation is leveraged accordingly in order to neutralize such ideological threats. In the process, this exploration traces the ways in which neoclassicism was interpreted and reinterpreted as it shifted times, locations, and genres: from the seventeenth century to the eighteenth, France to England, and spoken tragedy to opera.",,,
59,Parameter Estimation for Stable Distributions : Spacings-based and Indirect Inference,"Stable distributions are important family of parametric distributions widely used in signal processing as well as in mathematical finance. Estimation of the parameters of this model, is not quite straightforward due to the fact that there is no closed-form expression for their probability density function. Besides the computationally intensive maximum likelihood method where the density has to be evaluated numerically, there are some existing adhoc methods such as the quantile method, and a regression based method. These are introduced in Chapter 2. In this thesis, we introduce two new approaches: One, a spacing based estimation method introduced in Chapter 3 and two, an indirect inference method considered in Chapter 4. Simulation studies show that both these methods are very robust and efficient and do as well or better than the existing methods in most cases. Finally in Chapter 5, we use indirect inference approach to estimate the best fitting income distribution based on limited information that is often available.",,,
61,Understanding and engineering two-dimensional electron gases in complex oxides,"The next generation of electronic devices faces the challenge of adequately containing and controlling extremely high charge densities within structures of nanometer dimensions. Atomic-scale transistors must be thin and be able to control extremely high charge densities (>10e13/cm. 2). Silicon devicestypically have two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) densities around 10e12/cm. 2.Nitride-based devices can sustain densities an order of magnitude higher. The ""complex oxides"" have recently emerged as an attractive materials system to support these developments. The demonstration of a 2DEG at the SrTiO 3/LaAlO3 interface has triggered an avalanche of research, including the unprecedentedly high density of 3x10e14/cm. 2 at SrTiO3/GdTiO3and SrTiO3/SmTiO3 interfaces. Metal-insulator (Mott) transitions that are inherent to some of these complex oxides could offer even greater prospects for enhanced functionality or novel device concepts. The materials and heterostructures that have been explored to date are clearly only a small subset of the vast number of materials combinations that could lead to interesting phenomena. In this work we use first-principles methods to build greater understanding of the interface phenomena, so that searches can be better informed and more focused. We also develop a set of criteria that the materials and their heterostructures should satisfy to develop a high-performance 2DEG-based device. We focus in particular on the band alignment, calculating it for a variety of different potential materials. Next, we study GdTiO3/SrTiO3/GdTiO3 heterostructures in depth, where each interface contributes excess electrons into the SrTiO3. We calculate the 2DEG formation for a superlattice containing six layers of SrTiO3, and compare with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results. Together, the experimental and theoretical results conclusively show that the 2DEG results from the interface itself, and does not originate from a secondary source such as oxygen vacancies. These heterostructures also exhibit a metal-to-insulator transition as the SrTiO 3 layer thickness decreases, which could possibly be used as a ""Mott field effect transistor"" --- the system is very close to a metal-to-insulator transition, and modulating a small fraction of the electron density would lead to switching between the metallic and insulating phases. The mechanism behind this transition is unraveled, and we construct a bulk model of the transition based on the surprising observation that SrTiO3 itself can become a Mott insulator when doped with an extremely high density of electrons. Building on our study of the SrTiO3/GdTiO3 interfaces, we investigate the electronic structure of GdTiO3 in detail - our calculated band gap differs markedly from past experimental values, but is consistent with recent photoluminescence measurements. We find that the presence of small hole polarons leads to a feature in the optical absorption spectrum which was previously interpreted to be the band gap. Since small hole polarons are present in all the rare-earth titanates, not only GdTiO3, the values of the band gaps (also based on optical absorption measurements) across the series will likely have to be revised. Lastly, to understand the formation of small hole polarons in the rare-earth titanates, we study point defects and impurities in GdTiO3. We also investigate how defects may impact the behavior of GdTiO3 in electronic devices.",,,
62,An evaluation of the drivers of movement and foraging behaviors of tropical parrotfishes across management regimes and spatiotemporal scales,"There is abundant evidence that herbivorous fishes play an important role in mediating the competitive interactions between corals and algae and that with the reduction or absence of these grazers there may be regime shifts from domination by reef-building corals to non-accreting turfs and fleshy algae. This topic is of particular interest because of the perceived, documented, and projected declines in coral abundances across the tropics and because of the myriad of ecosystem services that healthy coral reefs provide to coastal tropical communities. Parrotfishes in particular appear to be important for promoting coral recruitment, because they scrape away bare patches on the substrate creating suitable settlement habitat for coral larvae. Because of this unique function and its potential to influence long-term coral reef resilience, there have been many appeals from the scientific community for the conservation of parrotfishes. In terrestrial systems the interactions between the spatial patterns of grazing and the spatial patterns of primary producers have been well explored, but we know less about the fine-scale spatial behaviors of individual coral reef herbivores and how these behaviors influence reef benthic dynamics. There is evidence from spatially explicit models of herbivore foraging behavior that the spatial patterns of feeding by individual herbivores may have a significant impact on the long-term outcomes of coral-algal competition. However, there are multiple drivers that have been identified as influential to the spatial behaviors of parrotfishes and there is no current consensus as to what the primary driver is. In the first chapter of this thesis, we explore the relative influences of competition, predation, and resource abundance on the short-term space use patterns and feeding rates of Chlorurus sordidus, an abundant and widespread Pacific parrotfish. We characterized the foraging behaviors of these fish across sites that vary strongly in the presence of piscivorous predators and herbivorous competitors. We found that feeding rates are mainly influenced by direct interference competition and chronic predation risk and that short-term space use is mainly influenced by exploitative competition from the herbivore community. We found little evidence that acute predator presence has any influence on the short-term diurnal foraging behaviors of these fish, even where predators are large, diverse, and abundant. This provides insight into how foraging behaviors may be affected with changing herbivore and piscivore populations, for instance within a Marine Protected Area. In the second chapter of this thesis we evaluated the movement patterns of Chlorurus microrhinos, a large-bodied Pacific parrotfish, across multiple spatial and temporal scales to determine what biological and environmental driver influence space use patterns at each scale. We found evidence for the influences of reproduction and oceanographic conditions, habitat features, predation, resource abundance and competition, however these drivers operated at varying spatial and temporal scales to influence the movement behaviors of these parrotfish. Large-scale movement was driven by oceanographic conditions that influenced the spatial and temporal patterns of reproductive events, as well as night sheltering behavior that was likely related to habitat selection to mediate predation risk. Fine scale movement patterns appeared to be strongly related to resource abundance and competition. We found that measures of movement and the emergent patterns between movement and these drivers depend heavily on the scale of study.",,,
63,An Expectancy Violations Theory and Social Identity Approach to Understanding Normative Deviance in Online Communities,"Deviance from normative behavior is not only prevalent in offline interactions, but those that take place online as well. Several theories have sought to address the notion of deviant behavior, but have done so with a focus on either individual or group-level behavior. In online contexts identities can easily switch (i.e., be made salient at either an individual level or a group level), and existing theorizing on deviant behavior does not take into account this identity salience as a factor in responding to deviance. The current study explores deviance from the lens of expectancy violations theory (an individual-level theory) and social identity approaches (a group-level perspective) simultaneously. A key notion in expectancy violation theory is also how individuals respond to ambiguous deviance through assessing the reward value of the deviant, which has not been explored with a social identity approach. To determine the effect of identity salience, type of deviance, and reward on perceptions of deviant behavior a 2 (primed identity: group, personal) x 2 (type of deviance: ambiguous, negative) x 2 (reward value: high, low) between-subjects factorial design experiment was used. The study found no significant effects of group identity on perceptions of deviance for either type of deviance, nor significant effects of reward value (due to an unsuccessful manipulation). The reward value manipulation, while unsuccessful, created an opportunity to further explore the evaluation of reward in online contexts. Open-ended questions to assess how individuals evaluate reward revealed a confound with the deviance manipulation, as well as the role that trust, online platform/community, and amount of information plays in evaluation of rewardingness online. Future research directions for these two theoretical perspectives are discussed with regard to identity, deviance, and reward.",,,
65,Thai Secondary School Students' Probability Misconceptions : The Impact of Formal Instruction,"Probability is an important mathematics topic and is required for all Thai secondary school students. However, previous research found that both students and teachers often held several probability misconceptions, students had difficulties learning the topic, and teachers did not have sufficient knowledge to teach the topics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the types of probability misconceptions held by Thai secondary school students and their mathematics teachers, how the teachers implemented a nationwide inquiry-based curriculum, and how instruction impacted the students' understanding of the concepts. The participants were two grade 9 mathematics teachers and their students in four classes, 204 students in total. The data collection included lesson observations, a probability misconception pretest and posttest, and teacher interviews. The results showed that both the teachers and the students held several types of probability misconceptions. Even though the students' performance on the posttest was significantly improved after instruction, they still did not do well. The students learned knowledge on probability as evidenced in their responses on the posttest, but they were still having trouble appropriately applying the knowledge. Teachers' probability misconceptions and their understanding of probability topics affected how their students learned and understood probability.",,,
66,Total Synthesis of Tetrapetalone A,"Overall, two natural products have been involved in this project, which are palau'imide and tetrapetalone A. Three methods have been developed surrounding this project, including the SmI2-mediated cyclization, the Diels-Alder construction of meta-amino phenols, and the aldol reaction of tetramic acids. Four side projects have been generated. The aldol reaction of tetramic acids has been published. The rest three are currently being studied in our laboratory, including a new vinylation strategy, an asymmetric aldol reaction of tetramic acids, and some medicinal studies. The natural product tetrapetalone A has attracted lots of synthetic efforts since its isolation in 2003. The main project is to achieve its total synthesis in the laboratory. Our strategy features a concise preparation of the tetramic acid core, a classic Heck reaction, an aldol condensation, a changeling regioselective quaternization, a Friedel-Crafts reaction, and an oxidative dearomatization.",,,
67,Poly(Glycidyl Ether)-Based Battery Electrolytes: Correlating Polymer Properties to Ion Transport,"Next, we examine one of the best performing PGEs, poly(allyl glycidyl ether) PAGE, PAGE was shown to have peak conductivities at [O]/[Li] = 16, with sigma > 3x10-5 S/cm at 25C and > 5x10 -4 at 80C. Below 60C, PAGE has a conductivity that is 10--100 times higher than that of PEO at equivalent salt concentrations with this disparity in conductivities between PAGE and PEO increasing with decreasing temperature. In addition, the synthetic versatility of allyl glycidyl ether as a building block is demonstrated by the preparation and evaluation of various AGE-EO macromolecular architectures that show superior performance to both PAGE and PEO by utilizing copolymerization and thiolene coupling chemistry. We have synthesized a library of structurally similar polyethers, poly(glycidyl ether)s (PGEs), by anionic polymerization with controlled molecular weight and polydispersity index. Polymer electrolytes were prepared with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) at a molar ratio of [O]/[Li] = 16. Significantly, no correlation between glass transition temperature or room temperature viscosity and ionic conductivity over the range 20--80C could be established. This observation indicates that ion transport is not directly correlated to segmental polymer dynamics, and that the polymer dynamics may not be limiting the ionic conductivity in these amorphous polymer electrolytes. Similar to conventional small molecule organic electrolytes, the ionic conductivity increases with the dielectric constant (epsilon) of the parent polymers over the range epsilon = 4.8--6.0. This suggests that synthetic efforts to create highly conductive polymer electrolytes should focus on increasing the dielectric constant of the parent polymeric material. Lithium polymer batteries offer a number of advantages to standard lithium ion batteries, including an all-solid state structure, increased safety, and the potential to be combined with lithium metal anodes for increased energy density over lithium intercalation anodes. However, the low-temperature (<80C) ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes has remained a major limitation over the past 40 years of academic investigation into polymer electrolytes. Progress in understanding strategies for systematic improvement in ionic conductivity has been dominated a single polymer for elucidating structure-property relationships in ionic conducting polymeric solids, i.e., poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). Finally, composite polymer electrolytes combining PGEs with nanoporous polycarbonate membranes were prepared. These systems were found to have increasing ionic conductivities with decreasing pore size, up to 50 times greater than bulk PGEs. This effect was observed in polycarbonate membranes but not porous anodic aluminum oxide, suggesting that the surface chemistry of the membranes plays a strong role and could be further tailored to optimized composite electrolytes for next generation lithium ion batteries.",,,
68,Collective Expression : Audience Response Synthesis using a Symbolic Audience Model,"From Marcel Duchamp's notion of The Creative Act, to Experiments in Art and Technology's Pepsi Pavilion, to Myron Krueger's assertion ""Response is the Medium"", the paradigm of spectator participation in interactive art presents a challenging problem of metacreation to artists. With emerging perceptual user interfaces and participatory sensing technologies providing multimodal data streams from an audience, the state-of-the-art creative strategies lack a meta-level organization of audience responses. Synthesis of new interactive experiences and narratives using audience sensing interfaces requires an abstract audience representation. The absence of such abstract audience representation could be characterized as a lack of models concerning reciprocal actions between artworks and audiences in interactive art. This dissertation contextualizes the problem of metacreation through an original survey of the pioneering works using crowd-sourced sensing in interactive art practice, electronic music composition, human computer interaction, and ubiquitous computing. It addresses the significance of abstract audience representation in creative process through systems thinking, and provides a novel Symbolic Audience Model as the engine of the Audience Response Synthesis (ARS). Demonstrated by software implementations and interactive artworks, ARS considers humans as samplers and provides a meta-level technique for synthesis using the audience data, with an aim to fully exploit the creative potential provided by the emerging ecosystems of mobile and wearable sensing. The result is an analysis of the author's practice that yields an unique creative strategy: Collective Expression. Collective Expression manifests data with its emergent properties as a new language for crowd-based interactive artworks. This dissertation concludes with the applicability of ARS in synthesis of new interactive experiences using audience responses, and outlines the requirements of a model for multi-scale emergent behaviors to guide further investigation in expressiveness using ARS.",,,
69,Learning Approaches to Analog and Mixed Signal Verification and Analysis,"In this dissertation, we focus on addressing various problems related to the design automation of analog and mixed signal circuits. Analog circuits are typically highly specialized and fined tuned to fit the desired specifications for any given system reducing the reusability of circuits from design to design. This hinders the advancement of automating various aspects of analog design, test, and layout. At the core of many automation techniques, simulations, or data collection are required. Unfortunately, for some complex analog circuits, a single simulation may take many days. This prohibits performing any type of behavior characterization or verification of the circuit. This leads us to the first fundamental problem with the automation of analog devices. How can we reduce the simulation cost while maintaining the robustness of transistor level simulations? As analog circuits can vary vastly from one design to the next and are hardly ever comprised of standard library based building blocks, the second fundamental question is how to create automated processes that are general enough to be applied to all or most circuit types? Finally, what circuit characteristics can we utilize to enhance the automation procedures? The proposed dependency based partitioning of large analog circuits in the time domain allows for fast identification of highly sensitive transistors as well as provides a natural division of circuit components. Modeling analog circuits in the time domain with this partitioning technique and SVM learning algorithms allows for very fast transient behavior predictions, three orders of magnitude faster than traditional simulators, while maintaining 95% accuracy. Analog verification can be explored through a reduction of simulation time by utilizing the partitions, information and complexity measures, and input space reduction. Behavioral models are created using supervised learning techniques for detected primitive elements. We will show the effectiveness of the method on four analog circuits where the simulation time is decreased by 55--75%. Utilizing the reduced simulation method, critical nodes can be found quickly and efficiently. The nodes found using this method match those found by an experienced layout engineer, but are detected automatically given the design and input specifications. The technique is further extended to find the tolerance of transistors to both process variation and power supply fluctuation. This information allows for corrections in layout overdesign or guidance in placing noise reducing components such as guard rings or decoupling capacitors. The proposed approaches significantly reduce the simulation time required to perform the tasks traditionally, maintain high accuracy, and can be automated. (Abstract shortened by UMI.). The objective of this dissertation is to explore these questions and provide suitable evidence that they can be answered. We begin by exploring machine learning techniques to model the design space using minimal simulation effort. Circuit partitioning is employed to reduce the complexity of the machine learning algorithms. Using the same partitioning algorithm we further explore the behavior characterization of analog circuits undergoing process variation. The circuit partitioning is general enough to be used by any CMOS based analog circuit. The ideas and learning gained from behavioral modeling during behavior characterization are used to improve the simulation through event propagation, input space search, complexity and information measurements. The reduction of the input space and behavioral modeling of low complexity, low information primitive elements reduces the simulation time of large analog and mixed signal circuits by 50--75%. The method is extended and applied to assist in analyzing analog circuit layout. All of the proposed methods are implemented on analog circuits ranging from small benchmark circuits to large, highly complex and specialized circuits. There are many automated characterization, test, and verification methods used in practice for digital circuits, but analog and mixed signal circuits suffer from long simulation times brought on by transistor-level analysis. Due to the substantial amount of simulations required to properly characterize and verify an analog circuit, many undetected issues manifest themselves in the manufactured chips. Creating behavioral models, a circuit abstraction of analog components assists in reducing simulation time which allows for faster exploration of the design space. Traditionally, creating behavioral models for non-linear circuits is a manual process which relies heavily on design knowledge for proper parameter extraction and circuit abstraction. Manual modeling requires a high level of circuit knowledge and often fails to capture critical effects stemming from block interactions and second order device effects. For this reason, it is of interest to extract the models directly from the SPICE level descriptions so that these effects and interactions can be properly captured. As the devices are scaled, process variations have a more profound effect on the circuit behaviors and performances. Creating behavior models from the SPICE level descriptions, which include input parameters and a large process variation space, is a non-trivial task.",,,
70,A Kernel Module for Pulse-Coupled Time Synchronization in Sensor Networks,"Bio-inspired synchronization strategies in wireless ad-hoc sensor networks based on pulse-coupled oscillators have been favorably received as an appealing alternative to traditional message-based synchronization strategies. Their inherent scalability, simplicity, statelessness and lack of hierarchy render pulse-coupled synchronization attractive in wireless ad-hoc networks. However favorable as they are, implementing pulse-coupled techniques towards timing synchronization in a sensor network has its own challenges due to several factors, both internal and external to the algorithm. Internal factors can relate to the level of computation employed by the algorithm. External factors relate to the constraints of the computing platform within which the algorithm is applied. In this thesis, I set out to investigate these factors and characterize the working of such an algorithm. I present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Linux-based kernel module, geared towards easy deployment and usage, that supports pulse-coupled time synchronization.",,,
71,Alternative Approaches to Group IV Thermoelectric Materials,"In the pursuit of energy efficiency, there is a demand for systems capable of recovering waste heat. A temperature gradient across a thermoelectric material results in the thermal diffusion of charge carriers from the hot side to the cold side, giving rise to a voltage that can be used to convert waste heat to electricity. Silicon germanium (SiGe) alloys are the standard materials used for thermoelectric generators at high temperatures. A phosphorus-doped oxide can yield n-type Si1- xGex; however, the current processing method introduces a background boron content that compensates ~10% of the donor impurities and limits the thermoelectric power factor. Spark plasma sintering of the nano-Si1-xGe x yields a heterogeneous alloy with thermal conductivity lower than that of the hot pressed homogeneous alloy due to a reduction in the average crystallite size. Magnesiothermic reduction in the presence of molten salts allows some control over crystallite growth and the extent of Si-Ge alloying. We report an alternative method for preparing p-type Si1- xGex alloys from a boron-doped silica-germania nanocomposite. This is the first demonstration of the thermoelectric properties of SiGe-based thermoelectrics prepared at temperatures below the alloy's melting point through a magnesiothermic reduction of the (SiO 2)1-x(GeO2) x. We observe a thermoelectric power factor that is competitive with the literature record for the conventionally prepared SiGe. The large grain size in our hot pressed SiGe limits the thermoelectric figure of merit to 0.5 at 800 for an optimally doped p-type Si80Ge 20 alloy.",,,
73,Luminous and Dark Matter in Early-type Galaxies,"Three open problems in our understanding of early-type galaxies are 1) identifying the process(es) responsible for their rapid size evolution, 2) accurately constraining the stellar IMF and its variations in the population, 3) measuring the density profile of their dark matter halo. We use strong lensing as the main diagnostic tool to address these issues. We first dissected a massive elliptical galaxy in its stellar and dark matter components, measuring both its IMF and the inner slope of the dark matter halo. We then collected a sample of 45 strong lenses in the redshift interval 0.2 < z < 0.8 and used them, in combination with lenses from other surveys, to measure the slope of the total density profile, the stellar IMF and the dark matter mass in the population of massive early-type galaxies, and their time evolution. Finally, we used our measurements of the evolution of the density slope to test a galaxy growth scenario based on purely dissipationless mergers. Our main results are: the stellar IMF of massive early-type galaxies is significantly heavier than that of the Milky Way and correlates with galaxy mass; the dark matter halo has a steep slope in at least one system; more compact galaxies have less dark matter than their extended counterparts at fixed redshift and stellar mass; early-type galaxies evolve while keeping the slope of their total density profile approximately constant. This last result cannot be reproduced with purely dissipationless mergers, therefore a little amount of dissipation is required.",,,
74,The Parietal Cortex and Recognition Memory : Activity is Modulated by Changes in Task Demands,"These results are difficult to explain with an episodic buffer account of parietal activity. Instead, the results point to a more indirect role of parietal involvement in memory retrieval and are the most in line with the idea of this area representing the subjective awareness that can accompany successful retrieval, particularly during recollection. When these results are compared to results from neuropsychology, an extra-mnemonic role for the parietal cortex, particularly one associated with the subjective experience of retrieved content, appears to be the most parsimonious explanation of the patient findings. However, a subjective awareness account of parietal activity cannot adequately explain all of the findings from the literature, and most likely is only part of the story. The parietal cortex is an extremely heterogeneous area, both in structural and functional connectivity. The full story of the parietal cortex's role in memory retrieval will most likely be explained with a variety of theories. Increased levels of spatial segregation of the parietal cortex into distinct functional sub-regions will most likely reveal a myriad of functional roles that this region is playing during the complex cognitive process that is memory retrieval. These findings are specifically difficult for theories that assume this region is directly related to memory retrieval (i.e. the episodic buffer account), which assume this activity is necessary for successful retrieval to occur. The purpose of the experiments described in this dissertation is to test whether parietal activations are modulated by task demands that should not affect the amount of episodic content retrieved. These task demands include modifying the way retrieval states are operationalized and varying the base rates of studied items presented at test. Although these procedural changes should affect extra-mnemonic cognitive processes, there is no reason to assume they should affect the amount of mnemonic information retrieved. Results from these studies in fact do show a modulation of both dorsal and ventral lateral parietal activations based on these procedural manipulations. Recently there has been an increased interest in the lateral parietal cortex's role in successful memory retrieval. Several theories have been put forth to explain this phenomenon including the idea that this region plays a direct role in memory retrieval, temporarily storing episodic content until a decision can be made. Other explanations report a more indirect role of the parietal cortex during memory retrieval. Some of these theories include modulations of attentional systems that may guide memory retrieval or representations of subjective awareness of one's memories. According to these theories, parietal activations may assist successful memory retrieval, but are not necessary for it to occur. Although this region is consistently found to be active when memories are successfully retrieved, these results were initially difficult to reconcile with reports from neuropsychology, which show a lack of severe memory impairment when damage to this region occurs.",,,
75,Total Synthesis of Bioactive Marine Natural Products Inspired by Enolate Chemistry & Developments of New Haloalkylations via Soft Enolizations,"The first part of this dissertation focuses on the synthetic studies directed toward the synthesis of nuphar thiaspirane alkaloids. The main drive of this effort is to allow access to each of the four classes of nuphar thiaspirane alkaloids. During these studies, a new procedure for the generation of tetrasubstituted tetrahydrothiophenes was developed. This method has been further applied for a late-stage Stevens rearrangement to generate each class of nuphar thiaspirane alkaloids from common intermediates. Marine natural products have long served as promising compounds and scaffolds for new therapeutic agents; however, their utilization is often extremely limited due to poor availability from natural sources and their molecular complexity. Hence, synthetic investigation of utilizing innovative techniques offers shortcuts in the production of such agents and modification. Studies directed toward the synthesis of marine natural products and their scaffolds inspire the development of new, efficient, and economical methods that are useful for medicinal research and for the synthesis of new pharmaceuticals and organic compounds. The final part describes a new procedure for the generation of syn-1,3-diols, which addresses both stereo- and regiocontrol in the rhenium catalyzed transposition of allylic alcohols. The third part describes the development of new and exciting chemical transformations revolving around haloalkylations of N-acyl oxazolidinones via Group IVa metal enolates by both radical and electrophilic methods. These studies include: mechanistic eludication of trichloromethylations, perfluoroalkylation and trifluoromethylation methodology development, and a generic alpha-fluorination method. The second part describes the total synthesis of the marine natural product (+)-brevisamide. The art and science of natural product total synthesis has become increasingly more associated with the various principles of the ""economies"" of synthesis. Evaluation of protecting group use serves as one metric of synthetic efficiency and can provide a framework for developing a synthesis plan. A new protecting-group-free synthesis of, the marine cyclic ether alkaloid, brevisamide was completed.",,,
76,"Bio-inspired, subwavelength surface structures to control reflectivity, transmission, and scattering in the infrared","Controlling the reflection of visible and infrared (IR) light at interfaces is extremely important to increase the power efficiency and performance of optics, electro-optical and (thermo)photovoltaic systems. The eye of the moth has evolved subwavelength protuberances that increase light transmission into the eye tissue and prevent reflection. The subwavelength protuberances effectively grade the refractive index from that of air (n=1) to that of the tissue (n=1.4), making the interface gradual, suppressing reflection. In theory, the moth-eye (ME) structures can be implemented with any material platform to achieve an antireflectance effect by scaling the pitch and size of protuberances for the wavelength range of interest. The effect of structure height and aspect ratio on transmittance and scattering is explored, with discussion on experimental techniques and effective medium theory (EMT). The highest aspect ratio structures (AR = 9.4) achieved peak single-side transmittance of 98%, with >85% transmission for lambda = 7--30 microns. A detailed photon balance constructed by transmission, forward scattering, specular reflection and diffuse reflection measurements to quantify optical losses due to near-field effects will be discussed. In addition, angle-dependent transmission measurements showed that moth-eye structures provide superior antireflective properties compared to unstructured interfaces over a wide angular range (0--60 incidence). The methods presented here to fabricate quasi-ordered ME structures provide a general platform for creating antireflective structures in many different materials, devices, and bandwidths. Furthermore, understanding the relationship between protuberance shape, height, aspect ratio, etc. and performance (antireflection, scattering loss, etc.) can guide the design of antireflective surfaces for different applications (for example, in certain applications, large amounts of forward scattering is desired, e.g. photovoltaics). Finally, subwavelength ME structures are incorporated on a Si substrate to enhance the absorption of near infrared (NIR) light in PtSi films to increase Schottky-barrier detector efficiency. Absorbance enhancement of 70--200% in the lambda =1--2.5 micron range is demonstrated in crystalline PtSi films grown via electron beam evaporation of Pt and subsequent vacuum annealing. Low total reflectance (<10%) was measured in ME films, demonstrating the efficacy of the moth eye effect. Effective medium theory and transfer matrix calculations show that the large absorption enhancement at short wavelengths is partly due to light trapping, which increases the effective optical path length in PtSi. The demonstrated structures are promising candidates for efficient PtSi/p-Si Schottky barrier diode detectors in the NIR. Results further suggest a general method for relatively low-cost absorption enhancement of backside-illuminated detectors based on a wide variety of infrared absorptive materials. In this work, a bio-inspired, scalable and substrate-independent surface modification protocol was developed to realize broadband antireflective structures based on the moth-eye principle. Quasi-ordered ME arrays were fabricated in IR relevant materials using a colloidal lithography method to achieve highly efficient, omni-directional transmission of mid and far infrared (IR) radiation.",,,
77,Three Essays on the Implications and Impacts of Information on Resources and the Environment,"Little is known about how heterogeneity in users with varying stakes in a resource impacts withdrawal behavior. To address this gap in knowledge, chapter two presents a CPR game incorporating heterogeneous agents as individuals facing different penalties when a threshold is crossed. The experiment was structured to determine how different types of individuals respond to varying levels of information and enforcement. Results determined how this heterogeneity impacts withdrawal behavior and specify whether it requires us to modify previous policy recommendations for the management of a threshold CPR given heterogeneous withdrawal behavior. I determined that the absence of coherent approaches to natural resource use resulted in a sub-optimal economic outcome, lower earnings and a shorter CPR lifespan. I found that punishment can be an effective tool in reducing resource use and increasing common-pool longevity, but has the opposite effect when announced targets or policies are unenforced. In chapter three, I address the ""Challenges to Measuring, Monitoring, and Addressing the Cumulative Impacts of Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining (ASGM) in Ecuador."" Mercury and other waste from ASGM in the environment create many environmental health and economics costs, the future impacts of which are not fully known. These are discussed in the context of ongoing, unresolved issues including efforts to address trans-boundary water pollution, management of mining waste, and conflicts regarding enforcement of existing regulations and policies. There is often discrepancy over how best to calculate future costs, largely over how to weight the present costs versus the future costs (the discount rate). Due to the nature of the fragmented and difficult to regulate ASGM market, I advocated for information-based strategies including educating miners regarding the risks they face and helping to identify and avoid inefficient processing plants. This dissertation consists of three separate papers in experimental and environmental economics, each demonstrating the benefits of effective communication and the detrimental effect of present-biased preferences on the environment. As a result of policy makers' bias for the present, they may struggle to resolve their conflict between current resource consumption and resource conservation. This is often exhibited through inconsistent and constantly changing environmental and natural resource management policies. In chapter one, I discuss the results of my laboratory experiment which was developed to determine the impact of information uncertainty and lack of policy enforcement on the lifespan of threshold Common-Pool Resources (CPRs). I found that providing individuals with reliable information and allowing individuals to develop beliefs results in both economic growth and preservation of the Common-Pool Resource (CPR). Based on these experimental results and in combination with real-world policy observations, I recommend not revealing a true threshold for a CPR. Since policy makers are faced with a bias for the present and their policies are likely to change, a firm policy today is likely to become one that will be readjusted tomorrow. In the best case of announcing a policy target, there was no gain over letting an individual develop their own beliefs. In the worst case, individuals faced a significant loss of earnings and a shorter CPR lifespan. The findings of this study have implications for many CPR and environmental management policies around the globe, as well as other areas of government regulation where we see changing targets.",,,
78,A Regional-Scale Ocean Health Index for Brazil,"Brazil has one of the largest and fastest growing economies and one of the largest coastlines in the world, making human use and enjoyment of coastal and marine resources of fundamental importance to the country. Integrated assessments of ocean health are needed to understand the condition of a range of benefits that humans derive from marine systems and to evaluate where attention should be focused to improve the health of these systems. Here we describe the first such assessment for Brazil at both national and state levels. We applied the Ocean Health Index framework, which evaluates ten public goals for healthy oceans. Despite refinements of input data and model formulations, the national score of 60 (out of 100) was highly congruent with the previous global assessment for Brazil of 62. Variability in scores among coastal states was most striking for goals related to mariculture, protected areas, tourism, and clean waters. Extractive goals, including Food Provision, received low scores relative to habitat-related goals, such as Biodiversity. This study demonstrates the applicability of the Ocean Health Index at a regional scale, and its usefulness in highlighting existing data and knowledge gaps and identifying key policy and management recommendations. To improve Brazil's ocean health, this study suggests that future actions should focus on: enhancing fisheries management, expanding marine protected areas, and monitoring coastal habitats.",,,
79,The Spyglass of the Demon Optician : Uncanny Perception in the Drama of Maeterlinck and Strindberg,"I contend that in conceptually unifying the spectacle onstage with the perceptual experience of the spectator, this ""phenomenological"" theatrical tradition attempts to overcome the divide between the stage and the audience by siting the performance in the mind of the spectator, thus converting the philosophical metaphor of consciousness-as-theater to a model in which theater is an extension of consciousness. Placing the work within a historical and cultural context, this dissertation employs the philosopher Jacques Ranciere's conceptualization of regimes of art to reconsider the role that Maeterlinck and Strindberg's groundbreaking drama played in establishing theater as a particular ""distribution of the sensible"" and interrogates the politics of the formal strategies that attempt to manipulate the sensory experience of the spectator. In its conclusion, it examines the possibility that some of the ways in which the capacities and limits of theater as a discipline are currently defined in Europe and North America---derived largely from the innovations of playwrights like Maeterlinck and Strindberg---are historically contingent and open to reorganization, not only through contemporary practice that eschews the dramatic text, but also through a consideration of the possibilities that a radically revised and expanded textual practice might offer. This dissertation examines the ways in which the plays of Maurice Maeterlinck and August Strindberg radically transformed the theatrical landscape through their emphasis on the sensory experience of the spectator. I argue that their plays signal a reorganization of the capacities of European and North American theater that finds a useful analog in the development of phenomenology and use phenomenology as a lens through which to consider their work and a subsequent tradition of plays that highlight the sensory experience of the spectator, including those of William Butler Yeats, Gertrude Stein, and Richard Foreman. In particular, I mobilize the discourse surrounding the concept of the uncanny that originates in Sigmund Freud's essay ""The Uncanny"" to consider both thematic elements and the way in which the spectator's sensory experience is emphasized and manipulated.",,,
80,Fault-tolerant superconducting qubits,"For quantum computing to become viable, the inherently fallible nature of qubits must be overcome with quantum error correction (QEC). QEC requires coherent qubits, in a configuration compatible with a given QEC scheme, and quantum logic operations with sufficiently low error. In this thesis, we perform a series of targeted experiments to achieve these goals on a path toward realizing the surface code QEC scheme. We first develop the Xmon variant of the transmon qubit, a highly coherent, planar, and frequency tunable superconducting qubit. With coherence demonstrated, we build an array of five Xmon qubits in a configuration compatible with the surface code, and demonstrate quantum logic operations with sufficiently low error to employ the surface code. These logic gates are characterized with randomized benchmarking, a protocol for determining gate error. We find applications of randomized benchmarking beyond the intended use in gate optimization and decoherence characterization, in addition to exploring the fundamental assumptions of randomized benchmarking. Lastly, we build a nine qubit Xmon transmon array and demonstrate correction of environmental bit-flip errors in a precursor to the surface code.",,,
81,Highly Scaled InP/InGaAs DHBTs Beyond 1 THz Bandwidth,"This work examines the efforts pursued to extend the bandwidth of InP-based DHBTs above 1 THz. Aggressive lithographic and epitaxial scaling of key device dimensions and simultaneous reduction of contact resistivities have enabled increased RF bandwidths by reduction of device RC and transit delays. A fabrication process for forming base electrodes and base/collector mesas of highly scaled transistors has been developed that exploits superior resolution (10nm) and alignment (<30nm) of electron beam lithography. Ultra-low resistance, thermally stable base contacts are critical for extended fmax bandwidth: a novel dual-deposition base metalization technique is presented that removes contaminating lithographic processes from the formation of the base contact, thereby enabling low resistivity contacts (4 &ohm;-microm2) to ultra-thin base layers (20 nm). The composite base metal stack exploits an ultra-thin layer of platinum that controllably reacts with base, yielding low contact resistivity, as well as a thick refractory diffusion barrier which permits stable operation at high current densities and elevated temperatures. Reduction in emitter-base surface leakage and subsequent increase of current gain was achieved by passivating emitter-base semiconductor surfaces with conformally grown ALD Al2O3. RF bandwidth limiting parasitics associated to the perimeter of highly scaled transistors have been identified and significantly reduced, among which are high sheet resistance of base electrodes, excess undercut of emitter stripes and improperly scaled base posts. At 100nm collector thickness, the breakdown voltage of the transistor BVCEO has been increased to more than 4.1V by passivating base/collector surfaces. With the technology improvements discussed, transistors with ftau of 480 GHz and fmax in excess of 1 THz have been demonstrated at 200nm emitter width and 80nm single-sided base contact width. Transistors at the same emitter width, but 30nm base contact width exhibit ftau of 550 GHz and fmax of 850 GHz. Estimations from a finite element model predict higher bandwidth on smaller footprint transistors. However, inadequacies of RF calibration structures prevent f max extraction on these devices.",,,
82,Predicting Microlensing Rates and Properties in Wide-Field Surveys,"The rates and properties of out-of-plane microlensing events have been understudied in the past. We seek to remedy this by building a simulation of galactic stars and lensing events, drawing upon numerous up-to-date sources. The resulting code is a well-verified software tool which can be adapted to simulate a wide range of potential survey strategies and parameters. It will be a useful tool for the community to optimize the design of the deep, wide-angle surveys coming on line in the next decades, such as ATLAS, Evryscope, and LSST. In the text, we provide baseline all-sky lensing properties for a deep survey.",,,
83,Direct and Indirect Contributions of Photodegradation to Litter Decomposition in a California Grassland,"First, I evaluated how photodegradation by ultraviolet (UV) radiation affected litter decomposition for two litter positions in a field experiment at Sedgwick Reserve in California. I found that photodegradation increased litter mass loss by up to 30% at positions with and without radiation exposure, suggesting UV radiation had both direct and indirect contributions to litter decay. Next, effects of UV photodegradation on litter biodegradability were examined in a laboratory experiment. Surprisingly, UV radiation in summer reduced litter biodegradability by 28% through reduction of litter N availability. This result suggests that UV radiation has both positive and negative impacts on microbial decomposition of litter. Finally, I examined impacts of UV radiation on litter chemical composition at a molecular level using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D NMR) spectroscopy. Although conventional fiber analysis showed no changes in lignin concentration, 2D NMR spectroscopy data revealed that UV radiation degraded lignin p-hydroxyphenyl units and lignin beta-aryl linkages. Furthermore, lignin degradation likely led to loss of hemicellulose through enhancing microbial decomposition. Plant litter decomposition is a fundamental ecosystem service because it regulates soil fertility, the turnover and fate of carbon and nutrients, and ultimately plant growth and productivity. Photodegradation recently has been proposed as a significant driver of litter decomposition in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. However, the mechanisms through which photodegradation contributes to litter decomposition remain poorly understood. In this dissertation, I conducted both field and laboratory experiments to test the hypothesis that photodegradation has both direct (through abiotic photochemical reactions) and indirect (through interacting with microbial decomposition) contributions to litter decomposition. The combined results demonstrate that photodegradation is an important contributor to litter decomposition processes in arid ecosystems like California grasslands. More importantly, my work suggests that photodegradation is not purely an abiotic process, as it has significant indirect contributions to litter decay through effects on microbial decomposition. Thus future empirical and modeling studies of litter decomposition must examine the interaction of abiotic and biotic processes in arid ecosystems. This work identifies major pathways through which photodegradation increases microbial decomposition of litter. It also advances our understanding of chemical mechanisms underlying photodegradation.",,,
84,Fine-Tuning Catechol Reactivity in Synthetic Polymeric Materials,"First, the effect of local environment on the adhesive, adsorptive, and metal binding behavior of catechols was investigated for both native proteins and synthetic polymeric analogues. The presence of charged cofunctionality is able to modulate the binding properties of catechols by tuning their proton affinity. This effect can be re-created by chemically modifying catechols to create electron-deficient analogues with greater acidity and a lower susceptibility to oxidation. A simple metal coordination crosslinked hydrogel model system and an interpenetrating network hydrogel were used to demonstrate that these analogues possessed clear advantages in the construction of mechanically active structures. Finally, photo-mediated patterning and deprotection strategies were used to exert spatiotemporal control over the reactivity of catechols. By selectively activating catechols, binding can be controlled and catechols protected from premature oxidation. Taken together, these strategies show that controlled catecholic reactivity can be achieved by fusing biological design principles with designed materials engineering. Furthermore, this work identifies the 3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone moiety as an especially promising functionality for metal coordination bonding in supramolecular materials. The robust, versatile attachment of mussels in the intertidal zone has motivated a large effort to create adhesives, coatings and energy dispersive materials based on the design principles of these marine organisms. Much progress has been made, but these materials frequently run up against two challenges related to the promiscuous reactivity of the catechol moiety. The first is the inability of reductionist constructs to incorporate the chemical nuances which modulate and optimize the performance of catechols. The second is the great propensity of catechols to oxidize and oligomerize under relatively benign conditions. Addressing these challenges will allow broader control and enhanced performance of catecholic moieties in synthetic systems. Two different strategies were employed to address these challenges: modulating the chemical nature of catechols, and utilizing stimuli-responsive protection chemistries.",,,
85,A Temporal Approach to Defining Place Types based on User-Contributed Geosocial Content,"Place is one of the foundational concepts on which the field of Geography has been built. Traditionally, GIScience research into place has been approached from a spatial perspective. While space is an integral feature of place, it represents only a single dimension (or a combination of three dimensions to be exact), in the complex, multidimensional concept that is place. Though existing research has shown that both spatial and thematic dimensions are valuable, time has historically been under-utilized in its ability to describe and define places and their types. The recent availability and access to user-generated geosocial content has allowed for a much deeper investigation of the temporal dimension of place. Multi-resolution temporal signatures are constructed based on these data permitting both place instances and place types to be compared through a robust set of (dis)similarity measures. The primary contribution of this work lies in demonstrating how places are defined through a better understanding of temporal user behavior. Furthermore, the results of this research present the argument that the temporal dimension is the most indicative placial dimension for classifying places by type.",,,
86,An American Religious History of Sex Education,"As religious people pushed to develop sex education, they held onto the reins as best they could. They broke ground for new ways of envisioning responsibility for sex education (expansion) with the goal of controlling moral behavior (contraction). As they pushed the movement forward, they often succeeded in adapting and molding it to their religious vision, complete with ambivalences and unexpected outcomes. In particular, I analyze historical ironies that developed around women's sexuality, religious pluralism, and abstinence. Opposition between conservative, evangelical abstinence-only advocates and liberal, secular comprehensive sexuality educators has come to characterize American sex education. This formulation has led cultural observers to conclude that ""religion"" has been primarily a restrictive force, with little attention paid to the impact of liberal religious sex educators. In this history, I argue that, before conservative religious prominence, liberals---primarily Protestants---set the tone for religion within the national movement for public sex education. I conclude that their work, which strategically combined progressive and restrictive approaches to sexuality, unintentionally laid foundations for both liberal and conservative sides of contemporary controversies over sex education. Through their involvement, liberal ministers and organizations influenced major shifts in the teaching of sexuality. I contextualize their contributions within five phases of the movement for public sex education: the roots of social hygiene education, the early institutionalization of sex education programs, and the separate developments of family life education, comprehensive sexuality education, and abstinence-only education. Taking religious influences seriously reveals new actors, themes, and strategies within each phase. To anchor the study, I focus on organizations dedicated principally to public sex education, namely the America Social Hygiene Association (ASHA) for the period prior to 1960 and the Sexuality Education and Information Council of the United States (SIECUS) for the remainder of the century. My approach shows not only how religion influenced the mainstream movement, but also how the movement impacted its religious participants, especially through their interactions with physicians, public health officials, public school teachers, and other sex educators. Encounters with medical and social scientific trends inspired strategies for adapting Christianity to a quickly changing American society. Chapter one demonstrates that liberal religion entered early sex education through the social purity and social hygiene movements that came together to form ASHA in 1914. The next chapter explores the emergence of the Young Men's Christian Association as ASHA's partner in providing moral education about sexuality within colleges, the military, and local Ys. Chapter three shows how the liberal religious influences of Anna Garlin Spencer and the Federal Council of Churches transformed ASHA's sex education into family life education beginning in 1925. The fourth chapter traces the shift from family life education to comprehensive sexuality education and the embrace of the ""new morality,"" or situation ethics, by SIECUS educators. In the final chapter, I address struggles between two competing versions of sex education after the emergence of abstinence-only education in the 1980s as an evangelical replacement for comprehensive curricula.",,,
87,Realization and Formal Analysis of Asynchronous Pulse Communication Circuits,"A 5Gbps radiation-hardened link, targeted at use in detector modules at the LHC, will be presented. This application presents a special challenge due to both very high radiation levels (1+MGy life time dose) and the demand for minimum resource (area, power, cable cost) use. The presented link, realized in 130nm technology, is unique in that it has low power (~50mW end to end) and very low area 0.12mm2 including electrostatic discharge protection, and I/O amplifiers. Due to its asynchronous construction and the gate design style, the link has essentially zero power dissipation when idle, and enters and exits its idle state with no delay. In addition to the construction of the link, this presentation covers the design and analysis methodology that can be used to create other asynchronous communication circuits. The methodology achieves higher performance than conventional static technology but needs only a reasonable design effort using tools and strategies that are only mildly extended versions of those familiar to digital static designers. It is used to construct the serializer, deserializer, and self-test circuitry for the presented link. In this case, a 5Gbps SER/DES and a 2GHz parallel pseudo-random number generator are implemented in 130nm CMOS technology using a gate design style that does not dissipate static power. This work presents an approach to constructing asynchronous pulsed communication circuits. These circuits use small delay elements to introduce a gate level sense of time, removing the need for either a clock or handshaking signal to be part of a high-speed communication link. This construction method allows the creation of links with better than normal jitter tolerance, allowing for simple circuit architectures that can easily be made robust to radiation induced soft error.",,,
88,Jewish Tourism to the Occupied Palestinian Territories and its Effects on Diaspora Identities and Politics,"The deployment of tourism to strengthen diaspora ties is well documented, however sociologists have yet to examine the use of tourism to complicate transnational diaspora allegiances. Jewish tourism to the Palestinian Territories offers a compelling case to study this growing trend, as more non-Israeli Jews are foregoing standard trips to Israel and instead visiting sites in Israel/Palestine that challenge dominant Zionist narratives. Using a mixed methods approach that combines pre/post tour surveys with longitudinal in-depth interviews, I investigate how this emerging form of tourism shapes participants' political views, identities, and activism. I find that tourists often experience significant ideological tension when they criticize a base country, while still seeing themselves as part of its national collective. However, rather than compel participants to sever their ties to the base country (Israel), this tension can actually lead to increased engagement on the part of the diaspora member, even when it is in the form of activism directed against the state. Jewish tourism to the Palestinian Territories appears to facilitate this kind of diasporic tension, while also causing participants to ""humanize"" a previously demonized population, Palestinians. Though such ""humanization"" does not always lead to overt changes in political views, it influences participants' willingness to embrace counter national narratives. These results suggest that this unique form of ""homeland"" tourism can engender political criticism within diaspora populations, while simultaneously solidifying transnational ties. It is this contradictory process - solidifying ties to a base country while promoting political criticism of it - that I discuss in my thesis.",,,
89,III-As/N-Polar III-N Wafer-Bonded Heterojunctions and Their Implementation in Current Aperture Vertical Electron Transistors,"In light of the notable advantages offered from the N-polar III-N materials in wafer-bonded CAVETs (or BAVETs), all BAVETs fabricated and analyzed throughout this dissertation are based on the N-polar III-N. In comparison to the past Ga-polar BAVETs, the first functional N-polar BAVET showed a markedly higher current, but it exhibited most of the same problems observed from the Ga-polar BAVETs, such as the anomalously high saturation voltage, finite turn-on voltage, and high gate leakage. By performing elaborated series studies on the doping in the gate heterobarrier, thickness of the added InGaN interlayer and gate electrode geometry, the abovementioned problems seen in the BAVETs could be better understood and partly addressed. Finally, in the latest generation BAVET designed with all of the key observations taken into account, the turn-on voltage, which has been a persistent problem observed from the majority of the functional wafer-bonded transistors studied so far, was successfully eliminated, thus showing promise in expanding the use of wafer-bonding into the field of electronic devices. Acknowledging the potential of wafer-bonding in expanding the design space in the field of electronics, a concept of a wafer-bonded transistor consisting of a III-As channel (with superior carrier transport properties) and III-N drain (with very high breakdown voltage) has been developed with the aim of simultaneously achieving both the high-frequency and high-power performances within a single device. The transistor design selected for the wafer-bonded heterojunctions of III-As/III-N is the current aperture vertical electron transistor (CAVET), from which the regrown AlGaN/GaN channel with a two-dimensional electron gas is substituted with a wafer-bonded InGaAs channel. Wafer-bonding is a novel technique which enables realizations of heterostructures consisting of heteroepitaxy-incompatible materials with a large lattice mismatch. Since its discovery, wafer-bonding has continued to expand its impact in diverse applications related to the field of semiconductors---from silicon-on-insulator wafers to hybrid III-V/Si photonics to many more. Likewise, if high-quality wafer-bonded heterostructures with unique combinations of materials can be successfully demonstrated, it is evident that their implementation in electronic devices will result in several breakthroughs. This dissertation work aspired to demonstrate that---with continued research efforts invested in this field---the extra degree of freedom in the materials design offered by wafer-bonding may enable realizations of cutting edge electronic devices in the future, hence expanding the design space that is currently bound by heteroepitaxy.",,,
90,Efficient Similarity Search with Cache-Conscious Data Traversal,"We have developed a fast two-stage partition-based approach for all-pairs similarity search which incorporates static partitioning, optimized load balancing, and cache-conscious data traversal. Static partitioning places dissimilar documents into different groups to eliminate unnecessary comparison between their content. To overcome the challenges introduced by skewed distribution of data partition sizes and irregular dissimilarity relationship in large datasets, we conduct computation load balancing for partitioned similarity search, with competitiveness analysis. These techniques can improve performance by one to two orders of magnitude with less unnecessary I/O and data communication and better load balance. We also discuss how to further accelerate similarity search by incorporating incremental computing and approximation methods such as Locality Sensitive Hashing. Because of data sparsity and irregularity, accessing feature vectors in memory for runtime comparison incurs significant overhead in modern memory hierarchy. We have designed and implemented cache-conscious algorithms to improve runtime efficiency in similarity search. The idea of optimizing data layout and traversal patterns is also applied to the search result ranking problem in runtime with multi-tree ensemble models. Similarity search is important for many data-intensive applications to identify a set of similar objects. Examples of such applications include near-duplicate detection and clustering, collaborative filtering for similarity-based recommendations, search query suggestion, and data cleaning. Conducting similarity search is a time-consuming process, especially when a massive amount of data is involved, and when all pairs are compared. Previous work has used comparison filtering, inverted indexing, and parallel accumulation of partial intermediate results to expedite its execution. However, shuffling intermediate results can incur significant communication overhead as data scales up.",,,
91,Search for supersymmetry at CMS in events with b-tagged jets and missing transverse energy at 8 TeV / by Kristen Flowers,"This dissertation presents results from a search for physics beyond the Standard Model, using 19.39 pb-1 of data collected by the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider, during its 2012 operation at _ s=8 TeV. It focuses on models of supersymmetry that lead to final states with multiple jets, especially those from b-quark decay, and a large amount of missing transverse momentum. The amounts of background from top-quark, W+jets, Z  nu[special character omitted], and multi-jet production are determined from data-driven techniques. In particular, this includes a novel estimation of the ETmiss spectrum from semi-leptonic tt decay, which takes advantage of the precise knowledge of the W boson polarization. Predicted yields are consistent with simulated Standard Model processes and the observed data. Since no evidence of new physics is observed, limits are placed on the rate of gluino pair production to a final state with four b-quarks and two neutralinos. This process is excluded at 95% CL for a gluino with mass 1225 GeV and a neutralino with mass up to 350 GeV.",,,
92,Towards a Nonviolent Alternative for the Black Hole Information Paradox,"In the semiclassical approximation, quantum field theory suggests that black holes eventually evaporate in a manner largely independent of their internal structure. Doing so, however, leads to a violation of unitarity of quantum mechanics, rendering the system inconsistent. One possible resolution is soft violations of locality in the near horizon region. The first consistency check is whether such a proposal can actually get the information out. Using quantum information techniques, a large class of evolutions into paired states is ruled out. More generally, information transfer can be characterized by the mutual information of a specially prepared state. Minimizing this quantity saturates a subadditivity inequality, leading to ""subspace transfer""; maximizing it generically leads to an enhanced particle flux. Using the tools of effective field theory, one can then try to model the nonlocality as arising from an effective source localized near the horizon. To get information out at the right rate, this source must have a characteristic size. The horizon is altered, but nonviolent. This model also naturally accommodates black hole mining, avoiding a potential flaw. Having passed important consistency checks, nonviolent nonlocality is a viable solution to the information paradox.",,,
93,Throughput and Delay on the Packet Switched Internet (A Cross-Disciplinary Approach),"These two characteristics determine the Internet's ability to deliver objects across communication paths. Improving these two characteristics (bandwidth and delay) increase the ability of the Internet to deliver objects and thus improve the Internet's capability to deliver life improving services. To accomplish this goal I present projects along three areas of effort. These three areas of effort are: (1) Increase the ability of applications operating in challenging conditions to achieve their fair share of bandwidth. (2) Synthesize knowledge required to address the effort to reduce delay. (3) Develop protocols that reduce delay encountered in the communications paths of the Internet. The overarching purpose of this dissertation is to improve the Internet's ability to deliver life improving services. I have further divided this purpose into two goals. To improve the ability of applications operating in challenging network conditions to gain their fair share of the bandwidth resources and to reduce the delay with which these services are delivered. Every service delivered by the Internet consists of Internet objects that are delivered through communication paths across the Internet. The delivery of these objects is defined by the two characteristics; Throughput and delay. Throughput determines how much of an object can be delivered over a period of time and delay determines how long it takes to deliver an object. In this dissertation I present projects along these three areas of effort that accomplish the two goals (increase bandwidth and reduce delay) to achieve the purpose of improving the Internet's ability to deliver essential and life improving services. These projects and their organization into areas of effort, goals and purpose are my contributions to the networking sciences. The Internet has become a vital and essential part of modern everyday life. Services delivered by the Internet are used by people across the planet every moment of every day of the year. The Internet has proven a positive force for good improving the lives of billions of people worldwide. The power of the Internet to deliver this positive good to humanity relies on its ability to deliver life improving services. In my doctorate work culminating in this dissertation I have striven to sustain and increase the Internet's ability to deliver these services and to have a positive good effect upon humanity.",,,
94,"Miocene ungulates from Laguna del Laja, Chile, and an assessment of the Laguna del Laja faunas","The five new taxa described in this study are included in rigorous phylogenetic analyses of Interatheriinae and Hegetotheriidae (Typotheria, Notoungulata), providing new hypotheses of morphological evolution within these clades, and documenting independent yet apparently simultaneous radiations of interatheres and hegetotheres with ever-growing (hypselodont) dentitions. A significant majority of fossils from LdL are small-bodied taxa (e.g., rodents and typotherian notoungualtes) represented by dental and cranial elements. This size distribution is unusual compared to other well-known early Miocene faunas, and may reflect differential transport of skeletal elements in lahar-associated depositional settings. The high level of endemism across multiple SALMAs at LdL is also striking, particularly considering the geographic proximity of faunas from LdL with roughly coeval counterparts in neighboring regions of Argentina. The unique history of mammals in South America has long provided significant evolutionary and geological insights, but the continent's fossil record is strongly biased toward the lowlands of Argentine Patagonia. Recent collecting efforts in the Andean Main Range of Chile, near Laguna del Laja (LdL) (_37.5_ S, 71_ W), have yielded a stratigraphically superposed series of early to late Miocene fossil mammal assemblages, shedding light on the poorly known extra-Patagonian history of South American Neogene mammals. Several hundred specimens have been recovered from the Cura-Mallin and overlying Trapa-Trapa formations at LdL. Nearly all of these fossils were collected from a well-described stratigraphic sequence that includes 17 high precision 40Ar/39Ar ages. This robust temporal framework encompasses fossiliferous horizons spanning _20-9 Ma. This provinciality of the Andean faunas, relative to Argentine assemblages, likely reflects sampling of a regionally distinct and isolated paleoenvironment. Herein I provide a detailed account of the ungulates from the Cura-Mallin Formation at LdL; these range in age from _20-15 Ma (early to middle Miocene). Dentitions referred to Protypotherium praerutilum, a well-known but inadequately diagnosed species, motivated a long overdue (but preliminary) taxonomic revision. Occurrences of Protypotherium, Colpodon, and Astrapothericulus, together with radioisotopic ages, indicate that faunas spanning the Colhuehuapian and Santacrucian South American Land Mammal ""Ages"" (SALMAs) occur in direct stratigraphic superposition at LdL. These deposits have also yielded five new genera of typotherians (Notoungulata); this high level of endemism has also been noted among rodent faunas from LdL.",,,
95,Localizing the Islands: Theaters of Place and Culture in Hawai'i's Drama,"Albert Wendt asserts that when Indigenous Pacific Islanders regionalize the Pacific through literature and art, they reclaim and reassert control over their individual communities and introduce a decolonizing thought process that transfers to native readers and spectators. In the 1970s a cultural renaissance of artistic and performative traditions spread throughout the Pacific Region, speaking to the specific and individual decolonization experiences of each island grouping. Hawai'i, in particular, has nurtured a lively and active theater scene since the 1940s, focusing largely on representing Native Hawaiian and Local identity in Hawai'i since the conception of Kumu Kahua Theatre (KKT) in the 1970s. In the late 1980s playwrights like Victoria Nalani Kneubuhl and Alani Apio emerged, ushering in an era of Native Hawaiian representation that mirrors contemporary Native Hawaiian concerns. These concerns have yet to be fully explored in contemporary theater scholarship leaving a large body of plays written and produced throughout the Hawaiian Islands open to interpretation and examination. Using a decolonization methodology and a material semiotic approach to dramatic criticism, my dissertation examines the cross-cultural depictions found in the plays produced in Hawai'i to better understand how Native Hawaiian indigenous identity is depicted and juxtaposed within an Americanized landscape. My dissertation relies on the works of Dennis Carroll, Justina Mattos, Sammie Choy, and Diana Looser in my discussion about Hawai'i's theater. I rely heavily on theories and scholarship written by Pacific and Hawaiian theorists in order to contextualize Hawai'i's relationship with the Pacific and balance its colonial relationship with the U.S.A. Works by Albert Wendt, Linda Tuhiwai Smith, J. Kehaulani Kauanui, Noenoe Smith, Michelle Keown, and Alice Te Punga Somerville, to name a few, help me to identify the Pacific and, even more specifically, the Hawaiian concerns addressed and criticized within the plays' plots and characterizations. Finally, intercultural theater theories by Rustom Bharucha, Daryl Chin, Craig Latrell, and Christopher Balme aid in my investigation of the cross-cultural exchanges made within the script and during the performance. Using a selection of plays written by haole (Caucasian) and Native Hawaiian playwrights in Hawai'i, I argue that when Native Hawaiian characters are depicted using responsible historiography and foundational indigenous epistemologies, the colonizer vs. colonized binary is broken down and the in-between space that best represents how Native Hawaiians are dealing with Americanization today is revealed. As works of drama, these plays illustrate the multi-dimensional aspects of colonial influence on Native Hawaiian thought and customs to audiences made up of Hawai'i's diverse population. They demonstrate how intercultural theatrical aesthetics, western dramatic strategies, and indigenous epistemologies create a unique forms of syncretic theater in Hawai'i. The breadth of topics and perspectives found in these plays suggest that challenging colonization and the constant negotiations native identity has made in the midst of American politics and globalization are important features of Hawai'i's homegrown theater practices.",,,
96,Moments and Patterns that Matter : Identifying Literate Opportunities and Developmental Trajectories in a Middle School Classroom,"This analysis shows that students engage in enduring, situated orchestration shifts (ESOS) in their use of talk, tools, and texts around and for the act of writing, and that these shifts serve as the groundwork upon which writing development builds. Implications for teacher education, the teaching of writing, and the act of writing are proposed based on these findings. When examining writing for multiple purposes in the classroom---such as benchmarks, warm-ups, etc.---specific literate acts were, when analyzed in a multi-exposure manner, shown to have pathways of connections leading outward from them both forward and backward in time. These acts were then analyzed and connected through intertextual connections, genre sets and systems, activity systems, and community values to other kinds of writing that students complete throughout the school year. Through a theoretical framework that examines writing activity as the individuated, intersubjective (Bazerman, 2013) establishment of structurated (Giddens, 1984) situations (Mehan & Wood, 1975a) that reinforce and perpetuate systems of activity (Engestrom, 2001) in a flat, uneven social world (Latour, 2003), this work examines literacy development as a series of literate acts of increasing complexity and specificity suspended in time and space and connected materially in a variety of ways. These literate acts serve as resources for future writing activity that can be accessed via these material connections as well as the networks of connections established in the minds of users of literacy. Literate activity, like all human activity, is situated in localities: points of time and space wherein individuals engage in literate acts in order to accomplish goals. But these points of time and space are situated in a history of individuals, collectives, tools, and environment, and each element in that point of time and space bring with it layered histories, meanings, and intentions. What is not yet clear from research on literacy, writing development, and classroom activity is how these points of time and space are utilized as resources for writers in new situations, and how the structure of schooling and its changes over time shape those resources. This project explores how the activity of student writing grows and changes at different points of space and time throughout the school year for ten seventh-grade students in two language arts classes in southern California, and, furthermore, how those points of space and time lead to changes in the patterns of writing activity that those students engage in. By focusing on ten students in those two classrooms and tracking their writing habits throughout the course of the school year, this study shows the changes in writing that happened to these students over time. These observations of the students, which was supported by video analysis, document collection, and interviews with both students and their teacher, are analyzed through a grounded theory analysis (Saldana, 2009) through eleven different exposures (Prior, 1998) in order to bound student action within literate acts.",,,
97,Robotic Surveillance and Deployment Strategies,"Second, we consider the problem of optimal coverage with a group of mobile agents. For a planar environment with an associated density function, this problem is equivalent to dividing the environment into optimal subregions such that each agent is responsible for the coverage of its own region. We study this problem for the discrete time and space case and the continuous time and space case. For the discrete time and space case, we present algorithms that provide optimal coverage control in a non-convex environment when each robot has only asynchronous and sporadic communication with a base station. We introduce the notion of coverings, a generalization of partitions, to do this. For the continuous time and space case, we present a continuous-time distributed policy which allows a team of agents to achieve a convex area-constrained partition in a convex workspace. This work is related to the classic Lloyd algorithm, and makes use of generalized Voronoi diagrams. For both cases we provide detailed simulation results and discuss practical implementation issues. Autonomous mobile systems are becoming more common place, and have the opportunity to revolutionize many modern application areas. They include, but are not limited to, tasks such as search and rescue operations, ad-hoc mobile wireless networks and warehouse management; each application having its own complexities and challenging problems that need addressing. In this thesis, we explore and characterize two application areas in particular. First, we explore the problem of autonomous stochastic surveillance. In particular, we study random walks on a finite graph that are described by a Markov chain. We present strategies that minimize the first hitting time of the Markov chain, and look at both the single agent and multi-agent cases. In the single agent case, we provide a formulation and convex optimization scheme for the hitting time on graphs with travel distances. In addition, we provide detailed simulation results showing the effectiveness of our strategy versus other well-known Markov chain design strategies. In the multi-agent case, we provide the first characterization of the hitting time for multiple random walkers, which we denote the ""group hitting time"". We also provide a closed form solution for calculating the hitting time between specified nodes for both the single and multiple random walker cases. Our results allow for the multiple random walks to be different and, moreover, for the random walks to operate on different subgraphs. Finally, we use sequential quadratic programming to find the transition matrices that generate minimal ""group hitting time"".",,,
98,CuH-Catalyzed Reactions on Allylic Systems,"Reductions of unsaturated systems with copper hydride have been well studied. However, the reactivity of copper hydride with allenes is an area that has yet to be fully explored. By placing an allene moiety next to an electron withdrawing aromatic or carbonyl species, it was discovered that a copper hydride catalyst is able to chemoselectively reduce the allene to an allyl species. When studying the reactivity of an enantioenriched propargyl carbonate with a chiral copper hydride catalyst, it was found that the starting material synthesized with S-BINOL saw >90% conversion with S-DTBM-Segphos CuH and only _50% conversion with R-DTBM-Segphos CuH, indicating a possible match-mismatch situation, which is in support of previously established mechanisms that indicate a backside S N2' delivery to propargyl systems. This methodology provides synthetic chemists a new retrosynthetic disconnection, as the propargyl carbonates can be readily synthesized from aldehydes and alkynyl nucleophiles. This novel transformation allows streamlined access to allylic aromatic compounds, which constitute a number of essential oil natural products, including elemicin, dillapiole, apiol, and myristicin. The advent of copper hydride dates back over 150 years to 1844 when Wurtz reported its preparation via the reduction of copper oxide with hydrophosphoric acid, making copper hydride the oldest properly characterized metal hydride. Chemists must often compromise a direct approach to building complex molecules due to the limited number of methods available to manipulate molecular functionality. While this methodology may be of greatest immediate use to organic chemists, the technology is potentially of use to chemists from a wide variety of disciplines. Materials chemists can take advantage of alkene functionality in polymerization reactions. Inorganic and physical chemists can study the mechanism of the organometallic catalyzed reaction. Chemical biologists and biochemists can more easily diversify chiral compound libraries in a drug discovery setting. Green and process chemists can continue to reduce the costs and environmental hazards of the technology while simultaneously moving to recyclable large-scale batches. Although this chemistry methodology and synthetic analyses are quite technical, the implications of the research are of interest to popular non-scientific audiences. Molecular oxidants have been shown to damage cellular contents and promote ageing, thus antioxidants for the treatment of aging, such as CoQ10, or novel vitamin E analogues, are of importance to anyone interested in anti-aging medicines. As healthcare continues towards personalized, genetic based medicine, patients with GPX4 abnormalities that are unable to metabolize harmful molecular oxidants may find that a vitamin E analogue is the best molecule to mediate the effects of rapid aging caused by altered GPX4 expression.",,,
99,Design and Development of Donor-Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts : A New Visible Light Activated Photochromic Compound,"The development of an easily synthesized, modular, and tunable organic photoswitch that responds to visible light has been a long-standing pursuit. Herein we provide a detailed account of the design and synthesis of a new class of photochromes based on furfural, termed donor--acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs). A wide variety of these derivatives are easily prepared from commercially available starting materials, and their photophysical properties are shown to be dependent on the substituents of the push--pull system. Analysis of the switching behavior provides conditions to access the two structural isomers of the DASAs, reversibly switch between them, and use their unique solubility behavior to provide dynamic phase-transfer materials. Overall, these negative photochromes respond to visible light and heat and display an unprecedented level of structural modularity and tunabilty. We demonstrate the considerable potential of DASA photoswitches in two unique and powerful applications. First we have applied DASAs for the visible light-initiated recycling of homo-geneous organic catalysts. This catalyst-photoswitch construct effectively polymerized lac-tide with control over molecular weight and a low PDI. The visible-light mediated phase transfer and subsequent recovery of the thiourea catalyst allowed recycling of the organocat-alyst. Further, the potential of these photoswitches in biological applications is demonstrated through the synthesis of a functional amphiphile that displays on-demand light-mediated disassembly and cargo release. This one-photon visible light-responsive micellar system served as an efficient, on-demand drug delivery system. The efficiency and effectiveness of this system was demonstrated in an in-vitro setting, delivering the chemotherapeutic paclitaxel only on exposure to visible light.",,,
100,"Transient Photocurrent Measurements of Charge Generation, Transport, and Recombination Dynamics in Bulk Heterojunction Solar Cells","Organic solar cells are a premier candidate for cost-effective, industrial-scale, renewable energy production. However, while it is necessary for the power conversion efficiencies of such devices to improve in order for this vision to be fully realized, many of the crucial physical processes occurring within them are not yet completely understood. Focusing on the newest generations of materials, we investigated the charge generation, transport, and recombination dynamics in optimized, thin film bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells through time-resolved transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements. This technique is capable of yielding detailed insights into the carrier mobility, different recombination mechanisms, the carrier density, and the density of states in ways that are largely inaccessable via most steady state approaches. The design and construction of a high-speed, high-resolution transient photocurrent system is presented. Subsequent TPC measurements on optimized polymer and small molecule solar cells revealed that the charge carrier generation profile in efficient devices is largely independent of the internal electric field, which allowed for accurate quantification of the competition between charge carrier sweep-out and recombination in such cells. In addition, geminate recombination via charge transfer excitons was found to be generally absent as a photocurrent loss mechanism, which implies that the charge transfer state intermediary in the carrier generation process does not have a binding energy significantly greater than thermal energy. Charge carrier transport through BHJ solar cells is fundamentally dispersive due to the disordered structure and complex film morphology within the photoactive layer. The resulting distribution of carrier mobilities is dependent on the density of states, and has a profound impact on device performance. Unfortunately, currently available measurement techniques yield only a single number for cross-cell carrier mobility, which is insufficient when viewed in the context of understanding transport through dispersive materials. Here we present a novel application of transient photocurrent and short circuit variable time-delayed collection field measurements. This unique combination allowed us to reconstruct the complete mobility distribution for the photogenerated carriers in optimized BHJ solar cells, enabling a much richer visualization of the transport dynamics than was previously possible. We demonstrate the versatility of these techniques on optimized devices comprising polymer and small molecule donors, as well as conventional and inverted architectures.",,,
101,High Resolution Laser Spectroscopy and Nanoscale Proximal Probe Desorption of Historically Significant Molecules,"The advantages of R2PI spectroscopy have been extended to include nanoscale proximal probe thermal desorption, allowing detection of organic paint pigments in situ within microscopic paint cross sections. These organic paints are often present as part of complex mixtures within thin layers, well below the spatial resolution of many instruments. We also report the first high resolution spectroscopy of chromophores within madder dye, an historically significant organic colorant, allowing for the unambiguous identification of the molecule within the intrinsically complex nature of ancient paintings. Additionally, pottery sherds from Maya vessels (600-900 CE) and Mississippian vessels (1100-1200 CE) were examined for three molecular markers (theobromine, theophylline and caffeine) using R2PI spectroscopic techniques. The data obtained supports the existence of a previously unknown trade network between Mesoamerican and North American civilizations. A system combining laser desorption, jet-cooling, resonant 2-photon ionization (R2PI) spectroscopy, and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) generates exceptionally well resolved vibronic spectroscopy and fragment free mass spectrometry for molecules within a complex matrix. Following laser desorption, gas-phase molecules are entrained in a supersonic molecular beam of argon. This causes extremely efficient jet-cooling of the internal degrees of freedom within the molecules and makes it possible to perform high resolution spectroscopy. The cold molecule is resonantly excited to the first electronic excited state by a tunable dye laser, and subsequently ionized by another photon before being detected in the TOF-MS. The result is the ability to selectively ionize a single target molecule within an extremely complex matrix.",,,
102,"No Effort, No Entry : Vestimentary Systems in ""Africa's Gay Capital""","Since its transition from apartheid in 1993, South Africa has presented itself as one of the most liberal and progressive democracies in the world. Even in 2014, as it celebrates 20 years of democracy, South Africa garners the attention of scholars, NGO activists, and political refugees---all of whom are captivated by the expanse of minority and human rights enshrined in its constitution. With such attention, Cape Town earns the proud moniker "" The Gay Capital of Africa""---whose vibrant nightlife makes it an (inter, trans)national epitome of ""LGBT"" equality. Such impulses are implicated in struggles over race and space that reveal persistent class divisions among black and coloured-identified gay men. I, therefore, commit my research to participants' significant and agentic strategies to achieve visibility and participate in ""The Gay Capital of Africa""---through which they upset the terms of effort and construct more capacious ways of being a gay man. Drawing from Michel Foucault, Jasbir Puar, Jose Munoz, and Roland Barthes' notion of ""Vestimentary Systems,"" I conclude that clothing is a performance of post-apartheid modernity and strategy for surviving persistent structural constraints in Cape Town. I ask: what are the terms of such equality? How do gay men seek, acquire, and maintain visibility in Capetonian nightlife? What does such visibility mean, and what does the South African state gain from its documentation in LGBT tourism media? Through participant observation and interviews, I explore what admission standards at nightlife venues in De Waterkant---Cape Town's ""Gay Village---say about being a (post-apartheid) gay man. Juxtaposing gay nightlife with a post-apartheid democracy, I show how nightclubs are regulatory institutions that produce subjects whose clothed bodies signify gay and racial equality. I read the performative dimensions of clothing as homonationalist projects that harness gay Capetonians' impulses for equality as ""gay (human) capital"" to evidence successful purveyance of democracy and unfettered access to the market.",,,
103,Heterogeneous Integration for Reduced Phase Noise and Improved Reliability of Semiconductor Lasers,"Second, we present the results of a reliability study conducted to investigate the influence of molecular wafer bonding between Si and InP on the lifetime of distributed feedback lasers, a common laser source used in optical communication. No degradation in lasing threshold or slope efficiency was observed after aging the lasers for 5000hrs at 70C and 2500hrs at 85C. However, among the three chosen bonding interface layer options, the devices with an interface superlattice layer showed a higher yield for lasers and lower dark current values in the on-chip monitor photodiodes after aging. Significant savings in cost, power and space are possible in existing optical data transmission networks, sensors and metrology equipment through photonic integration. Photonic integration can be broadly classified into two categories, hybrid and monolithic integration. The former involves assembling multiple single functionality optical devices together into a single package including any optical coupling and/or electronic connections. On the other hand monolithic integration assembles many devices or optical functionalities on a single chip so that all the optical connections are on chip and require no external alignment. This provides a substantial improvement in reliability and simplifies testing. Monolithic integration has been demonstrated on both indium phosphide (InP) and silicon (Si) substrates. Integration on larger 300mm Si substrates can further bring down the cost and has been a major area of research in recent years. Furthermore, with increasing interest from industry, the hybrid silicon platform is emerging as a new technology for integrating various active and passive optical elements on a single chip. This is both in the interest of bringing down manufacturing cost through scaling along with continued improvement in performance and to produce multi-functional photonic integrated circuits (PIC). The goal of this work is twofold. First, we show four laser demonstrations that use the hybrid silicon platform to lower phase noise due to spontaneous emission, based on the following two techniques, viz. confinement factor reduction and negative optical feedback. The first two demonstrations are of mode-locked lasers and the next two are of tunable lasers. Some of the key results include; (a) 14dB white frequency noise reduction of a 20GHz radio-frequency (RF) signal from a harmonically mode-locked long cavity laser with greater than 55dB supermode noise suppression, (b) 8dB white frequency noise reduction from a colliding pulse mode-locked laser by reducing the number of quantum wells and a further 6dB noise reduction using coherent photon seeding from long on-chip coupled cavity, (c) linewidth reduction of a tunable laser down to 160kHz using negative optical feedback from coupled ring resonator mirrors, and (d) linewidth reduction of a widely tunable laser down to 50kHz using on-chip coupled cavity feedback effect.",,,
104,The Other Side of Racism : Welfare Recipients and Racial Privilege in Greater Boston,"White women on welfare have largely been absent from both the public discourse on welfare and sociological research on racism, poverty, inequality and mobility. This dissertation contributes to these areas of inquiry by providing an empirical study of the operation and reproduction of racial privilege among impoverished women living in the hypersegregated communities of Greater Boston, Massachusetts. In particular, my research examines the role white welfare recipient's play in the construction and reproduction of racism, white privilege and white racial identities. This study is guided by the following questions: 1) How do white women on welfare conceptualize racial identity within the US context of a historically racialized welfare state? How do they manage this racialized institution? 2) How do women on welfare cope with social stigma in their public and private lives? How does race impact how women on welfare negotiate social stigma? What types of boundary work do women on welfare create, maintain and reproduce? 3) Do white women use whiteness as a resource? How do they deploy whiteness as a resource? In what particular contexts can white women on welfare use whiteness as a resource? Drawing from eight-five in-depth qualitative interviews with women who receive Transitional Assistance for Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC) and ethnographic observations of Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) offices in Greater Boston I argue that welfare legislation and policy reflects the dominant gendered, racist and classist discourses of our society and structures the identity and lived experience of welfare recipients in profoundly racialized ways. In particular, racial privilege shapes white women on welfare's access to a range of public and private benefits and resources. My research finds that white women on welfare conceptualize their whiteness within larger discourses of hegemonic whiteness and within the context of a racialized welfare system. I empirically demonstrate that whiteness can be deployed as a form of embodied capital that offers welfare recipients with section eight housing vouchers access to greater housing opportunities, and as a result numerous social, economic and symbolic resources for their families. Furthermore, white women on welfare are able to utilize social stigma management strategies, such as passing, that often facilitate the social and economic mobility of their families.",,,
105,High temperature deformation mechanisms of L12-containing Co-based superalloys,"Ni-based superalloys have been used as the structural material of choice for high temperature applications in gas turbine engines since the 1940s, but their operating temperature is becoming limited by their melting temperature (Tm =1300degrees C). Despite decades of research, no viable alternatives to Ni-based superalloys have been discovered and developed. However, in 2006, a ternary gamma' phase was discovered in the Co-Al-W system that enabled a new class of Co-based superalloys to be developed. These new Co-based superalloys possess a gamma-gamma' microstructure that is nearly identical to Ni-based superalloys, which enables these superalloys to achieve extraordinary high temperature mechanical properties. Furthermore, Co-based alloys possess the added benefit of exhibiting a melting temperature of at least 100degrees C higher than commercial Ni-based superalloys. Superalloys used as the structural materials in high pressure turbine blades must withstand large thermomechanical stresses imparted from the rotating disk and hot, corrosive gases present. These stresses induce time-dependent plastic deformation, which is commonly known as creep, and new superalloys must possess adequate creep resistance over a broad range of temperature in order to be used as the structural materials for high pressure turbine blades. For these reasons, this research focuses on quantifying high temperature creep properties of new gamma'-containing Co-based superalloys and identifying the high temperature creep deformation mechanisms. High resolution electron microscopy studies revealed chemical fluctuations of solute near stacking faults and antiphase boundaries in the gamma' phases. These chemical fluctuations were found to significantly reduce the stacking fault energy, which was calculated via first-principles. The implications for these chemical fluctuations on creep strength were determined, and new models for precipitate shearing will be presented. Furthermore, the implications for the design of new Co- and CoNi-based compositions will be discussed. The high temperature creep properties of new Co- and CoNi-based alloys were found to be comparable to Ni-based superalloys with respect to minimum creep rates and creep-rupture lives at 900degrees C up to the solvus temperature of the gamma' phase. Co-based alloys exhibited a propensity for extended superlattice stacking fault formation in the gamma' precipitates resulting from dislocation shearing events. When Ni was added to the Co-based compositions, this mode of shearing altered such that extended antiphase boundaries formed in the gamma' precipitates. These high temperature shearing mechanisms differ from Ni-based superalloys, where shearing occurs via APB-coupled dislocations.",,,
106,Analysis of Electromigration in Nanofluidics,"Finally, we use our model to estimate particle zeta potential by measured mobility from several experiments. The results show that our model is required to capture double layer polarization and double layer interaction. In addition, the composition of electrolyte solution is important in determining the particle mobility as well as the zeta potential. Numerical simulation is used to calculate the electrophoretic mobility of a charged spherical nanoparticle confined in a nanochannel, under a weakly applied electric field. Classic models for electrophoretic mobility are valid only in the linear regime of small particle zeta potential, and for an unbounded fluid domain. However, these models fail to predict the electrophoretic mobility measured experimentally in bounded nanochannels. We adopt asymptotically-expanded formulations and solve the fully-coupled equations on a 3D finite element domain. Factors affecting particle mobility include electrolyte concentration, channel size, and zeta potentials on both the particle surface and channel walls. Specifically, spherical particles are examined with diameters 2 a = 10 and 50 nm, in a 100 nm high channel. The non-dimensional electric double layers were varied between 0.1 < ka < 100. The results indicate that the mobility of a particle located at the nanochannel centerline agrees to within 1% of the average mobility of a particle distributed transversely throughout the nanochannel. Furthermore, confinement by the nanochannel walls was found to affect greatly nanoparticle mobility. As a result, it is feasible to use nanochannels to separate two different size nanoparticles, even when the particles have equal zeta potentials. Finally, a new method is proposed to estimate accurately particle and wall zeta potentials by contrasting the observed differences in mobility in two different height channels. Next, two-dimensional nanorods are simulated numerically to study the electromigration within nanoscale fluidic channels. We improved on an existing steady-state model to include fluid-structure interaction and capture dynamics of moving nanorods. Specifically, we investigate the motion of a 2 nm x 3.4 nm two-dimensional rod-like particle (representative of 10 bp DNA) in a 100 nm two-dimensional channel under an applied external electric field. The results show that due to the interaction between the electric double layers (EDLs) of the particle and the channel walls, the particle is confined to the centerline of a channel with thick EDLs. In contrast, an oscillatory motion is observed for thin EDLs, which can be explained by examining the electrophoretic and hydrodynamic forces and moments on the particle. Although thermal fluctuations are not modeled, and could negate the effects of the oscillatory motion in practical systems, the effect is still of value to understand. We calculate the electrophoretic mobility of these confined nanorods and compare the results with the approximated mobility from our steady-state model. Although the thick EDL systems match well, the results show an up to 10% difference in mobility of the two models for the 50 mM electrolyte concentration, which indicates that the fluid-structure interaction is important for mobility of non-spherical particles, in thin double-layer systems.",,,
107,Student Satisfaction with Online Learning,"Further, a relationship between students' perception of TA availability and their overall satisfaction with the online course was among the relationships found. In addition, opportunities for human interaction emerged as a significant predictor of satisfaction in a regression. For the qualitative portion of this study, open-ended questions and interview results revealed that students' perceived opportunities for human interaction and participation with TAs enhanced their experiences with online courses. Implications for research and practice were identified. For example, design of online courses should consider the use of TAs to enhance student satisfaction. This study sought to provide an analysis of online education in higher education with a focus on how the condition of human interaction will affect students' satisfaction relating to their online class experiences. The central question the study sought to answer is: What aspects of human interaction (instructor, teaching assistant [TA], student peer) have led to students' satisfaction with online courses in the UC online setting? This study used mixed methods of quantitative survey items, qualitative survey items, and qualitative interviewing to explore student perceptions of human interaction. Students in 21 undergraduate, online courses (n = 253) at three UC campuses completed an online survey. Then eight students were interviewed, as their open-ended responses could provide more insight into their experiences with online learning. Descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analysis were reported for the quantitative portion of the study. Regarding means, analyses revealed that students reported moderate opportunities available to them for human interaction in their online classes. For perceived opportunities for human interaction with TAs, the mean score was 3.45 (between 3 ""a few opportunities"" and 4 ""not much opportunity"") on a Likert Scale. In addition, perceptions of participation with human interaction by students appeared lower, on average, than perceived opportunities.",,,
108,"On The Present, Utopia, and the Caribbean Intervention in Critical Theory","This dissertation constructs a genealogy of queer cultural production in the Spanish Caribbean during the last 60 years. It privileges queer texts because the convergence of queerness and Caribbeanness produces a generative space for understanding the role of critical utopian ways of knowing, such as salsa epistemology. Indeed it argues that salsa epistemology helps us rethink the social justice lens of both Latina/o Studies and Queer Theory by refusing to engage in the dichotomous assumption that we must attain some level of socio-political justice in order to entertain the possibility of utopia. It pushes scholars to rethink playfully how temporality has been understood in critical theory by acknowledging the back and forth that always exists between the present moment and utopia. By suggesting that embodied joy in the present is a powerful force in creating a more equitable future, this dissertation rethinks the future-oriented framework of most social justice movements to argue that justice can be reconceived as something joyful, and that the joyful can reconceived as something just. This dissertation engages with salsa, a Spanish Caribbean music and dance tradition of embodied playfulness, to show how joy figures as an integral part of social justice work. It argues that the Cuba, Puerto Rico, and their diasporic communities have generated a particular mode of consciousness that---while often fetishized and dismissed as carefree and erotic island living---actually dismantles hegemonic forms of gender, sexualization, and racialization. I term this consciousness ""salsa epistemology,"" and define it as an embodied and playful way of knowing produced through Spanish Caribbean cultural practices. Salsa epistemology allows Spanish Caribbean people to navigate hardship by existing simultaneously in the everyday material circumstances of their lives and in the utopian spaces crafted in their media, literature, and philosophy. Both literally and metaphorically, it is the ability to think while one dances, or to dance while one thinks. This dissertation unfolds in five chapters, each of which elaborates a tactic of salsa epistemology at work in Spanish Caribbean written, visual, or aural culture. Chapter one, ""Playing Hopefully: The Present and the Utopic in Queer Theory and Puerto Rican Literature,"" posits ""play"" as a tactic of salsa epistemology. Chapter two, ""Zones of Possibility and Other Forms of Lezamian Consciousness,"" examines ""possibility"" as a temporal framework and a tactic of salsa epistemology. Chapter three, ""Penetrating Utopia: Sex as Politics in Queer Cuban Exile Literature,"" posits ""sex"" as a tactic of salsa epistemology. Chapter four, ""Choteo as a Tactic of Resilience in Que Pasa U.S.A.?"" posits ""choteo,"" a Cuban form of humor loosely translated as ""kidding,"" as a tactic of salsa epistemology. The final chapter, ""Capitalism con salsa: Money and Popular Culture in the Cuban Diaspora"" suggests a non-teleological engagement with capitalism as a tactic of salsa epistemology. Finally, the conclusion, ""An Epistemology of Resilience,"" meditates on my own personal journey to salsa epistemology and on the larger implications of the work as a whole for the survival of the United States' largest growing ethnic group: Latina/os.",,,
109,Growth and Electronic Structure of Heusler Compounds for Use in Electron Spin Based Devices,"Co2MnSi and Co2FeSi were also grown by MBE on GaAs (001) for use as spin injectors into GaAs lateral spin valve devices. By the growth of the quaternary alloy Co2FexMn1-- xSi and varying x, electron doping of the full Heusler compound was demonstrated by observation of a crossover from a majority spin polarization of Co2MnSi to a minority spin polarization in Co2FeSi. Co2MnSi films were studied as a function of the nucleation sequence, using either Co-- or MnSi-- initiated films on c(4x4) GaAs. Studies using x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), STM/STS, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) suggest that the bulk of the Co2MnSi films and the interfacial structure between Co 2MnSi and GaAs is not modified by the nucleation sequence, but a change in spin transport characteristics suggests a modification of semiconductor band structure at the Co2MnSi/GaAs interface due to diffusion of Mn leading to compensation of the Schottky barrier contact. Diffusion of Mn into the GaAs was confirmed by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements. The proposed mechanism for the modified spin transport characteristics for MnSi initiated films is that additional diffusion of Mn into the GaAs, widens the Schottky barrier contact region. These studies suggest that the ideal initiation sequence for Co2MnSi/GaAs (001) lateral spin valve devices is achieved by deposition of Co first. Spintronic devices, where information is carried by the quantum spin state of the electron instead of purely its charge, have gained considerable interest for their use in future computing technologies. For optimal performance, a pure spin current, where all electrons have aligned spins, must be generated and transmitted across many interfaces and through many types of materials. While conventional spin sources have historically been elemental ferromagnets, like Fe or Co, these materials pro duce only partially spin polarized currents. To increase the spin polarization of the current, materials like half-metallic ferromagnets, where there is a gap in the minority spin density of states around the Fermi level, or topological insulators, where the current transport is dominated by spin-locked surface states, show promise. A class of materials called Heusler compounds, with electronic structures that range from normal metals, to half metallic ferromagnets, semiconductors, superconductors and even topological insulators, interfaces well with existing device technologies, and through the use of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) high quality heterostructures and films can be grown. This dissertation examines the electronic structure of surfaces and interfaces of both topological insulator (PtLuSb-- and PtLuBi--) and half-metallic ferromagnet (Co2MnSi-- and Co2FeSi--) III-V semiconductor heterostructures. PtLuSb and PtLuBi growth by MBE was demonstrated on Alx In1--xSb (001) ternaries. PtLuSb (001) surfaces were observed to reconstruct with either (1x3) or c(2x2) unit cells depending on Sb overpressure and substrate temperature. viii The electronic structure of these films was studied by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and photoemission spectroscopy. STS measurements as well as angle resolved photoemission spectropscopy (ARPES) suggest that PtLuSb has a zero-gap or semimetallic band structure. Additionally, the observation of linearly dispersing surface states, with an approximate crossing point 240meV above the Fermi level, suggests that PtLuSb (001) films are topologically non-trivial. PtLuBi films also display a Fermi level position approximately 500meV below the valence band maximum.",,,
110,The effect of diet treatment on mating preference in Drosophila melanogaster,"Assortative mating has been a focus of theoretical and experimental research because of its potential to promote sexual isolation and create biodiversity at many scales, yet mechanisms to explain its potential have been limited. Sharon et al. (2010) discovered that Drosophila melanogaster can mate assortatively based on diet leading to initial reproductive isolation without genetic evolution. In response to their findings I attempted to reproduce their results with the following objectives: 1) replicate the results of Sharon et al. (2010), 2) Determine if the previous results were limited to the genotype the authors used, 3) Determine the generality of their results using additional experimental designs, and 4) Assess which sex drove assortative mating. My results were supportive of the previous findings using a different inbred strain than previously used, but results were negative in an outbred strain. Results were supported by alternative mate choice designs, but I could not determine which sex drove assortative mating preference.",,,
111,#AmINext? A discussion on the sexual violence and trafficking of Aboriginal women in Canada and the link to domestic extractive industries,"To frame my discussion, I use a critical global studies perspective as well as the work of Native American scholar Andrea Smith, who argues that sexual violence is a tool of patriarchy, colonialism, and racism by which certain people (i.e. Aboriginal women) become marked as ""inherently rapable"". As such, issues of colonial, race, and gender oppression intersect and cannot be studied separately. Human trafficking is a global issue, one to which Canada is not immune. I argue that there is a poorly recognized relationship between the vulnerability to violence and trafficking of Aboriginal women in Canada and the domestic extractive industries of Canada, alleging that extractive industries are a source of sexual violence against Aboriginal women and a risk factor for sexual violence and human trafficking. I believe that further research and in-depth analysis needs to be conducted concerning the oppression of Aboriginal women and the reasons why they are at heightened risk to sexual violence and trafficking. By investigating the underlying factors and manner by which these three typically separate elements -- Aboriginal women in Canada, sexual violence and human trafficking, and extractive industries - intersect and perpetuate one another, I draw attention to an under-acknowledged issue facing a deeply marginalized population. I employ a qualitative approach, drawing on current literature discussing colonization, sexual violence, human trafficking, Aboriginal populations in Canada, and extractive industries. My discussion, based on an analysis of the information collected through archival research, is divided into three large sections: (a) an in-depth discussion concerning the overlap between colonialism, violence, and extraction, and how gendered oppression and sexual violence have migrated from colonialism to present day extractive industries; (b) an exploration of how the ""ideal victim"" archetype, when coupled with racism, stereotypes, and social constructions of vulnerability, undermines the experiences of Aboriginal women who are consequently re-victimized by the legal institutions and society, made invisible, and deemed unworthy of any recourse (c) an investigation into the role of culture, firstly by considering how the destruction of Aboriginal culture was an assault on their identity, self-esteem, self-perception, values, and overall well-being and secondly, by exploring how the patriarchal, hypermasculine culture, found both within the broader Canadian society but also within extractive industries, plays a role in facilitating violence and indifference towards Aboriginal women. I conclude by recommending mitigation strategies to address the risks faced by Aboriginal women and their communities. A multi-system approach targeting sexual violence, racism, and poverty (among others) is necessary for success - hence my suggestions range from actions on the part of Aboriginal communities to actions at the legal, national, and international levels.",,,
112,Redshift : From Communist Internationalism to Blood. The Legacy of Soviet Nationalities Policy in the Caucasus,"While the twentieth century saw the rise of nationalism in many parts of the world, the experience of ethno-national groups within the Soviet Union deserves particular attention. Faced with the reality of governing the vast, multi-ethnic territories of the former Russian Empire, the Bolsheviks devised and implemented a set of strategies intended to confront the rising specter of nationalism. State policies initiated in the 1920s aimed to construct and reinforce ethno-national identity among the diverse groups that inhabited northern Eurasia from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean. This work examines these policies and shows how they came to play a significant role in group identity formation in the second half of the twentieth century and the violence that erupted in the Caucasus at the collapse of the Soviet Union. In addition to a detailed longue duree qualitative exploration of the process by which Soviet policies fostered deeply ingrained national identities that became powerful organizing tools in the post-Soviet era, this work also pursues a quantitative examination of demographic data compiled by the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and the post-Soviet states to show that ethno-national homogenization of territory in favor of the titular nationalities was a process that began long before the violence and acts of ethnic cleansing that occurred with the fall of the USSR and that these demographic changes correlate with the different periods of implementation of nationalities specific policies.",,,
113,A Functional Grammar of Khatso,"The most fundamental feature of Khatso is the fact that it is a pragmatics-based language, meaning that verbal semantics and discourse context are often more crucial than syntax in comprehending the language. Topic-comment structures and zero anaphora are frequent, regularly creating utterances in which key information is underspecified or absent. Some constructions, such as pragmatic agent marking, are triggered only when the context is ambiguous. And, many particles and constructions in Khatso are multifunctional, relying on context to clarify meaning. Essentially, syntax sets the stage for several potential interpretations and only the flow of information in a specific utterance points to the correct choice. Moreover, some constructions are only identifiable through contextual analysis, such as the many clause-combining structures that link phrases pragmatically without syntactic integration. Consequently, the discourse-functional approach used here has proven especially useful for painting a comprehensive picture of the Khatso language. The research and analysis presented in this dissertation differ significantly from previous efforts to describe the language. In addition to identifying the basic building blocks - phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and the lexicon - there is an emphasis on capturing Khatso the way it is spoken in daily life. Natural language data were gathered during nearly a year of fieldwork in Xingmeng, via both audio and video recordings, creating a large multimedia corpus of the language. Transcriptions of the recordings formed the foundation for the investigation, which follows a discourse-functional approach to linguistic analysis. As a result, this grammar is the most comprehensive analysis of Khatso yet, providing an in-depth look at the features, structures and systems that interact to comprise this unique language. It is also the first major study of the language in English. Khatso (kha55tso31 [special characters omitted]; also Katso, Kazhuo [special characters omitted], Gazhuo [special characters omitted] and Yunnan Mongolian; ISO 639-3:kaf) is an endangered Ngwi (or Yi) language spoken in Xingmeng, a single farming village in Yunnan, China. Khatso speakers, who number about 5600 people, are descendants of the Mongolian soldiers Kublai Khan brought to Yunnan in the 13th century, and they still identify as Mongolian today. The language has evolved considerably through language contact, however, and is now considered part of the central branch of the Ngwi language family within the Tibeto-Burman phylum. Khatso is a tonal language that is both analytic and isolating. The phonology is similar to that of most Ngwi languages, with the exception of its relatively large eight-tone system. Tone sandhi is triggered by a variety of phonological, syntactic and discourse factors. There is very little morphology in the language, and most of the lexicon consists of monosyllabic and disyllabic monomorphemes. There is a rich classifier system, which also marks number and specific reference. Typical word order is SV/APV, though there is a great deal of flexibility in discourse. Simple noun modifiers follow nouns, but relative clauses precede them. Serial verb constructions are frequent, and may describe one- and two-event situations. There is no verbal inflection; the aspectual system is indicated by grammatical particles. There is also no evidential system, but both the interrogative and emphatic marker inventories include morphemes that convey epistemic information. Almost all of the Khatso are bilingual in Mandarin or the local Yunnan dialect, because that is the only way to communicate with outsiders. Chinese is also the only language used in school and mastering it is necessary to pursue an education or find employment outside the town. Children continue to learn the language, but many parents teach them Chinese first and Khatso second. Moreover, there is no writing system; the language is not supported by print media or technology. As a result, the vitality of the language is eroding rapidly. This dissertation is part of larger project to document Khatso in order to help preserve and revitalize the language.",,,
114,Capturing Complete Mental Health Among Adolescents: Investigation of Covitality Latent Class Typologies,"Utilizing a strengths-based framework, the proposed study sought to build upon and respond to recommendations in the literature regarding conducting more holistic assessments of adolescent mental health. First, an overview of various models of positive based mental health and adolescent development frameworks, including the newly developed model of covitality---a combination of 12 core positive psychological schemas that are associated with student's positive mental health---is provided. Using a diverse sample of 12,279 adolescents from 17 high schools in California, this study implemented a three-part mixture model (latent profile and class analysis) to investigate underlying mental health profiles among adolescents. Specifically, profiles underlying student covitality were first explored in detail. Subsequently, a latent class investigation of adolescent psychosocial distress was conducted using ratings of externalization and internalization symptoms. Next, a dual-component measurement model was implemented to provide an example of a potential application of the covitality construct as part of a dual-factor method for screening for complete mental health among adolescents. A three-step model for inclusion of covariates was also implemented to better understand how students from different sociocultural backgrounds and schools might uniquely experience mental health. Post-hoc investigations of adolescent risk behavior, quality of school life, and academic achievement are also reported for each covitality profile. Implications for researchers and practitioners interested in conducting strengths-based investigations of complete mental health among adolescents from a dual-component framework are provided.",,,
115,Examining the Thermochemistry and Trace Element Geochemistry of Magma Mixing and Hybridization using Exploratory Modeling,"This occurs when the enthalpy of the mixed system is high enough that fusion of pre-existing crystals in M and/or R creates a sparsely phyric H magma. Results showed that under diabatic conditions the trace element concentrations in H melt could lie outside the range of values in M and R melts due to partitioning effects associated with fractional crystallization. Modeling trace element ratios during serial recharge showed that the bulk composition of each H fell on a mixing hyperbola defined by M and R, as expected, but that the melt phase of H did not necessarily define a hyperbola from which the original components M and R could be constrained unless the trace element ratios used to form the ratio-ratio coordinates had equal partition coefficients, always the case when isotope ratio - isotope ratio diagrams are considered. Statistical analysis of the MC realizations revealed that 44% of the outcomes were three-phase invariant point outcomes, illuminating a thermodynamic invariant point 'attractor' effect that may be relevant to crystallization (and partial melting) in the upper mantle and crust. Ten to twenty per cent of MC realizations exhibited a thermal anomaly such that the final temperature of hybridized magma was less than the initial temperature of both M and R magmas. This thermal anomaly phenomenon was verified using the Magma Chamber Simulator (MCS) and revealed a _0.8 degree drop in H temperature for every percent increase in the crystal content of M magma when R magma is entirely molten. Investigation of the reaction of sub-solidus or mushy stoped blocks with M magma showed that when the mass of M is much greater than the mass of stoped blocks (common condition), the final temperature of H was more strongly dependent on the stoped block mineral mode than its temperature. The results show that the most incompatible elements are enriched in the melt of the RFCAE chamber even though the additions to the chamber (recharge and wallrock assimilation) were not particularly enriched relative to the initial magma. This result suggests a possible alternative process for producing enriched eruptive products (e.g., E-MORB) that does not invoke mixing of enriched subsolidus sources coupled to variable extents of partial melting of the mixed source and subsequent unmodified ascent and eruption. Although the Toy model is simple, it is not simplistic: it does provide insight into a variety of petrogenetic mechanisms. Investigations into phase change systematics revealed that cessation of precipitation of the saturation phase of M occurred even when the mixing ratio (mass ratio of M to R) was large. Extensive trace element experimentation was conducted. Results showed that serial isobaric FC-R-FC hybridization can produce trace element signatures consistent with clinopyroxene crystallization in an equilibrium basalt with only glass + plagioclase phenocrysts present, offering an alternative explanation of the 'pyroxene paradox' of MORB petrogenesis. Some results showed that despite significantly elevated concentrations of trace elements in an incoming R melt, H melt may exhibit essentially no enrichment outside the range of measurement. Further experimentation resulted in a 'Dilution Effect' where a trace element concentration in the melt phase of H was lower than in both initial magmas M and R. The model is also capable of simulating partial melting of a mixture of subsolidus sources through the addition of enthalpy to the subsolidus source. Once the thermodynamic calculations are completed and the phase assemblages pre- and post-hybridization are known, trace element and isotope mass balances are performed. Hence the result of any Recharge hybridization (R-hybridization) or Recharge Fractional Crystallization (RFC-hybridization) process gives complete thermodynamic characterization of the final state consonant with energy and mass conservation. Several applications are presented as examples. In several cases the Magma Chamber Simulator (Bohrson et al., 2013) is used to verify the applicability of the model. A Monte Carlo (MC) method is used to study the statistics of possible outcomes given a range of initial condition values. Magma mixing is a common petrogenetic process occurring in mid-oceanic ridge, oceanic island and island arc petrotectonic environments. An exploratory model was developed and used to investigate fundamental principles underlying magma hybridization. Unlike many geochemical models that satisfy mass balance only, the Toy model is a rigorous thermodynamic model which satisfies energy conservation as well as major, minor, trace and isotopic conservation expressions. Magma hybridization is defined as two or more disparate magmas, each in internal equilibrium, being mixed thoroughly enough to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium. The phase diagram used in this model is that of an isobaric binary eutectic system with no crystalline solution and zero enthalpy of mixing, similar to the model 'basalt' system CaMgSi2O6-CaAl2Si2O8. There are three possible phases in this system that can coexist in different proportions: alpha crystals, beta crystals or melt. The two components of the system are A and B with alpha phase pure component A and beta phase pure component B. There are five possible phase assemblages in this system: L, alpha+L, beta+L, Le+alpha+beta or alpha+beta, where L denotes melt and Le denotes eutectic melt. Eight thermodynamic parameters define the phase diagram including the melting temperature of each pure phase, distinct liquid and solid isobaric heat capacities, the enthalpy of fusion of pure alpha and beta crystals and the eutectic temperature and eutectic composition. Five initial mixing conditions are required to define a magma hybridization outcome involving the mixing of two distinct magmas (M and R) to form a H&barbelow;ybrid magma (H): the initial temperatures and bulk compositions of resident M&barbelow;agma (M) and R&barbelow;echarge magma (R) and the mass fraction (fo) of M in the M+R mixture. The enthalpy of H magma is calculated based upon either an adiabatic or diabatic assumption. MCS R-hybridization simulation data analyzed in major oxide ratio-ratio space were used to explore the ramifications of fractional crystallization and subsequent crystal separation on two related hybrid magma H's differing only in their M to R mixing ratio. The results confirm the issue set forth in the 'pyroxene paradox' of MORB petrogenesis, where sparsely-phyric or aphyric basalts can contain glass that exhibits trace element trends indicative of specific phenocryst crystallization, even though that phenocryst is not present modally in the sampled lavas. Results from serial application of the binary eutectic model illustrate some possible physical and trace element and isotopic geochemical trends arising from the processes associated with a shallow crustal magma chamber undergoing magma mixing via recharge, fractional crystallization associated with heat loss to wallrock, assimilation of subsolidus hydrothermally altered mafic wallrock, and periodic eruption (RFCAE).",,,
116,Marking the Unexpected: Evidence from Navajo to Support a Metadiscourse Domain,"In typological research on mirativity, discussion often centers on the relationship between mirativity, evidentiality, and epistemic modality (Chafe & Nichols 1987; DeLancey 1997, 2012; Aikhenvald 2004, 2012; Peterson 2010). However, in individual languages, speakers mobilize pragmatic extensions that may differentially blend the categorical distinctions. Athabaskan languages have played a particularly important role in this discussion (DeLancey 2001 cited in Peterson 2010) due to the presence of particles that are said to clearly encode mirativity independent of evidentiality, evidence that mirativity warrants a distinct grammatical category. This paper analyzes the function and distribution of the Navajo enclitic la as it is used by speakers in interaction, based on the Navajo Conversational Corpus (Mithun ed 2015 NSF-DEL project 0853598). In its most frequent use, la functions as an interrogative enclitic to mark information questions (Reichard 1951; Young & Morgan 1987; Willie 1996), however this same form may encode what has been described as mirativity. Like other miratives, la may mark surprise, counter-expectation, discovery, and even reported speech (DeLancey 1990, 1997, 2001; Aikhenvald 2004, 2012). Though the two are seemingly unrelated synchronically, a close examination of the pragmatic functions of these enclitics, as well as consideration of comparative Athabaskan evidence, shows that the two enclitics both provide metadiscourse commentary through contrastive focus on the unexpectedness of a proposition. These data contribute to the goal of better understanding how speakers mark new and surprising information in conversation (Aikhenvald 2004), and also support the interactional relevance of the semantic domain of expectation, subsuming both contrastive focus and surprise (Behrens 2012).",,,
117,Surprises at the edge : theoretical investigations at the boundaries of quantum Hall systems,"The quantum Hall effect is recognized as one of the earliest examples of a topological phase of matter. Yet, thirty-five years after its initial discovery, there remain many open questions, especially surrounding states that may host fractional excitations and exotic statistics. Through the bulk-edge correspondence, many questions can be answered by studying the low-energy edge excitations. In this thesis, we investigate analytically certain aspects of the edge excitations using Chern-Simons-Landau-Ginzburg theory. The results include some surprises: our microwave absorption proposal leads to an interferometer whose read-out is first order in the tunneling amplitude; tunneling current across a quantum point contact is affected by the presence of a neutral mode; and the bulk-edge correspondence for chiral Abelian phases can be one-to-many. We now describe these investigations in more detail. We next consider transport through a quantum point contact in states with counter-propagating neutral edge modes. We show that both the noise and the average transmitted current are affected by downstream perturbations within the standard edge state model. We argue that the change in transmitted current should be observable in experiments that have observed increased noise. We start by proposing an experiment to measure the microwave absorption spectrum of a quantum Hall droplet. We show that the number and velocities of charged edge modes can be directly measured from a droplet of known shape. In contrast to standard transport measurements, different edge equilibration regimes can be accessed in the same device. If there is a quantum point contact, then quasiparticle properties, including braiding statistics, can be observed. Their effects are manifested as modulations of the spectrum that are, notably, first-order in the tunneling amplitude at the point contact. Finally, we investigate the bulk-edge correspondence for chiral Abelian quantum Hall phases. We show that the same bulk two-dimensional topological phase can have multiple distinct, fully-chiral edge phases. This can happen for both integer and fractional quantum Hall states. We give a general criterion for the existence of multiple distinct chiral edge phases for the same bulk phase and discuss experimental consequences. We find that edge phases correspond to lattices while bulk phases correspond to genera of lattices. Since there are typically multiple lattices in a genus, the bulk-edge correspondence is typically one-to-many.",,,
118,How Migrant Parents in Beijing Care for Their Children : A Comparison Study on Parenting Strategies Between Poor and Not-so-poor Migrant Parents,"This paper seeks to contribute to the understanding of how internal migration in globalizing China shapes migrant parents' decision to raise their children. The case study focuses on how do poor and not-so-poor migrant parents care for their children both from afar and close by. The findings on which it is based come from three main sources. The first consisted of twenty semi-structured interviews with migrant parents and their now-adult children from different social-economic backgrounds in Beijing, China. The second source comes from participant observation at a migrant children's school in Beijing. The third source comes from archival research in California, where I gather the push-pull factors for migration within China, as well as the institutional barriers that prevents rural migrant parents and their children from utilizing social services in urban cities. Drawing from existing scholarship on China's globalizing economy, hukou reform, feminization of migration, and children of migration, I attempt to examine what does migrant family structures reveal about China's institutional discrimination? How do poor and not-so-poor migrant parents in Beijing care for their children? And how does migration effect now-adult children's outlook on life and work? By studying this topic, I hope to deepen the understanding of the social cost of migration on family relationships and children behind China's aggressive economic development. Moreover, this study aims to elevate the discussion of migrant families from the margins of scholarly research to a position of greater centrality.",,,
119,"Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Retinal Pigmented Epithelium : Methods, Lines, and Behaviors","In addition, this dissertation will elucidate other effects of ROCK inhibition on hESC-RPE. ROCK inhibition is known to affect cytoskeletal rearrangements and we will show that ROCK inhibition can promote wound closure and attachment through increased cell cycle activation and cell spreading respectively. Elucidating these effects and beginning to understand the mechanisms of wound healing and attachment is critical when considering ROCK inhibition as a novel treatment for geographic atrophy, a late stage phenotype of AMD, and as a potential combinational therapy with cellular replacement to enhance engraftment. Ocular diseases affect millions world-wide and dramatically influence the quality of life. Although much is known about ocular biology and disease pathologies, effective treatments are still lacking. The eye is well suited for application of emerging cell-based therapies. This dissertation will explore the development of stem cell-based treatments for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a prevalent ocular disease in the elderly. Retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), a cell type implicated in AMD, has been derived from both human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and human embryonic stem cells (hESC). Rapidly advancing research has generated various methods of RPE differentiation and several transplantation strategies. The following chapters will provide an in-depth overview and characterization of hESC-RPE and iPSC-RPE across two methods of derivation. Human embryonic stem cell derived retinal pigmented epithelium (hESC-RPE) is in clinical trials for the treatment of macular diseases. Currently, these cells take over three months to derive and subsequent months to mature and characterize. After only four to five passages the cells begin to undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and are unsuitable for cellular therapies. We show in this dissertation that inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) using specific inhibitor, Y-27632, can increase the lifespan and proliferation rate of hESC-RPE in culture. hESC-RPE maintain typical cuboidal morphology, gene expression, protein localization, factor secretion, and phagocytic abilities up to passage 13 following ROCK inhibition. In the final chapter, the creation of a molecular tool basket will be described. As hESC-RPE progress through the phases of clinical trials, it will be important to gain a better understanding of how the cells behave in vivo to address any potential caveats within the clinical trials. Fluorescent reporters that monitor transplanted cell migration, function and mitotic stage have been created to examine, in real time, how the stem cell derived transplant is affected by the endogenous retinal milieu. The findings within this dissertation have tremendous implications in understanding the variability between hESC-RPE and iPSC-RPE and the various methods of derivation as these cellular therapies move into the clinics. In addition, the benefits of ROCK inhibition on hESC-RPE and iPSC-RPE could lead to combinational therapies and help produce large intermediate cell banks if clinical trials prove efficient and a large scale cell production is required. Pluripotent stem cell derived RPE have unique cellular characteristics. This dissertation will also examine various RPE behaviors upon manipulation with a synthetic kinase inhibitor and describe the creation and production of exogenous reporters that can be used for real-time monitoring of cellular transplantations.",,,
120,Turn-Taking Mechanisms in the Repeated Volunteer's Dilemma,"Two individuals have a regular task to complete that requires the effort of only one. Some days it is less costly for one of the individuals to complete the task, and some days it is less costly for the other individual. Each knows only their own cost. Taking turns is fair, but rigid turn-taking cannot account for changing costs. The person obligated might not be best suited for the job. A natural solution is to allow some flexibility - swapping turns when efficient. These arrangements are so familiar, we rarely think of them as economic mechanisms, but doing so provides interesting insights into their properties and performance. In the first chapter of this dissertation, I model flexible turn-taking as a simple dynamic mechanism (recurring rotation) and derive theoretical properties of the mechanism. In the second chapter, I present results of an experiment designed to test these properties. Although the efficiency achieved by subjects is close to the expected efficiency, behavioral anomalies that cannot be explained by social preferences or strategic concerns suggest that subjects may be used to a different form of flexible turn-taking. An alternative form of flexible turn-taking (obligation takeover) retains familiar structure, is consistent with patterns of subject behavior, and can achieve approximately the same efficiency as an optimal mechanism using money transfers under uniformly distributed costs. I present this in the third chapter.",,,
121,A Transalpine Theatrical Conversation : French Medieval Farce and Italian Renaissance Comedy,"In exploring the use of specific units of French farce in Tuscan comedy, this study aims to elucidate the ways in which a revised poetics of imitation within select experimental literary academies of the Renaissance not only favored the transgression of classical models but also triggered the explosive growth of hybrid genres. Finally, intercalation of French farce in Italian comedy sheds new light on the integration of Renaissance Italian theatrical culture in France at the end of the sixteenth century and raises issues of ""international relations"" in the field of theatrical studies. This study analyzes the experimental use of units of theater from the medieval French farce tradition in Pierantonio Stricca Legacci's Cilombrino (1518), Salvestro Cartaio's Il Travaglio (The Torment) (1552), and Antonfrancesco Grazzini's L'Arzigogolo (The Quibble) (c. 1580). It asks questions such as: Did French military presence in Italy or the substantial Italian population in France have a specific effect on the theatrical productions of the sixteenth century? For what reasons would the French farce have appealed to experimental Tuscan literary academies of the sixteenth century, and how would Tuscan playwrights have come into contact with the French genre? In what ways were units of farce appropriated as models of progressive theater for and by these academies? Finally, what role did politics play in the comedic creations of the sixteenth-century theater? Could only laughter speak the truth to power as embodied by the French monarchy and the Medici regime? How did this hybrid comic theater critique the conventions of humanist imitation? By examining the formal relationships between medieval French farce and Italian Renaissance comedy through close investigation of thematic and textual borrowings, as well as stagecraft, this study authenticates Tuscan comedy as a ""contact zone"" for transalpine intercultural exchange, involving both material exchanges (print, letters, staging features, audio-visual effects) and semiotic ones (symbols, themes, topoi). The French farce appealed to the experimental, avant-garde Tuscan dramatists of the sixteenth century as a model from which to appropriate a new kind of comic theater. Through the intercalation of Tuscan drama with the French farce, playwrights of the Congrega dei Rozzi in Siena and the Accademia degli Umidi in Florence created some of the first examples of hybrid genres of early modern theater; this intertextual phenomenon continued to gain popularity throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By probing the connection between politics and the French farce, I show how inimitably suited this genre was to the needs of sixteenth-century Tuscan dramatists. This theatrical tradition allowed for the representation of key social tensions and contradictions that humanist comedy may otherwise have been unable to express theatrically without threatening to disrupt and undermine social stability. With an emphasis on interaction of theatrical forms, as well as a focus on the social, cultural, and historical factors that influenced these cultural productions, this dissertation offers a socio-semiotic reading of the construction of early modern European comedy, particularly in regard to humanism, imitation, and international cultural exchange.",,,
122,The Dark Side of Growth,"As billions of dollars are being invested in construction, construction workers are the physical driving force behind the UAE's infrastructural development and overall growth. Despite being an integral component to decreasing the dependence on oil rents and diversifying the economy through construction, workers in this industry are severely mistreated. This study seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of workers' rights in the construction industry in the UAE. The central research question framing this study is: what are the labor violations faced by workers and to what degree has the UAE government responded to these issues? The follow up questions are then, have working conditions improved and what are the challenges in improving these conditions? This study employs a qualitative approach, drawing on current literature in order to answer the central research questions. The discussion in this paper is based on an analysis of the information collected through archival research and is divided into 7 chapters. The penultimate chapter of this thesis features a case study of Abu Dhabi's $27 billion megaproject, Saayidat Island, which is home to the new Guggenheim, Louvre, and New York University (NYU) satellite campus. This current case study will be used in order to examine the status of workers' rights violations and the level of enforcement of government policy on labor issues. After a review of government policy on labor, this paper concludes that the UAE does not lack legislation on labor issues, but rather lacks enforcement of these laws. Thus, this study finds that the largest hurdles to enforcing labor laws is the level of crony capitalism between the government and the construction industry and the disposability of labor. This study hypothesizes that the partnerships Abu Dhabi is building with big international names at Saayidat Island, like the Guggenheim and Louvre museums and also universities like New York University, may serve as a tipping point and bring more international scrutiny to violations of workers' rights in this industry. The hope is that mounting international pressure, as seen in Qatar leading up to the 2022 World Cup, will encourage the UAE to go beyond responding to these issues at the institutional level and motivate them to enforce the labor laws on the ground. In the 1960s the United Arab Emirates (UAE) struck oil. Over the years, the UAE has increasingly invested in an array of sectors to reduce economic dependence on hydrocarbon exports. All sectors that the UAE is actively investing in, are not only global but require infrastructure development. Between the Emirates of Dubai and Abu Dhabi there are currently about 1,300 construction projects in development worth over $418 billion (Sonmez et al., 2011). The Emirates lack the domestic labor force required to support these construction endeavors. For this reason, the UAE is largely dependent on migrant labor.",,,
123,The Distributional Learning of Multi-Word Expressions: A Computational Approach,"One area of research on distributional learning algorithms in which there remains relatively little work is the learning of multi-word, memorized, formulaic sequences, based on the co-occurrences of words. Examples of such multi-word expressions (MWEs) include kick the bucket, New York City, sit down, and as a matter of fact. In this dissertation, I present a novel computational approach to the distributional learning of such sequences in corpora. Entitled MERGE (Multi-word Expressions from the Recursive Grouping of Elements), my algorithm iteratively works by (1) assigning a statistical 'attraction' score to each two-word sequence (bigram) in a corpus, based on the individual and co-occurrence frequencies of these two words in that corpus; and (2) merging the highest-scoring bigram into a single, lexicalized unit. These two steps then repeat until some maximum number of iterations or minimum score threshold is reached (since, broadly speaking, the winning score progressively decreases with increasing iterations). Because one (or both) of the 'words' making up a winning bigram may be an output merged item from a previous iteration, the algorithm is able to learn MWEs that are in principle of any length (e.g., apple pie versus I'll believe it when I see it). Moreover, these MWEs may contain one or more discontinuities of different sizes, up to some maximum size threshold (measured in words) specified by the user (e.g., as _ as in as tall as and as big as). Typically, the extraction of MWEs has been handled by algorithms that identify only continuous sequences, and in which the user must specify the length(s) of the sequences to be extracted beforehand; thus, MERGE offers a bottom-up, distributional-based approach that addresses these issues. Finally, in a study using two corpora of caregiver-child interactions, I run MERGE on caregiver utterances and then show that, of the MWEs induced by the algorithm, those that go on to be later acquired by the children receive higher scores by the algorithm than those that do not go on to be learned. These results suggest that, when applied to acquisition data, the algorithm is useful for identifying the structures of statistical co-occurrences in the caregiver input that are relevant to children in their acquisition of early multi-word knowledge. In the present dissertation, in addition to describing the algorithm, I report three rating experiments and one corpus-based early child language study that validate the efficacy of MERGE in identifying MWEs. In one experiment, participants rate sequences extracted from a corpus by the algorithm for how well they instantiate true MWEs. As expected, the results reveal that the high-scoring output items that MERGE identifies early in its iterative process are rated as 'good' MWEs by participants (based on certain subjective criteria), with the quality of these ratings decreasing for output from later iterations (i.e., output items that were scored lower by the algorithm). There has been much recent research in corpus and computational linguistics on distributional learning algorithms---computer code that induces latent linguistic structures in corpus data based on co-occurrences of transcribed units in that data. These algorithms have varied applications, from the investigation of human cognitive processes to the corpus extraction of relevant linguistic structures for lexicographic, second language learning, or natural language processing applications, among others. They also operate at various levels of linguistic structure, from phonetics to syntax. Overall, MERGE is shown to be a powerful computational approach to the distributional learning and extraction of MWEs, both when modeling adult knowledge of formulaic language, and when accounting for the early multi-word structures acquired by children. In the other two experiments, participants rate high-ranking output both from MERGE and from an existing algorithm from the literature that also learns MWEs of various lengths---the Adjusted Frequency List (Brook O'Donnell 2011). Comparison of participant ratings reveals that the items that MERGE acquires are rated more highly than those acquired by the Adjusted Frequency List, suggesting that MERGE is a performance frontrunner among distributional learning algorithms of MWEs. More broadly, together the experiments suggest that MERGE acquires representations that are compatible with adult knowledge of formulaic language, and thus it may be useful for any number of research applications that rely on such formulaic language as a unit of analysis.",,,
124,"The 51%: Gender, Feminism, and Culture in the Occupy Wall Street Movement","Social movements researchers have explained that gender inequality and hierarchies shape social movements, feminist movements are taking new forms within a variety of institutions and contexts, and contemporary social movements are shaped by second wave feminism, contemporary feminism, and antifeminist backlash. Scholars of gender and organizations have identified changes in cultural beliefs toward gender equality and the greater inclusion of women in the workplace but also the persistence of traditional gender stereotypes and continued reliance on men's leadership in contemporary workplace contexts and the family. Yet, we know little about how these patterns of gender inequality, gender egalitarianism, and new forms of feminism shape contemporary mixed-gender social movements. Emerging as a mass mobilization in September 2011, the Occupy Wall Street Movement (Occupy) is an ideal case to examine gender, feminism and culture. ""We are the 99%"" became the key slogan of the movement, symbolizing class-based solidarity in opposition to the most wealthy 1%, the government, corporations, and banks. To build an inclusive and multi-issue movement, participants attempted to develop a non-hierarchical and egalitarian organizational structure and the 99% identity. The study draws on qualitative and quantitative data including participant observation, an archive of paper and electronic documents about the movement, semi-structured in-depth interviews with 73 participants, and the Occupy Research Demographic and Political Participation Survey (n=~5000). The analysis employs an intersectional and feminist approach. I argue that during the first year of the movement's emergence and development, gender conflict was central to the movement's organizational structure, collective identity, tactics, and strategies, and the emergence of feminist spin-off mobilizations. The organizational structure of Occupy was not inherently ""bad,"" but like many organizations, even egalitarian ones, attempts to change patterns of gender inequality often failed because the practices that created and recreated inequality were so deeply and often invisibly embedded in everyday habits, or as I refer to them, ""gendered toolkits."" Occupy grew to be disproportionately male-dominated due to leaderlessness, structurelessness, and the threat of aggressive policing. Finally, while gender conflict was pervasive and weakened Occupy, gender conflict was also productive and contributed to the development of feminist collective identity, feminist free spaces, and feminist bridge leaders in Occupy. New feminist mobilizations drew on the resources of and, at the same time, reinvigorated existing feminist organizations and networks. In Occupy, gender conflict along with gender egalitarianism and expressions of sexism alongside feminism, point to the successes of, as well as the backlash against feminist movements, and the profound resilience of gender inequality. Occupy's gender regime demonstrated striking similarity to a variety of organizations and contexts affected by limited and uneven gender equality, or what I argue has been one of the most recent and vibrant examples of the ""stalled gender revolution"" manifesting within the context of social movements. Furthermore, ""the 99%"" obscured the diversity among participants and marginalized women and people of color by failing to recognize their distinct grievances and disproportionate economic hardships leading to a variety of oppositional collective identities and spin-off mobilizations. Many of the protest performances replicated male-dominated gendered toolkits from other contexts and social movements. The study reveals that gender conflict within the movement led participants to develop two different kinds of gendered tactics: sexist tactics that conveyed male-dominance and marginalized women and other minority groups, and liberatory tactics that challenged gender inequality and borrowed from the tactical repertoires of third wave and contemporary feminist movements and lesbian, gay, and transgender movements.",,,
125,Transnational Arms Flows in the Syrian Civil War,"This paper looks at small arms transfers to non-state actors in the Syrian conflict as an under analyzed aspect of intervention in intrastate war that is both globalized and potentially destabilizing. I challenge the dominant narrative that the international community has failed to intervene in Syria, by pointing to the manifold government-funded arms transfers to opposition groups beginning in 2012. I find that there are two significant networks of arms trafficking: one through Jordan with Saudi Arabian and American support; the other through Turkey with Qatari support. These patterns and rivalries between donor countries have contributed to three processes within the transformation from revolution to civil war: militarization, increased sectarianism, and fragmentation of the opposition. I review two mechanisms of international arms control: multilateral embargoes and the recent Arms Trade Treaty. Their weaknesses, as evident in the case of Syria, are related to the problems of self-monitoring and enforcement by states that have contradictory incentives. Next, I address the related issue of surplus arms by looking at how the failure of disarmament measures in Iraq and Libya had a direct impact on arms proliferation in Syria. I conclude with a discussion of the legality of arms transfers to non-state actors and the need to focus on political rather than military solutions to globalized conflict.",,,
126,An Ergodic Algorithm for Generating Random Knots with a Thickness Constraint,"The data from this algorithm will show that the radius of gyration increases strongly with thickness, in that the growth exponent for radius of gyration increases with thickness. It also shows how knotting is decreased by the addition of a thickness constraint. The first algorithm for sampling the space of thick equilateral knots, as a function of thickness, will be described. This algorithm is based on previous algorithms of applying random reflections. To prove the usefulness of the algorithm, we create a method for turning any knot into the regular planar polygon using only thickness non-decreasing moves. This ensures that the algorithm has a positive probability of connecting any two knots with the required thickness constraint and so is ergodic. This ergodic sampling allows us to analyze the effects of thickness on properties of the geometric knot such as radius of gyration and knotting.",,,
127,Clinical Correlates of Social Affect in Early Infancy: Implications for Early Identification of Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Earlier intervention for infants and toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) enhances developmental gains (Rogers, et al. 2012) and necessitates ascertainment of early, reliable indicators of ASD. Diminished social attention and positive social affect have been among the leading hypothesized risk factors for ASD in the prelinguistic period, between 6-12 months of age, however research has resulted in mixed findings for the predictive value of social engagement in 6-9-month-old infants for the development of ASD. If abnormalities in infant social affect contribute to the early phenotypic expression of ASD, it is important to determine whether diminished social affect is a unique construct associated exclusively with social impairments or if it is, alternatively, an expression of normal variation in individual development better explained by temperamental style. Further research is needed to understand how diminished positive social affect in early infancy may impact later developmental outcomes. Implications for early identification of ASD and relevant intervention strategies are discussed. The current study sought to enhance the understanding of social development in early infancy by investigating individual differences in social engagement during face-to-face dyadic interactions. Expression of positive social affect during a structured dyadic parent-infant interaction was measured for 33 typically developing 6-8-month old infants. This measure was then correlated with concurrent clinical measures of social-communication, vocal production, autism symptomology, and temperament. Results revealed a positive association between positive social affect and the receptive language component of social-communication. No significant relations were observed between positive social affect, vocal production, autism symptomology, or temperament. These results suggest that infant positive social during interaction with a caregiver is a reflection of some elements of social-communicative ability for 6-8 month old infants, but not temperamental style.",,,
128,Exploring pathways to posttraumatic growth,"This study explored the following question: How do experiences of positive affect and social support influence an individual's posttraumatic growth? The following variables were measured: positive affect (pre- and post-PTE), perceived social support (pre- and post-PTE), rumination, and posttraumatic growth. Utilizing a descriptive field design, all participants were contacted through email to complete an online web-based survey. One hundred and twenty-seven individuals participated in this study. Seventy-four percent were female, the average age was 20.27 years (SD = 2.53), and participants were predominantly Caucasian (32.3%), Latino/a/Chicano/a (21.3%), and Asian (20.5%). Regression analyses revealed that perceived social support after a potentially traumatic event was significantly predictive of an individual's posttraumatic growth. Results of path analyses before and after a potentially traumatic event (PTE) show significant indirect and direct effects for the variables of positive affect and perceived social support. These results suggest the usefulness of focusing on increasing positive affect and perceived social support when designing interventions for survivors of potentially traumatic events. A model of influence was tested that examined the direct and indirect role of rumination in the hypothesized influence of positive affect upon posttraumatic growth, revealing that rumination, as well as the subscales of brooding and depression, significantly increased posttraumatic growth. These results suggest a need for future research to examine the varied role rumination has in relation to posttraumatic growth.",,,
129,"Pathways between Trauma, Schizoid Personality Traits, and Substance Problems Among Males on Probation","I found that childhood trauma was significantly and positively related to schizoid personality traits, and that it had an indirect, positive effect on substance problems. Specifically, schizoid personality mediated the relationship between trauma and substance problems. Trauma appeared to increase substance problems through the pathway it shared with schizoid personality traits, yet not through the pathway of social support. Results show that schizoid personality had a positive, significant association with substance problems, while social support was not significantly related to the outcome. There was no evidence that social support mediated the relation of schizoid personality and substance problems. Hence, a lack of social support did not explain why individuals higher on schizoid traits used alcohol or drugs in problematic ways. The study calls for intervention models that incorporate personality assessments for enhancing services to fit with interpersonal styles of clients. Screening for substance use behaviors is not sufficient when treating youths who committed crimes; assessing trauma history and personality style are important elements for treatment planning. Social support as a strength may not buffer the effects of trauma and schizoid personality traits, so that alternative or additional strengths should be assessed and incorporated into the treatment of adolescents who struggle with antisocial behaviors such as criminal activity and substance use. Mood and substance use disorders are prevalent among incarcerated youths. Much research has focused on externalizing symptoms of juvenile males with a criminal record, and little is known about introverted personality types. Schizoid personality traits lie on the introversion personality dimension and have specific characteristics that represent potentially maladaptive intra- and interpersonal styles. A latent variable approach explored pathways between childhood trauma, schizoid personality traits, and substance problems among 1,029 juvenile males who committed an offense. Trauma, schizoid personality traits, and social support were specified as predictors, and substance problems represented the outcome of a structural equation model. The model tested whether or not social support was a mediator for the association between schizoid personality and substance problems. Moreover, I was interested in the association between trauma, schizoid personality, and substance problems.",,,
130,Image Reconstruction for Multistatic Stepped Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) Ultrasound Imaging Systems With Reconfigurable Arrays,"This research work investigates a multistatic, stepped-FMCW modality as an alternative to array phasing in order to accommodate the flexible and reconfigurable nature of an array. A space-time reconstruction algorithm was developed for the imaging system. We include ultrasound imaging experiments and describe a simulation method for quickly predicting imaging performance for any given target and array configuration. Lastly, we demonstrate two reconstruction techniques for improving image resolution. The first takes advantage of the statistical significance of pixel contributions prior to the final summation, and the second corrects data errors originating from the stepped-FMCW quadrature receiver. The standard architecture of a medical ultrasound transducer is a linear phased array of piezoelectric elements in a compact, hand-held form. Acoustic energy not directly reflected back towards the transducer elements during a transmit-receive cycle amounts to lost information for image reconstruction. To mitigate this loss, a large, flexible transducer array which conforms to contours of the subject's body would result in a greater effective aperture and an increase in received image data. However, in this reconfigurable array design, element distributions are irregular and an organized arrangement can no longer be assumed. Phased array architecture also has limited scalability potential for large 2D arrays.",,,
131,Threats to romantic relationships : How they are perceived and how they are guarded against in an uncommon mate market,"To avoid the costs of a mate's infidelity, ""fidelity"" is predicted to rank highly among a suite of reproductive success-enhancing traits. Specifically, I predicted that men would highly value ""sexual fidelity"" and women would highly value ""emotional fidelity"". I evaluated community and university members' responses to a zero-sum allocation task using various quantitative statistics. My predictions were largely supported: Both community and university men highly valued sexual fidelity in a mate. Additional analysis revealed university men were an adequate proxy for community men vis-a-vis mate preferences. Data from community women supported the prediction by highly valuing emotional fidelity in a mate. Conversely, university women most valued sexual fidelity; they least-valued cues of resource acquisition, counter to standard sexual selection logic and multiple previous studies of university women. This suggested the presence of an uncommon mate market affecting university women's preferences. Because jealousy is an adaptive response to a (suspected) loss to a romantic rival, a facultative response should account for the traits of rivals in the local mating environment. Using the same unobtrusive, mixed-methods design as the study described above, I evaluated the prediction that jealousy responds facultatively. Specifically, men with many attractive---and, therefore, threatening---rivals are more attentive to their partners' deceptive actions and to their partner's intentions to stay or leave the mateship. Women with many sexually-accessible---and, therefore, threatening---rivals are more attentive to their partners' deceptive actions. The study of jealousy from an adaptationist perspective is dominated by the hypothesis that 1) relationship threats are either sexual or emotional in nature, and 2) there are sex differences in response to these threats. While there is considerable support for sex differences in response to researcher-created stimuli, the notion that people spontaneously conceive of threats as either sexual or emotional threats is untested. Using an unobtrusive, mixed-methods design, I mapped the cognitive space of jealousy. Contrary to conventional supposition, the sexual-emotional distinction is not a primary means of threat organization; instead, threats are organized by 1) their severity, 2) the presence of a specific rival versus a partner's disinterest, and 3) a partner's deceptive actions versus their honesty. A sexual-emotional distinction, if present, is not among the principle means of threat organization. In addition to the analysis of an aggregate population, I also provide analysis of several comparison subpopulations. To describe how an uncommon mate market affected university women's preferences, I conducted long-form, semi-structured interviews, analyzed with framework analysis. The prime mover of university women's mate preferences appears to be the demography and geography of Isla Vista, affecting women's intrasexual competitive tactics and men's responses to them. In this mate market, women find themselves in the uncommon position of being able to use a man's sexual fidelity---typically a noisy signal---as an honest signal of his devotion to the mateship.",,,
132,Ecological impacts of mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa and Rana sierrae) declines on Sierra Nevada lake communities,"Mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa and Rana sierrae) of California's Sierra Nevada have been extirpated from over 90% of their historic range, initially by introduced trout predators, and more recently by the emergence of the lethal amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis). Formerly widespread and abundant, mountain yellow-legged frogs are grazers and highly connected high level predators, living in low diversity, low productivity high elevation lakes. Here, I examine the extent to which frog extinctions impact Sierra Nevada lake communities. First, in a study that combined surveys of benthic macroinvertebrates in 22 lakes over 5 years with a reanalysis of benthic macroinvertebrate community data from over 150 lakes, I found no strong differences in benthic macroinvertebrate community diversity or composition between lakes with frogs vs. lakes without frogs. I also conducted experiments to evaluate the impact of tadpoles as grazers on benthic algae, and found that tadpoles do reduce algal biomass in artificial habitats, but that the effect can be small and may not outweigh the influence that abiotic variability has on algal biomass in lakes. Lastly, while I documented that large and periodic tadpole aggregations create biogeochemical hotspots of dissolved nitrogen, the phenomena may not be widespread enough to drive differences in diatom diversity in lakes with vs. without tadpoles. Within lakes, I found little indication that diatom community diversity and composition were responding to tadpole generated nitrogen hotspots as a fluctuation-dependent mechanism with potential to enhance diatom coexistence. While none of the ecological effects of mountain yellow-legged frogs and tadpoles that I observed suggests that their extinctions are having large impacts on Sierra Nevada lake communities, they should not be discounted as expendable, because there are many other ways in which these amphibians could be important in their communities.",,,
134,Computational Mechanistic Study of the Reactivity of Metal Oxide Catalyst towards Olefins,"The mechanism of ethylene polymerization by the Phillips catalyst remains unknown despite numerous hypotheses and studies since its discovery sixty years ago. This work uses density functional and small chromasiloxane cluster models to compare initiation, propagation, and termination pathways for several previously proposed mechanisms and for two newly proposed mechanisms. Where possible, complete catalytic cycles and predicted kinetics, molecular weights, and site abundances are compared to properties of the Phillips catalyst. Prohibitively high activation barriers for propagation rule out chromacycle ring expansion and Green-Rooney mechanisms (alternating alkylidene/chromacycle). A new oxachromacycle ring expansion mechanism has a favorable plausible propagation barrier, but initiation for the oxachromacycle expansion is prohibitively slow. Chain growth is fast on a recently proposed bridging hydroxyl Si(OH)CrIII-alkyl site that is initiated by proton transfer from ethylene. However, the initiation step is extremely slow and uphill, and termination is even faster than propagation, so essentially all sites remain trapped in a dormant state. A new Si(OH)Cr II-alkyl site also has a small barrier for Cossee-Arlman type chain growth, but it forms only oligomers because termination by proton transfer back to the alkyl chain is faster than propagation, and initiation is slow. Only the monoalkylchromium(III) site (SiO)2Cr-alkyl is viable as an active site for polymerization, however the nature of the initiation mechanism remains unknown. CH3ReO3 (MTO) interacting with the surface of extensively chlorinated gamma-Al2O3 is a highly active catalyst for olefin metathesis. Its activity, selectivity and stability exceed that of any other reported MTO-based catalyst as measured in propene metathesis at 0, including MTO/SiO2-Al2O3 and MTO/ZnCl2/gamma-Al2O3, and are far higher than MTO/gamma-Al2O3. DFT calculations support facile Cl-O ligand exchange between MTO and Cl-Al2O3. The calculations further suggest that chlorination at Re promotes active site formation via tautomerization. Two heterogeneous catalysts, the Phillips ethylene polymerization catalyst and supported rhenium olefin-metathesis catalyst, are computationally investigated.",,,
135,An Exploration of Teachers' Views of Evaluation in a Choice-Based System,"Professional teaching standards developed in California are designed to provide teachers with guiding principles for improved practice and provisions, as well as drive criteria for teacher evaluations. Along with a standards-based evaluation system, many local California districts are offering teachers on cycle and in good standing a choice-based method of evaluation. It is unclear what teachers' reactions to these systems have been, in particular, whether they feel the choice-based evaluation system allows for more meaningful feedback and insight into their strengths and areas of development as a professional educator. With the permission of the superintendent and a district assistant superintendent, five teachers were interviewed in a medium-sized suburban unified school district in California in order to gain a greater perspective into their opinions of the choice-based system of evaluation. With regards to types of evaluation experienced, two teachers emphasized three evaluation choices (peer, portfolio, and administrator) in their interviews; three others generally emphasized evaluation by an administrator. A district assistant superintendent was also interviewed, providing background about the choice-based teacher evaluation system in the district, as well as insight into the overarching practice and protocol of the choice-based system in this particular district. Findings highlighted similarities and differences across the cases. For example, teachers tended to agree that it was best to maintain a choice-based system versus the traditional administrative model. In addition, teachers understood and had a clear vision of the choice-based teacher evaluation process. At times, among teachers who did not select the peer or portfolio option themselves, they nonetheless stressed the advantages of those options. Teachers had varied ideas of what might be helpful in making teacher evaluations in general more effective. The educational landscape is changing and along with the changes is the reform and accountability system of teacher evaluations. As of late, teachers have come under scrutiny for their practice and professionalism in the classroom and many believe we need to hold teachers to higher standards. To that end, recent reforms have been put in place to allow for greater focus and accountability such as the development of new professional standards for teachers.",,,
136,Utilizing Corpus Resources Accompanied By Other Consultation Resources in Enhancing Collocation Accuracy and Collocation Richness in L2 Writing,"In the COCA-based test, they were required to correct the same eight collocation errors by consulting COCA and other consultation resources. Thirty out of 140 students who volunteered to have their corpus consultation videotaped were interviewed later. A mixed-methods approach that included quantitative statistics and qualitative analysis was used. The results show that in COCA performance and improvement, learners successfully induced patterns from COCA consultation and corrected collocation errors. They improved approximately 30% in both collocation accuracy and collocation richness after having access. Additionally, even though learners of higher English proficiency performed better, learners across different levels of English proficiency received a similar amount of assistance from COCA. It is concluded that, for learners of all levels of English proficiency, corpus use accompanied by other consultation resources greatly assisted learners in finding collocations, even though data-driven learning (DDL) itself still caused difficulties for learners in the process. Nonetheless, the advantages outweigh the difficulties. Because the use of external consultation resources helps learners to check unfamiliar vocabulary items encountered in COCA use, the key point is to encourage learners to embrace DDL, as this is different from their previous learning styles. Teachers should inform learners of the benefits of learning collocation through corpus and should guide learners in how to coordinate effectively the use of corpus and other consultation resources. As for COCA use, different learners coordinated the corpus use and other consultation resources differently, and they gained benefits and encountered some difficulties when consulting COCA and other consultation resources. Nevertheless, the number of times they consulted COCA was similar among learners across different levels of English proficiency, but lower proficiency learners utilized more of the external consultation resources. Lastly, the COCA Reflection section shows that learners generally found COCA to be helpful and easy to use, but higher proficiency learners had higher evaluations of COCA use. Nonetheless, they did not necessarily think that COCA was easier to use, compared to lower proficiency learners. Corpus-based pedagogy, in which learners consult a corpus and generate patterns from the corpus, has been shown to be effective in collocation teaching and learning. The present research investigated how 140 English learners from Taiwan corrected different types of collocation errors by consulting the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) accompanied by other consultation resources. Three aspects, including COCA performance and improvement, COCA use, and reflection toward COCA use, have been explored together to provide comprehensive understanding. Students were required to take two tests: a paper-based test and a COCA-based test. The paper-based test required them to correct eight collocation errors of different types (verb+noun collocations vs. adjective+noun collocations; easy collocations vs. difficult collocations; L1 congruent collocations vs. L1 incongruent collocations) adapted from their essay writing, by providing three answers to replace each collocation error.",,,

The techniques range from simple hyperlinks to highly complex functions as in videogames. These works draw from the traditions of print literature as well as from the digital culture that has shaped this era: hypertext, algorithms, text reordering, text fragmentation, multimedia creations, and almost anything else the computer is capable of. As each work discussed here is unique, a different theoretical approach is used for each.",,,
138,Configurable and Sound Static Analysis of JavaScript : Techniques and Applications,"JavaScript is widespread. Web developers use JavaScript to enrich user experience via dynamic content ranging from scripts to enhance a web page's appearance, to full-blown web applications, to extending the functionality of web browsers in the form of browser addons. Desktop developers use JavaScript, e.g., for OS applications in Windows 8. JavaScript's growing prominence means that secure, correct, and fast JavaScript code is becoming ever more critical. Static analysis traditionally plays a large role in providing these characteristics: it can be used for security auditing, error-checking, debugging, optimization, and program refactoring, among other uses. Thus, a sound, precise static analysis platform for JavaScript can be of enormous advantage. In this thesis, we present our work on creating a sound, precise, configurable and fast static analysis for JavaScript called JSAI that we have made openly available to the research community. JSAI is both a practical tool for JavaScript static analysis and also a research platform for experimenting with static analysis techniques. JSAI showcases a number of novel techniques to soundly compute a combination of type inference, pointer analysis, control-flow analysis, string analysis, and integer and boolean constant propagation for JavaScript programs. It also provides a unique method for modularly configuring analysis precision that is based on fundamental new insights into the theory of static analysis. We describe precision-increasing techniques for the analysis using type refinement; and performance-increasing techniques for the analysis based on parallelization of JSAI. As an example use-case for JSAI, we discuss a novel security analysis for JavaScript-based browser addon vetting.",,,
139,"On God's Gestures : Miracles, Laws of Nature, and Special Divine Action","After presenting a survey of the literature, I present two solutions of my own to help the theist. I offer an original account of what is meant by a 'miracle' and an original account of what is meant by a 'law of nature'. However, given the magnitude of Hume's definition of 'miracle', I propose all miracles be defined as Humean, which suggests the solution I adopt is accepting my account of what is meant by a 'law of nature'. This paper largely focuses on miraculous events and laws of nature in lieu of the famous remarks made by David Hume in his ""Of Miracles."" After doing minor expositional work in Hume's essay, I argue that Hume believed a miracle was an event that falsified a law of nature. If so, this presents the theist with a challenge because the theist cannot maintain that there are miracles, that miracles falsify laws, and that laws of nature are true. So, the theist must either modify the definition of 'miracle', the definition of 'law of nature', or become a deist. Finally, I consider other events that are beyond the norm, but do not falsify any laws of nature---e.g., a cloud that forms the words ""Made by God"" though each water molecule's spatiotemporal location can be accounted for by some law of nature. This event would not satisfy the Humean definition of a miracle, but it is still an event some may attribute to God. So, I outline an original account of a new category of events---what I call Special Divine Actions---which are all the actions that are not apart of God's creation or sustaining of the physical universe. Such Special Divine Actions likely include all the (Humean) miraculous events, but also events that are non-miraculous.",,,

141,Modulation-Doped SrTiO3/SrTi1-xZrxO3 Heterostructures,"Two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in SrTiO3 have attracted considerable attention for exhibiting a variety of interesting physical phenomena, such as superconductivity and magnetism. So far, most of the literature has focused on interfaces between nonpolar SrTiO3 and polar perovskite oxides (e.g. LaAlO3 or rare-earth titanates), where high carrier density 2DEGs (_3 x 1014 cm-2) are generated by polar discontinuity. Modulation doping is an alternative approach to generating a 2DEG that has been explored extensively in III-V semiconductors but has not heretofore been explored in complex oxides. This approach involves interfacing an undoped semiconductor with a doped semiconductor whose conduction band edge lies at a higher energy, which results in electrons diffusing into the undoped semiconductor transport channel, where scattering from ionized dopants is minimized. Realizing a high-mobility modulation-doped structure with a SrTiO3 transport channel therefore requires both the optimization of the transport channel by minimizing native defects as well as the development of a perovskite oxide which has a suitable band offset with SrTiO3 and can be electron-doped. The growth of high electron mobility SrTiO3 as a suitable transport channel material was previously demonstrated using the hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) approach, where Sr is delivered via a solid source and Ti is delivered using a metal-organic precursor, titanium (IV) tetra-isopropoxide (TTIP). Expanding on this, in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) is used to track the surface and resulting film cation stoichiometry of homoepitaxial SrTiO3 (001) thin films grown by hybrid MBE. It is shown that films with lattice parameters identical to bulk single-crystal substrates within the detection limit of high-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements exhibit an evolution in surface reconstruction with increasing TTIP beam-equivalent pressure. The change in the observed surface reconstruction from (1x1) to (2x1) to c(4x4) is correlated with a change from mixed SrO/TiO2 to pure TiO2 surface termination. It is argued that optimal cation stoichiometry is achieved for growth conditions within the XRD-defined growth window that result in a c(4x4) surface lattice. The development of a doped perovskite oxide semiconductor with a suitable conduction band offset is then discussed as the next necessary step towards realizing modulation-doped heterostructures. The SrTixZr1-x O3 solid solution is investigated for this purpose, with a focus on optimizing cation stoichiometry to allow for controlled doping. In particular, the hybrid MBE growth of SrTixZr1-xO3 thin films is explored using a metal-organic precursor for Zr, zirconium tert-butoxide (ZTB). The successful generation of 2DEGs by modulation doping of SrTiO3 is then demonstrated in SrTiO3/La:SrTi0.95Zr0.05O 3 heterostructures, and the electronic structure is studied by Shubnikov-de Haas analysis using multiple-subband models.",,,
142,"Ableist microaggressions scale: Development, validation, and relationship with social support","Participants in Study 1 or 2 who indicated that they identified as a sexual minority (e.g., bisexual, gay, lesbian, pansexual, queer, questioning, same-sex/gender attracted) were provided the option to participate in Study 3. Study 3 (n = 192) used the AMS to explore the impact of microaggressions on social support for sexual minorities with disabilities. Results indicated no relationship between reported microaggressions from specific communities and perceived social support within those communities. Additional findings, implications, and limitations are discussed within the context of the research literature. Research has demonstrated that overt and covert experiences of prejudice and discrimination have been associated with increased stress and distress among people with disabilities (Emerson, 2010; Mazur, 2008), a population with higher than expected rates of mental health concerns. Microaggressions are brief, commonplace verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities that intentionally or unintentionally communicate negative slights or insults toward particular social groups (Pierce, Carew, Pierce-Gonzalez, & Willis, 1978), and contribute to minority stress. Keller and Galgay (2010) outlined a useful taxonomy of microaggressions against people with disabilities, but no scale yet exists to measure experiences of microaggressions among people with disabilities. Three studies were conducted to develop, validate, and use a scale measuring microaggressions experienced by people with physical disabilities, the Ableist Microaggressions Scale (AMS). The AMS-initial version (AMSi) was developed through a literature review, feedback from three experts, two cognitive interviews, and a small pilot study. The final version of the AMSi included 32 items related to lifetime experiences with ableist microaggressions on a six-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 0 (Never) to 5 (Very frequently). Participants with physical disabilities (n = 1,392) were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk to participate in an online study assessing demographics, microaggressions, perceived stress, depression, socially desirable responding, creativity, and social support. Using exploratory factor analysis in Study 1 (n = 559), a 20-item, four-factor model emerged, including Helplessness, Minimization, Denial of Personhood, and Otherization. In Study 2 (n = 833), confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the factor structure determined in Study 1, and demonstrated adequate validity and reliability for the AMS.",,,
143,Laica o Libre : The 1958 university reforms and the fight over the identity of the Argentine nation,"My dissertation studies the conflict that preceded the creation of the first professional degree-conferring private universities in Argentina. This conflict, commonly referred to as the laica o libre conflict, took place between 1955 and 1958 and pitted supporters of a national university system monopolized by traditional ""laic"" or state-run universities against those who promoted a ""free"" educational system that allowed private Catholic universities to confer professional diplomas. I contend that the mass demonstrations, violent street confrontations, and clandestine political negotiations that characterized the laica o libre conflict permanently resolved one of the most divisive issues Argentines had faced since the mid-nineteenth century, the role of the Catholic Church in the nation's educational system. Using archival primary source material, periodicals, oral history interviews, and published accounts written by participants in the conflict, I explore four phases: the formation of a united front, the rupture of that front, a rethinking of the national project, and the final confrontation that concluded with the authorization of private universities. I employ two major methodological strategies: (1) I use individuals, including Jose Luis Romero, Atilio Dell'Oro Maini, and the brothers Arturo and Risieri Frondizi as avatars to explain the broader movements that selected them as their representatives; and (2) I look at the language, ideology and confrontational tactics used by political actors as they struggle to define the mission of Argentine universities. This methodology allows me to explain why the Argentine Catholic Church, which had failed to obtain its goal during the government of the military junta (1955--1958), was able to do so during the government of the military's constitutionally elected successor, Arturo Frondizi (1958--1962).",,,
144,Organic Semiconducting Molecules in Green Solvents,"Conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) contain a conjugated backbone and pendant groups with ionic functionalities. This unique structure combines the properties of semiconducting and water solubility. COEs have similar optical and electronic properties as compare to conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs), which have been widely studied for their unique combination of semiconductivity and water solubility, COE are relatively easier to be synthesized and purified. Certain COEs, such as DSBN+ and DSSN+, have been shown to spontaneously insert into liposomes and within the membranes of yeast, and to incorporate into the membranes of Escherichia coli leads to improvement of the current generation in MFCs. In order to study whether the structure variation would affect the biocompatibility of COEs and thus affect the performance of related devices, several new COEs in series with various conjugation length, molecular length, substitution groups with different electron withdrawing/donating group have been designed and synthesized. Organic photovoltaics (OPV) have garnered a large amount of attention due to their potential for making light-weighted, flexible and low-cost devices in large scale application However, despite the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSC have steadily increased through improvements in materials design, mechanistic insight and device architectures, less viii attention has been put on the sustainability of future application. The vast majority of high performing devices with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure are deposited out of chlorinated or aromatic solvents, such as chloroform and chlorobenzene, which require harsh preparation, costly clean up procedure. These solvents are quite toxic to environment and human being. Thus, to develop OSC system be processed out of alternative green solvents is of importance to the future application, especially in mass manufacturing. 2-MeTHF is used to process organic solar cell in the work. 2-MeTHF fits within the class of solvents sought from renewable resources and the concept of capitalizing on waste to generate useful chemicals. The power conversion efficiency of the solar cell processed out of 2-MeTHF is over 5%, which is quite decent and comparable to devices that processed out of chloroform. These findings open new opportunities for considering mass production of organic solar cells, and other optoelectronic devices. It also highlights that substantial molecular design may not be fundamentally necessary for opening environmentally benign processing.",,,
145,Blood-Cell Inspired Polymeric Drug Delivery Systems,"Polymeric carriers are a promising drug delivery system that are poised to treat numerous diseases, provided their abilities to control drug release and target specific parts of the body are successfully translated. The main issues preventing successful translation of polymeric carriers into the clinic includes poor vascular circulation, limited targeting and the inability to negotiate many biological barriers. Furthermore, multifunctional carriers capable of combining these functions have yet to be demonstrated. However, it is theoretically possible to design such multifunctional carriers as circulatory cells are capable of performing these same functions. During my Ph.D, I have developed three distinct blood-cell inspired drug delivery systems that improve the in vivo delivery abilities of polymeric carriers by utilizing and mimicking many of the abilities of the main individual cellular components in blood, namely: (i) erythrocytes, (ii) leukocytes and (iii) thrombocytes. The first two examples utilize a strategy known as ""cellular hitchhiking"", which involves the attachment of polymeric particles to the surface of circulatory cells so as to transfer innate circulatory and targeting abilities from cell to particle. The second strategy involves the design and application of synthetic platelets, dubbed platelet like nanoparticles (PLNs), which incorporate the essential biophysical (shape and flexibility) and biochemical (surface biology) parameters of natural platelets into a polymeric nanoparticle.",,,
146,"I Feel Confident Most of the Time : A Study of the Relationships Between Writing Transfer, Dispositions Toward Learning and Writing, and Perceptions of Classroom Contexts","This dissertation uncovers the self-perceptions of seven individual learners in relation to writing transfer as they move across the high school to college transition and encounter particular contexts for writing. Findings from this project suggest that the discovery and evaluation of one's prior knowledge includes dispositional elements, including self-efficacy and self-regulation. Meanwhile, dispositions and prior knowledge are also elicited in specific ways within the contexts in which transfer is expected to occur. Interview data revealed how participants applied their dispositions as agents of their own learning as they moved into new post-secondary learning and writing contexts. Furthermore, it revealed how participants' dispositions transferred across the high school to college transition and the specific contexts within them, and how dispositions informed participants' transfer of prior knowledge and/or application of new knowledge. Specifically, the movement (or lack of movement) across the transfer ""steps"" of detect and elect for participants suggests that the process of transfer involves more than the single act of moving knowledge across contexts. In taking a broader view of transfer through a D-E-C-Enculturation perspective, this study reveals how transfer is highly bound up with dispositions, particularly self-efficacy, and how dispositions interact with a detection of prior knowledge and a decision-making election of whether or not to transfer and/or transform prior knowledge in the new context. Self-efficacy and other dispositions particularly impacted how such decision-making took place for subjects in this study. Finally, this project views dispositions through a conceptual model of transfer that looks not only at what prior knowledge students connect to new writing tasks and contexts, but also to how they detect and elect to pursue their connections to prior knowledge and how they are enculturated into academic communities. Thus, in pursuing research on the relationship between dispositions and transfer, I have attempted to locate where learning dispositions factor in the student's experiences and perspectives of transfer using Perkins and Salomon's (2012) detect-elect-connect framework for learning transfer, to which I have added the fourth step of enculturation. As recently as 2012, Elizabeth Wardle called for writing studies researchers to give ""attention to the dispositions that students are embodying across fields and consider how the nature of those dispositions can either inhibit or enhance their ability to engage in the expansive learning and repurposing that I understand to constitute `transfer' of writing related knowledge"" (p. 11). In responding to this call in the research, this dissertation project applies a dispositional lens to writing transfer as it occurs in specific contexts for learning. While theories concerning the connection between writing transfer and dispositions have been initially explored (Driscoll and Wells, 2012; Wardle, 2012), this connection has not yet been empirically and comprehensively examined. This project attempts such empirical and comprehensive examination of these connections through an analysis of data through a conceptual model which seeks to both capture and examine the relationships between dispositions, writing transfer, and contexts for learning. In order to begin to understand the relationships between transfer, dispositions, and learning contexts, the qualitative and empirical nature of this study presents findings that reveal the conceptual model in action from the actor's---or learner's--- perspective. As extensive research on dispositions leading up to this project has argued, dispositions are always elicited in particular contexts. But, as this research also shows, dispositions can work broadly as they are carried into and out of contexts by individuals. Contexts also embody particular conditions and dispositions of field to which individual dispositions attune. This concept of individuals' attunement to communities or contexts for learning reveal the shaping and constructing nature of context and how individual dispositions may be enacted in learning or writing transfer. Ultimately, findings from this project suggest that further research on the connections between dispositions, contexts, and a D-E-C-Enculturation view of transfer can help classroom practitioners, learning theorists, and composition researchers more deeply consider the roles that dispositions play in learning and writing transfer.",,,
147,Cultural Amenities and the Consumer City Hypothesis,"The results indicate that higher levels of cultural amenity-related employment are indeed associated with higher median home prices, providing support for the consumer-city hypothesis. Furthermore, levels of amenity-related employment at one point in time can be strong predictors of median home prices several years later, although they proved less useful for predicting the percentage change in median home values over time. Amenity-related employment may therefore be a potentially useful indicator to consider when predicting median home values. These findings also open up avenues for future research into the applicability of the consumer-city hypothesis in other First World countries as well as the developing world. The rise of the modern service- and information-based economy has accompanied an increased concern for quality of life compared to earlier eras. The consumer city hypothesis argues that in a post-industrial society, people increasingly value the location-specific amenities a particular city has to offer when deciding where to live. This is in contrast to traditional wisdom, which holds that jobs are the sole or most important criterion in attracting people to a given place. While other studies have found an association between natural amenities and greater demand for places that have them, there is much less work focusing on whether cultural amenities have the same effect. This analysis aims to discover whether there is additional evidence to support the consumer city hypothesis by investigating the relationship between cultural amenity levels (as measured by employment in amenity-related fields) and demand for particular places (as measured by median home prices). This study examines 357 Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States (including those in Alaska and Hawaii). Data from the American Community Survey and the Bureau of Labor Statistics were used to measure amenity-related employment, median home prices, and other demographic variables. Four linear regressions were run to determine the relationship between these variables in the years 2012 and 2005, as well as to discover the predictive value of amenity-related employment for future median home prices and changes in median home prices over time.",,,
148,"Robotic Sculpture Development through Appropriated Choreographic Strategies, Facilitating Artistic Exploration of Visual Perception, Object-ness, and Symbiosis between Physical and Virtual Media","The domain of dance enjoys a centuries-long history of exploring movement through choreography, and many valuable approaches and techniques have been codified within that discipline. Yet there has been no rigorous appropriation of those strategies from the domain of dance to the domain of sculptural practice, despite a rich history of successful appropriations of other kinds within and outside of artistic fields. This dissertation illustrates the appropriation of choreographic techniques from the domain of dance to the domain of kinetic sculpture through the use of robotic technologies and tools. It further explores of the affordances of that approach to the development of hybrid physical/virtual systems and to the exploration of visual perception. The research suggests that a formal system of choreographic development, with supporting tools and methodologies, allows the creative freedom to explore sculptural motion in an unencumbered process of experimentation and observation. The work suggests future research in the areas of: multi-sculptural systems; viewer-as-choreographic-participant; cybernetic dance/robotic systems; and systems of ""data kinetification"" and ""audio kinetification."" Through these explorations and avenues for further research, the work contributes to the growth of contemporary visual art practice. Choreographic manipulation is also shown to enable artistic exploration of visual perception and related philosophical concepts. Precedents in art history, particularly Op Art, are provided, in addition to background in cognitive psychology and philosophy which informs discussion of these cognitive and self-reflective explorations. A classification is presented for visual artwork which exploits low-level visual perception, illustrating where new work would fit into historical precedents, and revealing an uncharted gap in visual art which explores perceptual constructs through choreographed robotic sculpture. Examples are provided from the author's practice, which exploits the phenomenon of object permanence through the cybernetic interaction of physical and virtual media within a shared ecosystem. Choreographic manipulation is further shown to enable creation of ecosystems incorporating combinations of sculptural, digital and corporeal elements. These are positioned historically through new taxonomies which classify kinetic sculpture motion within cybernetic systems. The research draws upon a schema of 16 motif manipulations by Blom & Chaplin, as well as Laban effort actions, and techniques of chance and indeterminacy employed by Merce Cunningham. Software tools are presented which have been developed to enable these appropriations. The first, Gesture Creator, allows gestural input via body sensing and direct manipulation of a sculpture, and subsequent modification of gestures utilizing choreographic strategies. The second, Motif Developer, takes advantage of known compositional forms to enable development of sequences of gestures and motifs. The importance of gravity is discussed, both in terms of its place in choreographic history and its implementation through different forms of mechanical design. The effective use of the tools and methodology is illustrated through examples of robotic sculpture from the author's practice. Choreographed sculpture work is placed in historical context through a new taxonomy of complexity in kinetic sculpture systems. A review of literature is provided on motor cortex activity produced when observing dance and robotic systems. The review informs a new linear model of sensori-motor brain activation in art, illustrating that the present research enables creation of ""bio-kinematic sculpture,"" a sculptural form facilitating viewer brain activation.",,,
149,Understanding Nanoemulsion Formation and Developing a Procedure for Porous Material Growth using Assembled Nanoemulsions,"Nanoemulsions as an emerging technology have found many applications in consumer products, drug delivery, and even particle formation. However, knowledge gaps exist in how some of these emulsions are formed, specifically what pathways are traversed to reach the final state. Moreover, how these pathways affect the final properties of the nanoemulsions would affect the applications that these droplets possess. Some nanoemulsions possess unique properties, including the assembly of droplets. While the assembly of droplets is being studied in the Helgeson lab, work must be done to understand how the assembly itself could be used to control the growth of porous materials, such a hydrogels. Thus, this thesis aims to address two factors of nanoemulsions: the formation of water-in-oil nanoemulsions and the use of assemblying droplets in oil-in-water nanoemulsions to form macroporous hydrogels. To elucidate the formation mechanism of water-in-oil nanoemulsions, a combination of dynamic light scattering and small angle neutron scattering were used to study the intermediate and final states of the nanoemulsion during its formation. These nanoemulsions were prepared by slowly adding water to an oil and surfactant mixture and were diluted to effectively measure using scattering techniques without multiple scattering events. To develop a procedure to use assembled nanoemulsions for the growth of porous materials, a combination of optical microscopy and diffusional studies were employed. Optical microscopy images taken at various stages of the procedure help elucidate how the pore sizes of the final porous material is related to the droplet-rich domains of the assembled nanoemulsion. Meanwhile, diffusional measurements help confirm the size and interconnectedness of the macropores. From the work done in the completion of my thesis, the formation mechanism of the water-in-oil nanoemulsion studied has been elucidated. The neutron scattering measurements show that during the formation of the nanoemulsion, a combination of droplets and vesicles form. The presence of vesicles provides insight into how chemical additives in the water would affect the final droplet properties. This insight can be used to design water-in-oil nanoemulsions to be used for the controlled synthesis of solid nanoparticles. Additionally, this work demonstrates a potential procedure for developing macroporous hydrogels using nanoemulsions that are assembled into droplet-rich and droplet-poor domains. Through mild UV cross-linking conditions and mild solvent extraction techniques, the pore sizes could be equivalent to the droplet-rich domain sizes. The final hydrogels can control diffusivity of molecules, giving them potential applications in drug delivery.",,,
150,"Antibody Aesthetics : Insecurity at the Intersection of Twentieth-Century Culture, Politics, and Science","This dissertation is an interdisciplinary examination of medicine, politics, and culture that explores how health and security became inextricably entangled throughout the long twentieth century. I also perform a disciplinary critique by resituating modernism and science fiction within a cultural history of biopolitics. I reconstruct an assemblage of secondary texts in medical, social, and political science driven by archival research in digitized medical journals, as well as at the Wellcome Library in London and the Wyndham Lewis Collection at Cornell. I read this archive through modernist and science fictions, tracing the emergence of a violent logic of self-defense that imbricates the discourses of health and security, naturalizing sociopolitical, racial, and national differences. I trace across cultural production common themes, figures, and anxieties associated with this entangling of health and security, a set of epistemologies which I call ""antibody aesthetics."" These antibody aesthetics revolve around liminal figures whose exclusion serves to define and delimit imagined communities. I historicize the development of these aesthetics in relation to biopolitical discourse and governance, examining them throughout novels such as Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway (1926), Ellison's Invisible Man (1952), and Coetzee's Life and Times of Michael K. (1983), popular films such as the Halperin brothers' White Zombie (1932), and science fiction novels including Richard Matheson's I am Legend (1954) and Max Brooks' World War Z (2006). Methodologically, I draw upon interdisciplinary work in the Medical Humanities, Science and Technology Studies (STS), and related fields. The project analyzes scientific journals, works in social science and social theory, cultural criticism and theory, and cultural productions. I make three interventions in this project. I recontextualize modernist and science fictions, demonstrating their shared development of antibody aesthetics, and noting structural, thematic, and discursive similarities as a result. I offer a new genealogy of biopolitics that contextualizes the term's emergence in 1911 in relation to the use of biomedicine in governance, and the increasing use of political metaphor in biomedical conceptualizations. Finally, I demonstrate how contemporary preoccupations with bioinsecurity and terror, exemplified in the popularity of the zombie in culture, have their roots in medical, political, and cultural developments beginning in the 1880s.",,,
151,Growth and Carrier Transport Studies of III-Nitride Alloys by Ammonia Molecular Beam Epitaxy,"The III-Nitride alloys span the entire visible spectrum and offer applications to LEDs, lasers, solar cells and power electronics. A detailed understanding of heterojunction growth is required for achieving high performance devices especially due to the large lattice mismatch in this alloy system. The wurtzite crystal system also lacks an inversion center which provides a polarization-induced electric field along the c direction that can be exploited in device design or reduced by growth on other substrate orientations. We present results on the growth of InGaN films by Ammonia MBE on polar gallium nitride substrates as well as on nonpolar and semipolar orientations. We show results from coloaded growth conditions and investigate the effect of substrate temperature, growth rate, and ammonia flow on indium incorporation and impurity uptake. We then present solar cell results from a high indium uptake semipolar orientation with fields in a favorable direction for a p-i-n device. We also investigate and understand the effect of relaxation via basal plane slip and unintentional impurity incorporation on device performance. Results are then be presented on electron transport through c plane InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (MQW) active regions grown by NH3 MBE which have direct relevance to transport in MQW solar cells and LEDs. The presence of indium fluctuations in InGaN has been suspected and debated in the literature for some time, but there is still much that is not well understood. We present Atom Probe Tomography (APT) analysis of the quantum wells to explicitly examine the magnitude and length scale of these observed local alloy fluctuations. The discrepancy in current-voltage behavior between experiment and modeling using traditional 1D simulation software will be discussed. A 2D/3D drift-diffusion Schrodinger-Poisson solver developed by collaborators was used to input alloy fluctuation parameters to elucidate their direct effect on barrier heights and on transport behavior in these devices.",,,
152,Redox reactions of Silica-Supported Catalysts and their Molecular Analogs,"First, we report a bis(8-hydroxyquinolinato)(2-propanato)oxovanadium(V) catalyst, V(O)(HQ)2(OiPr), that selectively oxidizes alcohols under mild reaction conditions (60 , air) and operates via an unusual base-assisted mechanism. A silica-supported analog, V(O)(HQ)2(OiPr) x-A380, was prepared via a multi-step grafting procedure and tested for catalytic aerobic oxidation under similar conditions as the homogeneous system. The activity of V(O)(HQ)2(OiPr)x-A380 was much lower than that of V(O)(HQ)2(OiPr), suggesting that the two are not precisely structurally equivalent. Further analysis reveals that during the grafting procedure, unexpected oxidation of the ligand tether occurred, giving rise to a V(IV) product. In this work, three silica-supported complexes were prepared. Each was characterized in detail at each step of the attachment procedure, to verify the reaction and its completeness. The corresponding homogeneous catalysts were also prepared in order to make structural and reactivity comparisons. In a separate study, we prepared two silylpropyl bis(pentafluorophenyl)boranes as molecular models for the Lewis acid component of supported frustrated Lewis pairs. The borane precursors were thoroughly characterized using NMR to confirm their structures, and to provide reference signals for silica-supported analogs. Three types of supported propyl bis(pentafluorophenyl)boranes, were prepared using a two-step methodology. First, allyl propylsilanes were installed, followed by hydroboration using Piers' borane to give tethered Lewis acid sites. As for molecular FLPs, combination with a Lewis base could lead to applications as heterogeneous metal-free catalysts for organic synthesis. We describe approaches for the design and synthesis of silica-supported molecular catalysts, using ligand anchoring techniques to create site-isolated, discrete catalyst. Lastly, two periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMO) were synthesized by co-condensing either phenylpyridyl (ppy) silane or bipyridyl (bpy) silane, into the silica framework. The two materials were metalated using Cp*Ir(OH2) 3(OTf)2 to give Cp*Ir-ppy-PMO and Cp*Ir-bpy-PMO, respectively, as supported analogs for the molecular catalysts Cp*Ir(ppy)(OTf) and Cp*Ir(bpy)(OTf)2. When tested in the catalytic oxidation of propionaldehye using water as the oxygen source (aldehyde-water shift catalysis, AWS), the activities of the supported catalysts were comparable to those of the molecular systems, although all had the activities that are rather low. In spite of the low activity seen for AWS catalysis, Cp*Ir-ppy-PMO proved competent in the hydrogenation of levulinc acid. Redox-active silica-supported catalysts can be used to create alternatives to stoichiometric (i.e., non-catalytic) processes that are widely used in oxidation reactions and often require toxic and/or environmentally-unfriendly reagants. Catalytically active metal sites can be introduced to a solid support either as part of the framework of porous materials during their synthesis (co-condensation), or through post-synthetic attachment. The strategy of catalyst immobilization emphasized in this work involves linking a metal complex to a silica material via a grafted spacer or tether. This approach requires modifying one of the ligands of the catalyst precursor with a functional group or linker capable of creating the anchor, via a covalent bond, to the silica support. Much of the synthetic effort is devoted to preserving structure and reactivity of the molecular complex upon anchoring.",,,
153,"Phosphors for solid-state lighting : New systems, deeper understanding","We explore the structure-composition-property relationships in phosphor materials using a multitude of structural and optical characterization methods including high resolution synchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction and total scattering, low-temperature heat capacity, temperature- and time-resolved photoluminescence, and density functional theory calculations. We describe the development of several new phosphor compositions and provide an in-depth description of the structural and optical properties. We show structural origins of improved thermal performance of photoluminescence and methods for determining structural rigidity in phosphor hosts that may lead to improved luminescent properties. New white light generation strategies are also explored. A data-driven discovery of energy materials then reveals the efficient BaM2Si3O10:Eu2+ (M = Sc, Lu) phosphors with UV-to-blue and UV-to-blue-green phosphors. Interestingly, substituting Eu2+ in the Lu3+ containing material produces two emission peaks, at low temperature, as allowed by two substitution sites. The photoluminescence of the Sc3+ compound is robust at high temperature, while the Lu-analogue has a large decrease of its room temperature intensity. The decrease in emission intensity is explained as stemming from charge transfer quenching due to the short distances separating the luminescent centers on the Lu3+ substitution site. We then conduct an in-depth analysis of the average and local structure, Debye temperature, and structural rigidity in oxide phosphor host materials. The average and local structure of the oxides Ba2SiO4, BaAl2O4, SrAl2O4, and Y2 SiO5 are examined in order to evaluate crystal rigidity. Simultaneous momentum-space refinements of synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering yield accurate average crystal structures, with reliable atomic displacement parameters. The Debye temperature thetaD is extracted from the experimental atomic displacement parameters and compared with predictions from density functional theory calculations and experimental low-temperature heat capacity measurements. The role of static disorder on the measured displacement parameters, and the resulting Debye temperatures, are also analyzed using pair distribution function analysis of total neutron scattering, as refined over varying distance ranges of the pair distribution function. The interplay between optimal bonding in the structure, structural rigidity, and correlated motion in these structures is examined, and the different contributions are delineated. Next, we identify two new phosphor solid-solution systems, (Ba1- xSrx)9 Sc2Si6O24:Ce3+,Li+ and Ba9(Y1-ySc y)2Si6O24:Ce3+. The substitution of Sr for Ba in (Ba1-xSrx ) 9Sc2Si6O24:Ce 3+,Li + results in a decrease of the alkaline earth-oxygen bond distances at all three crystallographic sites, leading to changes in optical properties. The room temperature photoluminescent measurements show the structure has three excitation peaks corresponding to Ce3+ occupying the three independent alkaline earth sites. The emission of (Ba 1- xSrx) 9Sc2Si 6O24:Ce3+; Li + is red-shifted from the near-UV to blue with compositional changes. The red-shifted photoluminescent quantum yield also increases when Sr is substituted for Ba in these compounds. The end member Ba9Y2Si 6O24:Ce 3+ was identified as an efficient blue-green phosphor with high thermal stability of the luminescence, viable for near-UV LED excitation. An efficient emission, with a quantum yield of &ap;60%, covers a broad portion of the visible spectrum leading to the observed blue-green color. The emission of this compound can be red-shifted via the solid-solution Ba9(Y 1-ySc y) 2Si6O24:Ce3+. We begin by presenting the development of a green-yellow emitting oxyfluoride solid-solution phosphor Sr2Ba(AlO4F)1- x(SiO5)x:Ce3+. An examination of the host lattice, and the local structure around the Ce3+ activator ions points to how chemical substitutions play a crucial role in tuning the optical properties of the phosphor. The emission wavelength can be tuned from green to yellow by tuning the composition, x. Photoluminescent quantum yield is determined to be 70+/-5% for some of the examples in the series with excellent thermal properties. Phosphor-converted LED devices are fabricated using an InGaN LED and are shown to exhibit high color rendering white light. Finally, new light generation strategies including quantum dots and laser-based lighting are explored. (Abstract shortened by UMI.). Next, the consequences of optimal bond valence on structural rigidity are explored and linked to the improved luminescence properties in Sr xBa2-xSiO 4:Eu2+ orthosilicate phosphors. We observe that in the intermediate compositions, the two cation sites in the crystal structure are optimally bonded as determined from bond valence sum calculations. Optimal bonding results in a more rigid crystal. Greater rigidity, in turn, results in high luminescence efficiency for intermediate compositions at elevated temperatures. We then explore the structure-composition relationships and optical properties in newly developed cerium-substituted (Sr,Ba)3(Y,La)(BO3) 3 borate phosphors. Examination of the coordination environment of the Ce3+ active site polyhedra coupled with low-temperature photoluminescence reveals three distinct excitation bands corresponding to Ce3+ located on three distinct crystallographic sites. Comparing the position of these excitation bands with crystal field splitting effects due to changes in polyhedral volumes and distortions suggests an assignment of the three excitation bands. These compounds are efficiently excited by UV light with blue emission, the most efficient compound determined to be Sr3La(BO 3)3:Ce3+,Na + with a quantum yield of 50%.",,,
154,Characterizing Structure and Properties of Woven Ceramic Matrix Composites,"Ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) with woven fibers are of interest for aerospace applications due to their low density, high strength and melting temperature, as well as broad flexibility in placement of fiber tows to match anticipated stress fields. Even when placed according to design, tows experience non-uniformities in stresses and strains due to their waviness. The added complexity of constructing complex weaves can further lead to undesirable variability in the weave structure. The present study seeks to extend the current understanding of structure-property relations in woven CMCs. It begins with the implementation of 3D digital image correlation (DIC) to characterize full-field strains and displacements with sub-tow spatial resolution. This enables the characterization of strain heterogeneities that develop in woven CMCs. 3D DIC is extended to characterize the variability in tow placement within 3D weaves. This variability exists at both short- and long-wavelengths. Short-wavelength variations are intrinsic to the weaving process and result in local variations in the packing density of the tows. Long-wavelength variations are attributed to shear deformation during handling after weaving. Discrete Fourier transforms of the intrinsic variations are used to provide a statistical representation of the weave structure. Using these statistics, along with the Monte Carlo method, virtual specimens are generated. Additionally, the study addresses the intermediate temperature embrittlement phenomenon endemic to SiC/SiC CMCs, in both water vapor and dry air environments. Oxidant ingress occurs through existing porosity and micro-cracks in the matrix, prior to the formation of stress-induced matrix damage. This process is sluggish, reducing the oxidant activity within the composite, resulting in preferential oxidation of the Si-based constituents prior to the BN fiber coating. These findings are in contrast to the current understanding in the literature. The effects of weave structure on surface strain evolution are investigated experimentally on a SiC/SiC CMC and through a meso-scale finite element model. Experimentally, strain elevations and failure initiation are observed on wavy segments of surface tows. Model predictions show similar features and indicate that strains are elevated in response to bending and straightening of the wavy tow segments. Tow straightening is accommodated by out-of-plane motion of the tows and can be suppressed to some extent by the underlying (sub-surface) plies. The constraint in the present material is low, because of porosity and micro-cracks present in the matrix-rich regions between the plies.",,,
155,Nonparametric Mixed-Effects Density Regression,"Conditional density provides the most informative summary of the relationship between independent and dependent variables. It enables us to examine the overall shapes of densities as well as summary characteristics such as quantiles and modes. Repeated measures designs are widely used in many areas such as agriculture, education and pharmaceutical sciences. The data from repeated measures designs are correlated. We develop a nonparametric method for conditional density estimation for repeated measures data. Specifically we propose nonparametric mixed-efffects density regression (NMDR) models. The NMDR models allow us to estimate conditional densities with fewer constraints on the form of densities when data are correlated. The models may be constructed using Smoothing Spline ANOVA (SS ANOVA) methods. Penalized marginal likelihood is used to estimate the density function as well as parameters. We use the stochastic approximation algorithm (SAA) with Newton-Raphson method for optimization, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for approximating integrals. An example from speech science is provided to illustrate the utility of our model.",,,
156,"Quantifying Speech Rhythms : Perception and Production Data in the Case of Spanish, Portuguese, and English","The second chapter evaluates a widely used metric of speech rhythms, the PVI, and determines that it is not effective in distinguishing between two dialects of Spanish. The third chapter compares the speech rhythms of Mexican and Chicano Spanish. This chapter concludes that Chicano Spanish is more restricted in its vowel duration variability, while Mexican Spanish employs both highly variable durations (i.e. stress-timed) and highly uniform durations (i.e. syllable-timed). The chapter describes a perception study used to compare the speech rhythms of Spanish, English, and Portuguese, and shows that these languages' rhythms do not always group according to language. In the fifth chapter, I describe a study of the production of the same utterances initially used in the perception experiment; this allows an analysis of what prompts the perceptual differences in speech rhythm described in Chapter Four. This dissertation addresses the methodology used in classifying speech rhythms in order to resolve a long-standing linguistic conundrum about whether languages differ rhythmically. There is a widespread perception, both among linguists and the general population, that some languages are stress-timed and others are syllable timed. Stress-timed languages are described as having less-regular rhythms, as syllable durations vary according to the placement of stress in the phrase. Meanwhile, syllable-timed languages are described as displaying less variation in rhythm, which syllable durations being more regular. This dissertation quantitatively evaluates these described rhythmic differences in Spanish, Portuguese, and English. The first chapter introduces speech rhythms and reviews past literature on their perception and production. The sixth and final chapter discusses the implications and applications of these findings and gives direction for further investigation. Although both production and perception studies of speech rhythms have been performed in the past, my dissertation expands these methodologies by combining production and perception data is a single analysis. I use perception data to relatively classify the rhythms of utterances through low-pass speech filtering, then analyze the production of these data computationally to provide a more complete perspective of what prompts differences in speech-rhythms and how Spanish, Portuguese, and English data relate rhythmically. Thus, my dissertation is thorough, while still addressing traditional rhythm metrics and employing current computational methodology. It seeks to challenge linguists' methodologies in quantitatively addressing speech rhythms, and to further clarify the position of Spanish, Portuguese, and English on the speech rhythm continuum.",,,
157,Design principles for oxide thermoelectric materials,"The work presented here outlines the development of design principles for oxide thermoelectric materials, which involved the creation of a thermoelectric materials database, identification of the property space of interest, and the experimental preparation and characterization of materials in this property space. This work also highlights the development of machine learning models to create a materials recommendation engine. This recommendation engine has discovered a new class of thermoelectric materials with unexpected chemistry, and is being used to suggest other new material compositions likely to exhibit promising thermoelectric performance. Over 60% of the energy in the United States is wasted, most of it as heat. This amounts to staggering losses of natural and economic resources, and although some of this heat is Carnot heat that is unavoidable, even recovering a small fraction of the remaining waste heat would lead to economic and environmental benefits. Thermoelectric materials are a class of materials that can generate power from heat, but their widespread deployment has been limited because thermoelectric materials are currently inefficient, made from rare elements, and decompose at high temperatures when operated in air. Researchers have sought to develop oxide thermoelectric materials to overcome these shortfalls, but development of oxide materials is still relatively new, and has lacked guiding principles that have led to significant advances in traditional thermoelectric materials.",,,
158,"Formal Determinants in the First and Fifth Movements of Hector Berlioz's ""Symphonie fantastique""","In this dissertation, I analyze the first and last movements of the Symphonie fantastique with respect to four layers: melody, harmony, orchestration, and hypermeter. I use several types of layer-interaction to determine points of large-scale structural significance and refer to this analysis to resolve points of disagreement over the form of each movement. Historically, this piece has been the subject of much criticism because Berlioz has mixed multiple styles, genres, and compositional procedures. Many of Berlioz's works have resisted both categorization and analysis thanks to this general creative strategy. Chapter One defines each of the four layers that I take into account and gives two examples of the ways in which these layers can move in and out of phase. Chapter Two compares three interpretations of Berlioz's first movement: as an ""arched"" sonata form in which the first and second themes are reversed in the recapitulation, as a Type 3 sonata form but with recapitulation beginning in the dominant, and as an instance of Anton Reicha's Grande coupe binaire. I suggest that the Grande coupe binaire and the Type 3 sonata forms each provide a closer model to the movement than the ""arched"" sonata hypothesis. Chapter Three compares my layered analysis of Berlioz's first movement and the first movement of Reicha's Symphony no. 2 in E_ I find similarities between the two movements that point towards Reicha's theory of the form as a plausible model for Berlioz's first movement. Chapter Four applies my proposed analytical technique to the entire fifth movement to establish not only the points of large-scale structural significance, but also to establish continuity in the movement by demonstrating momentum gain and loss through the interaction of the layers. Finally, Chapter Five evaluates Berlioz's Ronde du sabbat under the Paris Conservatoire's guidelines for the fugue by examining treatises by Reicha and by Luigi Cherubini. It then establishes the interaction of layers as an important aspect of fugue composition.",,,
159,Querying Large-scale Knowledge Graphs,"Another key problem in the context of graph querying is that this process needs to run under severe time constraints. The efficient search techniques are introduced from both the algorithm and the system aspects. In terms of the algorithm, we propose STAR, a framework for fast top-K searching for star queries. The technique is further extended to tackle general graph queries. From the system aspect, we investigate the distributed processing of large graphs in a cluster and propose the graph partitioning approaches. The technique is able to adapt in real time to changes in the query workload. In this thesis, we propose to tackle the challenges by primarily introducing a novel framework, Schemaless Graph Querying (SLQ), which supplies a flexible mechanism to querying large knowledge graphs. In essence, the query engine is built upon a set of transformation functions that automatically map keywords and linkages from a query to their matches in a graph. The end users are therefore not required to describe their queries precisely as that by most querying systems. To return the most relevant results in a fast way, SLQ also incorporates a learned ranking model that shall not rely on manually labeled data especially when the training data is difficult to obtain. This in turn give rise to the efficient top-K search techniques. In summary, my research is introduced based on the hypotheses that as the knowledge graph becomes more available, there is a great chance of serving user queries in a better way. My contributions devote to realize this vision mainly for the applications of graph querying. SLQ is designed inherently to better understand the user query intent. Rather than merely performing syntax based search, SLQ introduces the ontology base matching technique that can as well produce semantically related results. By leveraging an ontology index, an effective filtering mechanism is proposed to fast extract the top-K results based on the similarity quality. Moreover, a result summarization technique is invented to help the user inspect the excessive number of results: The users can enlarge and get detailed information on a summarized result view based on their search intents. With the rise of the Internet, social computing and numerous mobile applications have brought about a large amount of unstructured entity data, including places, events, and things. On one hand, the entity data, populated by a variety of data sources, is growing at an ever increasing speed. On the other hand, the service suppliers expect to render the entities pertinent to the things present in the information need of the users, rather than the data that merely matches the request strings. To meet these challenges, knowledge graph has been widely adopted in practice and become a fundamental building block for many commercial products from better recommendation systems to enhanced search engines. As the knowledge graph subsumes humongous valuable content, there is an emerging need for the querying techniques that can extract and deliver the information from the data to the users. However, querying the real-life knowledge graph is not a trivial task. It has to deal with complex, unstructured graph data that can't fit a specific data model. Although there are many research efforts that aim in this direction, they typically have not addressed the real challenges: (1) In contrast to the complex and tedious graph data, the query from the end users tends to be ambiguous and underspecified. (2) It requires the semantic query understanding since the rigid string matching is often not desirable. (3) The querying system must scale to large heterogeneous graph data. This suggests the techniques that combine effective ranking and searching strategies.",,,
160,Searching for Causality in AdS/CFT,"String theory with certain asymptotically AdS boundary conditions can be defined non-perturbatively using the AdS/CFT correspondence, which reformulates the theory in terms of a non-gravitational quantum field theory in a lower dimensional spacetime. In this way many of the subtleties of quantizing gravity are circumvented, however, the price of this simplification is that locality is no longer manifest, even in an approximate sense. In this dissertation we study features of asymptotically AdS spacetimes related to causality and search for these properties in the dual CFT description. We begin by reviewing some of the salient features of the correspondence and studying some puzzles related to the Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture. We then show that the notion of boundary causality associated with the Gao-Wald theorem implies that holographic CFT's on Minkowski space must satisfy the averaged null energy condition (ANEC). The ANEC is a quasilocal energy condition that requires the integrated null energy on a null line to be positive. Any violations of this condition in a holographic theory would result in ""causal shortcuts'' through the bulk spacetime which would allow propagation outside of the light cone in the CFT. We next study causal wedges associated with subregions of the boundary and argue that these regions of the bulk spacetime are associated with a particular coarse-graining of the CFT reduced density matrix. In particular, we conjecture that the area of the codimension-two boundary of these wedges is equal to a particular coarse-grained entropy which we name the 'one-point entropy.' We present several suggestive examples in which the conjecture holds as well as a proof that it holds to leading order in a class of spacetimes with a bulk first law. In an appendix we explain how the conjecture is equivalent to a statement about the classical Einstein equation which in principle could be rigorously proven or falsified.",,,
161,Thermoelectric Properties of Complex Oxide Heterostructures,"Thermoelectrics are a promising energy conversion technology for power generation and cooling systems. The thermal and electrical properties of the materials at the heart of thermoelectric devices dictate conversion efficiency and technological viability. Studying the fundamental properties of potentially new thermoelectric materials is of great importance for improving device performance and understanding the electronic structure of materials systems. In this dissertation, investigations on the thermoelectric properties of a prototypical complex oxide, SrTiO3, are discussed. Hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is used to synthesize La-doped SrTiO3 thin films, which exhibit high electron mobilities and large Seebeck coefficients resulting in large thermoelectric power factors at low temperatures. Large interfacial electron densities have been observed in SrTiO3/RTiO 3 (R=Gd,Sm) heterostructures. The thermoelectric properties of such heterostructures are investigated, including the use of a modulation doping approach to control interfacial electron densities. Low-temperature Seebeck coefficients of extreme electron-density SrTiO3 quantum wells are shown to provide insight into their electronic structure.",,,
162,"A contracorriente : la escritura y la muerte del autor en Mexico, 1968-1985. Miradas a la obra de Salvador Elizondo, Julieta Campos y Tomas Segovia","I focus on how Salvador Elizondo, Julieta Campos, and Tomas Segovia consider Literary Theory not just as an academic field, but also as the day-to-day writer's job. These three intellectuals were active writers during this period since they participated as translators, professors, and journal editors. As a result, their novels and creative essays were spaces where they extended theoretical reflections on literature. This dissertation counteracts the idea that Latin American intellectuals have not participated in the history of Literary Theory, which has been principally established by European intellectual's circles. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to lead scholarly attention to reassess the contributions of Mexican intellectuals to the Western history of ideas, and the role of Latin American intellectuals in the emergence of what we currently consider Literary Theory. This dissertation explores the period from 1968 to 1985, when there was an extensive production of Mexican novels and essays that show -albeit with unique characteristics- that Mexican intellectuals were engaged in active dialogue with French thought during the 1960s. Therefore I focus on the points of encounter and reception of ideas that were circulating in Paris at that time, and Mexican intellectuals' intervention of these topics, such as the polemic discussion about ""the death of the author"" and its consequences: the birth of the reader, the narrative construction that shows a mental process of the writer -which are core issues of the Western thought nowadays.",,,
163,Towards efficient implementation of neuromorphic systems with emerging device technologies,"Nowadays with unbounded expansion of digital world, powerful information processing systems governed by deep learning algorithms are becoming more and more popular. In this situation, usage of fast, powerful, intelligent and trainable deep learning methods seems critical and unavoidable. However, despite of their inherent structural and conceptual differences, all of these intelligent methods and systems share one common property i.e. having enormous number of trainable parameters. However, from a hardware point of view, the size of a practical computing system is always determined based on available resources. In this dissertation, we study these deep learning methods from a hardware point of view and investigate the possibility of their hardware implementation based on two new emerging technologies i.e. resistive switching and floating gate (flash) devices. For this purpose, memristive devices are fabricated with high density in crossbar structure to create a network which then trained with modified RPROB rule to successfully classify images. In addition, biologically plausible spike-timing dependent plasticity rule and its dependence to initial state is demonstrated experimentally on these nano-scale devices. Similar procedure is followed for the other technology, i.e. flash devices. We modified and fabricated the conventional design of digital flash memories which provide us with the ability of individual programming of floating-gate transistors. Having large-scale neural networks in mind, an efficient and high speed tuning method is developed based on acquired dynamic and static models which are then tested experimentally on commercial devices. We have also experimentally investigated the possibility of implementing vector-to-matrix multiplier using these devices which is the main building block of most deep learning methods. Finally, a multi-layer neural network is designed and fabricated using this technology to classify handwritten digits.",,,
164,The Protest News Framing Cycle : How News Attention and Framing Change over the Course of a Protest,"These results reveal the small window of opportunity protesters have to attract public support before news attention wanes and underscore the importance of protester tactics in shaping the narratives of coverage. Protesters have to strategically weigh the costs of confrontational tactics because such tactics can elicit more news attention to the protest, but these tactics might overshadow the core message of the protest itself. To identify the frame-changing dynamic occurring over time, I conducted a content analysis of the news coverage of Occupy Wall Street and the G20 protests in London, Pittsburgh and Toronto. The study identifies longitudinal changes in news frames about the substantive issues of a protest and the conflict that ensues between protesters and city officials during a protest. Findings suggest that conflict has a significant impact on the number of news stories about protests. Further, the results demonstrate how news framing opportunities change as a movement reaches different stages of the news attention cycle. The cases studied here illustrate that when the protests grew, journalists focused on the protesters' grievances, including economic inequality, bank bailouts, ending the Iraq War, and climate change. As the movements peaked, news attention shifted to the intensifying conflict between city officials and protesters. Ultimately, prolonged conflict is typically followed by a decline in protest news interest. When protests are successful, they force us to realize another world is possible. To be successful they have to communicate their message effectively and be persuasive. News coverage can often determine whether a protest will be successful or unsuccessful at amplifying its message and persuading audiences. This dissertation examines the relationship of news organizations and protest movements. It asks three primary research questions. First, how does news attention to a protest rise and fall over time? Second, do news organizations pay attention to the causes and grievances of protesters? Third, how does news framing of a protest change over time? To answer these questions, I develop a theoretical model, the protest news framing cycle, and present the results of a longitudinal analysis of news attention and framing of protest movements.",,,
165,A Monte Carlo Simulation Study Examining Statistical Power in Latent Transition Analysis,"Latent transition analysis (LTA) is a mixture modeling approach that is gaining popularity in social science, behavioral, and health research. LTA is a longitudinal method that can be used to investigate how individuals transition from one latent, or unobserved class, to another over time. Although LTA is gaining use in many disciplines, to date only two studies have examined the statistical power of this statistical approach. The present study aims to examine how sample size and model characteristics such as latent transition probabilities, model definition, item-response probabilities, and class size influence the statistical power of to detect effects in latent transition probabilities. Meta-analysis findings were used to guide conditions ultimately used in this Monte Carlo simulation study. All data were generated using Mplus (Muthen & Muthen, 1998-2014). Results from this study revealed how larger sample sizes, larger transition probabilities and class sizes were more likely to have greater power. Results also highlighted the importance of a well-defined measurement model with high class separation and homogeneous classes and its influence on statistical power. Findings from this dissertation provide evidence on which conditions tend to have higher or lower power. Additionally, findings show how poor conditions can have model convergence issues and provide misleading results due to ""artificially high"" power values. This study also includes practical recommendations and suggestions for future directions.",,,
166,Mathematical Approaches to Understanding Mammalian Circadian Rhythms,"Over evolutionary timescales, nearly all aspects of gene expression have been coupled to the day/night cycle. As a result, circadian rhythms are essential to maintaining metabolic homeostasis, DNA repair, cell cycling, and other important cellular processes. Since modern societies have deviated from their evolutionary prescribed sleep and feeding schedules, disturbances to circadian gene expression have grown more common. Beyond acute effects on performance and fatigue, compromised circadian rhythms have been linked to chronic issues such as the onset of metabolic disease or increased cancer risk. Since circadian rhythms can be damped by factors such as jet lag, shift work, and high fat diets, there has been recent interest in developing pharmacological or behavioral therapies which might restore normal circadian rhythms. Nearly all life on earth exists in a periodic environment, in which important factors like sunlight and temperature change predictably with a twenty-four hour cycle. As a process which only reacts to the current state of a periodic signal will constantly suffer a phase lag, organisms have developed a natural feedforward controller to predict upcoming environmental changes. Such a system allows an organism to align their behavior to the correct phase of the day/night cycle and ease transitions between times of energy abundance and energy scarcity. These daily changes in physiology are known as circadian rhythms and are coordinated by intricate genetic regulatory networks. This thesis uses techniques from dynamic systems to model circadian oscillations at different scales. First, a mathematical model of the core circadian feedback loop is developed in order to explain a novel small molecule modulator, KL001. Through this mathematical model, we gain new insight into how the two isoforms of cryptochrome (CRY1 and CRY2) interact to control the period. The identifiability of parameters and parametric sensitivities in oscillatory models is investigated next, and a dynamic optimization technique using collocation methods and nonlinear programming is shown to be able to efficiently bootstrap confidence intervals in such parameters. This technique is then applied to a set of three circadian models in order to identify mechanisms which are able to differentiate between the effect of two small molecule regulators, even across differences in parameter values and kinetic assumptions. Next, the effect of finite-duration perturbations on clock amplitude and synchrony is explored. New techniques and sensitivity analyses are developed which allow the effect of transient perturbations on the clock to be efficiently calculated without the need for computationally intensive stochastic simulations. Finally, the effect of clock perturbations on stochastic noise is investigated by fitting the damping rate of cultured cellular reporters. Using genome-wide siRNA knockdown screens, we are able to gain fundamental insight into design principles of circadian oscillations.",,,
167,Understanding and Controlling Light Alkane Reactivity on Metal Oxides : Optimization Through Doping,"Herein, strongly coupled theoretical calculations and experimental techniques are employed to design, synthesize, characterize, and catalytically analyze doped oxide catalysts for the optimization of light alkane conversion processes. Density Functional Theory calculations are used to predict different energies believed to be involved in the reaction mechanism. These parameters offer valuable suggestions on which dopants may perform with highest yield and activity and why. Synthesis is accomplished using a combination of wet chemical techniques, suited specifically for the preparation of doped (rather than supported or mixed) metal oxide catalysts of high surface area and high reactivity. Characterization is paramount in any doped-oxide investigation to determine if the catalyst under reaction conditions is truly doped or merely small clusters of supported catalyst. With that goal, diffraction, X-ray, electron microscopies, infrared spectroscopy, and chemical probes are used to determine the nanoscopic nature of the catalysts. Additional novel measurement techniques, such as transient oxidation reaction spectroscopy, determined the nature of the active site's oxidation state. Metal oxide catalysts have numerous industrial applications and have garnered research attention. Although oxides catalyze many important reactions, their yields to products are too low to be of economic value due to low conversion and/or low selectivity. For example, some oxides can catalyze the conversion of methane to intermediates or products that are liquefiable at yields no higher than 30%. With improved yield, such a process could help reduce the trillions of cubic feet of natural gas flared every year, saving billions of dollars and millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases. To this end, one goal of this work is to understand and improve the catalytic activity of oxides by substituting a small fraction of the cations of a ""host oxide"" with a different cation, a ""dopant."" This substitution disrupts chemical bonding at the surface of the host oxide, which can improve reactant and lattice oxygen activation where the reaction takes place. Another goal of this work is to combine catalysts with metal oxides reactants to improve thermodynamic limitations. Outstanding challenges for the study of doped metal oxide catalysts include (1) selection of dopants to ix synthesize within a host oxide and (2) understanding the nature of the surface of the doped oxide during reaction.",,,
168,Social visibility and identity signaling behaviors,"Social identity is valuable for studying social behavior because identical actions can have dramatically different meanings when viewed through the schemas and goals activated by membership in different social groups. The motivations to think positively about ourselves, our groups, and to cultivate warm social reactions drive us to behave in ways that demonstrate positive identities. Public behaviors are especially impactful on social status and self-perceptions, so the visibility of behaviors is a fundamental contextual feature that binds behavior more closely to identity. When public behaviors signal a desired social identity, individuals will be motivated to increase those behaviors relative to less visible actions. When public behaviors signal an unwanted social identity, individuals will decrease those behaviors relative to less visible actions. This claim is evaluated in the context of environmental identity and behavior in three United States surveys using ideographic sampling and multilevel modeling to incorporate variability in how behaviors are viewed (Chapter 2, N = 1,126), and three laboratory experiments manipulating visibility and objectively observing environmental behavior (Chapter 3, N = 735). Strong support was found in the correlational studies for the moderation of visibility on the relationship between identity and behavior, controlling for a wide range of confounds. The experiments successfully developed a convincing context where individual identity predicted environmental behavior, but were inconclusive for testing for moderation by visibility. Theoretical and methodological advances are described for both social psychology and environmental psychology, and future designs and suggestions for research are provided (Chapter 4).",,,
170,Reverse first principles : Weber's law and optimality in different senses,"The relationship between optimality and evolvability is analyzed through a case study of Weber's law, a common property of many sensory systems across a wide array of species. After demonstrating a variety of senses in which Weber's law is mathematically optimal, we ask whether principled methods exist for evaluating such optimality analyses. We argue that at least one such method exists: examining the evolvability of a trait with respect to each of the different metrics that it happens to optimize. Through evolvability analyses of Weber's law, it is demonstrated that optimality-equivalent measures of phenotypic quality need not be selectively equivalent: a trait that is optimal by two measures may have very different behavior under selection for each. This non-equivalence allows different optimality analyses of the same phenomenon to be assessed by a standard other than intuition, and in a manner requiring fewer degrees of freedom than are needed to model selection from scratch. Two qualitatively different models of selection are explored: phenotypic selection, a basic form in which mutations directly affect the model phenotype, and embryological selection, a more exotic form in which mutations affect the algorithm by which the phenotype is built.",,,
171,Microfluidic Cytometry Using Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Biotags,"Finally, a multiplexed SERS identification system was developed which enabled us to discriminate between four populations of microbeads that were labeled with multiple cocktails of four SBTs. This platforms can be used for various immunophenotyping application where cells with multiple surface biomarkers are targeted.  In In the second system the two-tag platform was used in order to identify circulating prostate cancer cells in a background of normal prostate cells. In this system, one SBT was used as a universal tag and the second SBT was targeting a specific biomarker that is overexpressed in cancer cells. We managed to detect a population of 1% cancer cells in a mixture of cancer and normal cells.  In the first platform, the concept of identification of SERS-labeled particles in a microfluidic channel was put to test. As a proof-of-concept, micron-sized beads labeled with different combinations of two tags was used and successfully identified by means of ratiometric analysis of SERS signals. Here, we use a flow-focusing microfluidic device to transport cells and micron-sized particle to a SERS interrogation region and collect their signature in a cytometry fashion. Three labeling and data analysis schemes were developed: In this dissertation, we combine microfluidics and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) in order to create a platform for identification of cells labeled with SERS biotags (SBTs) based their multiple surface biomarkers. Microfluidic systems allow us to transport cells to the detection region and control their advection with unprecedented control and precision. It also help us with faster processes using smaller sample quantities. In combination with a powerful chemical detection method such as SERS, a platform capable of multiplexed identification of cells can be developed. SERS is a molecular identification method based on enhancement of molecules' vibrational spectra due to plasmonic resonances. Metallic nanostructures are needed to achieve unparalleled enhancements that render SERS capable of detection single molecules.",,,
173,Optimization Programming for Stormwater Control Measures : Methods for Sizing and Selection,"The contamination of urban runoff is the result of a number of natural and anthropogenic processes: changing and rapid expanding population and land use within urban areas; vulnerable receiving water bodies that become contaminated from degraded storm runoff that hinders their hydrologic, ecologic, and socioeconomic functions, and intense rainfall events with pronounced seasonal and inter-annual variability of storm intensity (typical in the western United States). State and federal regulations on Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) of pollutants to natural waters from urban storm runoff are not met by most cities in the USA. This thesis presents a modeling and experimental study using one of the best available data sets on urban land use, soils, groundwater, streets, storm conveyance infrastructure, non-point and point sources of pollution, rainfall, and Stormwater Control Measures (SCMs) technologies. The implementation of GIS-based electronic maps to classify areas according to their conditions: heavy traffic, impervious soils, high rainfall intensity for design storms, high urban density, and steep topography. The selected SCMs are tested in chosen priority catchments to assess model-predicted performance with field performance. The research task consists of field-experimenting with dry wells and vegetated swales. These types of SCMs appear to have good performance potential in permeable soils, and swales exhibits high aesthetic distinction and value. These SCMs are field tested to determine their pollutant removal efficiency for selected indicator pollutants (for example, total suspended solids). Two alternative optimization models for SCM siting and sizing are presented in this thesis:  Nonlinear Programming (NLP) for optimal sizing and selection of SCMs uses mixed (binary-real) nonlinear integer programming formulation. The Study Problem and Research Objectives. Fouling of water quality in receiving urban storm runoff is chronic in metropolitan areas across the USA and large cities worldwide. These urban areas have well-known problems of polluted storm runoff and urban flooding. Urban storm runoff exhibits deleterious physical-chemical-biological characteristics, such as bacteria, trash content, large biochemical-oxygen-demand (BOD), oil & grease, toxic sediments, water-borne pathogens, suspended solids (SS) and total dissolved solids (TDS), heavy metals, and nutrient content that degrade water quality of receiving waters. Intellectual Merit of the Research. This is a novel research attempt to develop and integrate novel analysis of pollution and suitability for SCM deployment with optimization programming method for the selection of the types and sizes of SCMs in urban catchments. This thesis proposes a novel approach to (1) model, screen and or evaluate urban areas using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with the purpose of selecting appropriate SCMs in watershed hot spots, (2) select suitable SCMs to be deployed for the capture of and treatment or retention of urban runoff using Optimization Programming, (3) implement and test the proposed research in a large urban area with pervasive urban runoff pollution, and (4) field test SCMs for which there is limited or no information on treatment efficiency to assess their runoff-cleaning potential. Optimization methods are developed and presented in this research work to minimize the total cost of SCM deployment while satisfying constraints on (i) the total cost of deployment, (ii) SCM capacities, (iii) volumetric balance at SCM sites, (iv) stormwater volumes at arbitrary sites, (v) unit Operational, Maintenance, and Replacement (OMR) cost, and (vi) water-quality and quantity at monitoring locations.  Linear Programming (LP) for optimal sizing of SCMs relies with a linear programming formulation. In addition, the Binary Linear Integer Programming (BLIP) for optimal selection of SCMs based on a binary (0,1) linear integer programming formulation.  Development and application of a SCM Optimization programing model to select from within the GIS-evaluated SCMs those that are most cost effective in reducing the pollutant loads and concentration in urban runoff;  Conducted field experiment to evaluate the pollution removal efficiency of percolation wells and vegetated swales.  Modeling and determination of priority catchments for SCM deployment based on SCM; Summary of the Research Method. The key tasks accomplished in this thesis are: Broad Impacts of the Proposed Research. This thesis overarching hypothesis is that the sequential application of (1) computer based modeling in screening of high priority urban catchments and cost effective SCMs, and (2) optimization programming, can be used successfully in (i) identifying catchments with high SCM indices to urban runoff pollution and (ii) selecting the most cost-effective SCMs to reduce runoff pollution. This novel research concept represents a trend setting approach in combating urban runoff pollution in the United States, and in other places where the resources and know-how for urban runoff pollution control are in high demand and required.",,,
174,A Very Modern Mystery : Investigating Community in Detective Fiction from Poe to Pynchon,"A Very Modern Mystery argues that detective fiction, emerging as it does from an awareness of how modernity brings community into question, provides a specific laboratory for recovering and redefining a sense of community in the modern world. It revolves around a figure that is undeniable modern, yet who struggles to think about making use of modern ideas and processes in a way that is mindful of the active interconnection that these might otherwise compromise. My reading of the genre's development across the last 150 years shows that its evolution from this original concern develops a way to move through the modern towards a rehabilitation of authentic community, rather than to participate in its ongoing erasure. My project begins with a re-presentation of mystery as a productive modern phenomenon, and then examines the evolving investigation of it from Poe to Pynchon, so as to present detective fiction as a way to think about being both modern and communal for the first time. This is an important contribution to the study of detective fiction, as it evolves the counter-Enlightenment reading of the genre (as appears in John Irwin or Michael Saler) in a way that acknowledges detection's departure from mere problem solving, but still insists on its practical effects in the world. It also presents the process of investigation---whether as a literary or historical experience---as a way to insist upon and maintain the active sense of community that is essential to modern life, and the practical basis for its just and meaningful elaboration. This enters into an important aspect of contemporary debates on community theory, which struggle with how to retain a political dimension, beyond abstract ethical concerns, as when Jodi Dean criticizes Judith Butler's writing about community as an ethics lacking a politics, or Janell Watson's suggestion that Roberto Esposito's formulation risks validating Neoliberal models of governance. In both cases, to read the detective at work in the world becomes an ongoing model for recognizing authentic community as the basis of the shared world, and acting in a way that not only affirms it, but seeks to develop that affirmation as the basis for new beginnings. Detective fiction is widely acknowledged as a quintessentially modern genre, and for a variety of reasons. The form enacts a rational scientific approach to problems, arises through modern models of production and circulation, and is ubiquitous in the modern world, as the most prolifically produced and consumed genre of last 150 years. However, it is also explicitly modern in another, deeper way, as it responds to anxiety over a fundamental problem of modern life: the way modernization produces alienation, and in particular tends to dissolve community. This is the ironic connection between a set of processes that empowers individual agency and creativity, and brings individuals into ever greater connection, yet erases those individuals' capacity to make use of these gains collectively, or interact in a meaningful way.",,,
175,The Remaking of Inner City Johannesburg and the Right to the City: A Case Study of the Maboneng Precinct,"This study is the result of two months of fieldwork conducted in the Maboneng Precinct; interviews were conducted with Propertuity staff, including Jonathan Liebmann (CEO of Propertuity Development), Alice Cabaret, the firm's urban strategist, as well as inner city residents, businesses, and South African nongovernmental organizations. This study ultimately aims to expose the under-discussed, central aspects of the neighborhood's design that act to reinforce class divisions and contribute to the displacement and marginalization of low-income residents throughout Johannesburg. The Maboneng Precinct, a regenerating neighborhood on the eastern side of the central business district (CBD), is rapidly transforming the inner city into a home for the city's elite and well-to-do youth. The Maboneng Precinct has successfully branded itself as an inclusive and integrated alternative to the exclusive northern suburbs, thereby allowing the neighborhood to successfully distance itself from accusations of gentrifying the inner city and displacing low-income residents. But despite a well-developed narrative of inclusivity, Maboneng is actively engaged in gentrifying urban space: the neighborhood functions as a fortified enclave within the inner city, where it caters exclusively to middle- and upper-income people seeking to ""take back the city"" from the urban poor. These actions erode the rights of ordinary individuals to inhabit, appropriate, and move within urban space. Dreams of a fully integrated and equitable South Africa have not been realized in the twenty years since the fall of apartheid. Inequality, spatial segregation, and economic and social exclusion within the country now highlight the limitations of the new democratic government and the incompleteness of South Africa's formal racial desegregation. These forces are articulated across Johannesburg's urban landscape, where: (1) wealth is concentrated in the northern suburbs, (2) peripheral townships continue to suffer from inadequate access to housing, service provision, and a lack of economic opportunity, and (3) inner city Johannesburg is dominated by the competing forces of urban degeneration and gentrification; interest in regenerating and reclaiming the inner city for wealthy suburbanites has grown in the last fifteen years, and now threatens to displace the inner city's low-income population.",,,
176,"What is Queer About Teenage Pregnancy? Race, Temporality and (Un)Happiness in Milwaukee's Prevention Campaign 2006-2015","This project analyzes teenage pregnancy prevention media campaigns sponsored by Milwaukee, Wisconsin from 2006-2015. Constructing teenage pregnancy as a serious social problem, the Milwaukee campaigns use raced, classed, heteronormative, violent rhetoric to abject teenage mothers and instruct the public in how to feel about them and their offspring: disgusted and angry. I argue that teenage pregnancy prevention campaigns constitute a form of biopower, which influences all teenage women to construct their sexual subjectivity and behavior in relation to what I call ""the straight path"" and the ""path to happiness."" I demonstrate that teenage mothers are positioned as queer in their relation to power, through their engagement in sexual activity deemed unnatural, useless, and dangerous to society, and through their reproduction, which is decoupled from reproductive futurity and is positioned as (re)producing failed citizen subjects.",,,
177,(Re)Framing Raza: Language as a Lens for Examining Race and Skin Color Categories in the Dominican Republic,"This dissertation employs linguistics as a lens through which to analyze Dominican race and skin color descriptors. These terms, some uniquely Dominican in usage, index, or ideology, correspond to local, socially-constructed norms and parameters of identity, and have evolved in meaning over nearly six centuries. Through the analysis of archival documents, corpus data, surveys, and interviews in the Dominican Republic, the dissertation investigates the conceptual evolution of raza (&ap;'race') since the colonial period, engages popular understanding of what racial terms represent physically and socially, and explores the interaction between race and dominicanidad ('Dominicanness'). This project offers a mixed methods approach for the examination of race that first constructs meaning for each term (in lieu of translation), and then empirically tests hypotheses regarding physical and social information via photo description questionnaires. As the dissertation explores the rich information contained in the language of race, it argues that the contemporary Dominican concept of race may be subdivided into several distinct paradigms that researchers cannot take for granted; that informed analyses must account for regional differences within the Dominican Republic; that fluidity in the categorical boundaries of descriptive terms should not be mistaken for confusion; and that the physical boundaries of dominicanidad may be surprising. With language as the lens, this project offers new methodologies for investigating race and proposes new frames for interpreting the results that significantly contribute to ongoing conversations on race in the Dominican Republic, Latin America, and the Western hemisphere. The U.S. academy has a complicated relationship with the Dominican racial setting. Although scholars from diverse disciplines have examined race in the Dominican Republic for decades, the prevailing frame for analysis has been rooted in perceptions of exceptional negrophobia, xenophobia, and confusion, and essential denial of ""true"" racial identity. Even as new studies position race in the Dominican Republic in a more complex social and historical context, narratives of Dominican exceptionalism and essentialism persist in academic and popular discourse. The narratives criticize Dominican reticence to identify as negro and audacity to claim to be indio. Some have argued that the country is mulato, certainly not blanco, and only marginally mestizo. Despite the centrality of racial terms to this conversation, few studies have analyzed these terms as a critical intersection of language and race in the Dominican Republic. Nevertheless, as analysis increasingly crosses cultural and linguistic borders, language emerges as a vital paradigm for the study of race.",,,
178,Adaptations to Changes in Environmental Conditions and Policies,"Economic incentives for users of natural resources depend on both environmental conditions and policies in place to govern use of those resources. Similarly, polluting firms are financially impacted by the regulatory context in which they operate and the manner in which natural systems exposed to their pollution are affected. Shifts in environmental conditions or policy thus may alter the economic incentives and behavior of resource users and polluting firms. To the extent that such shifts impose higher costs, economic theory suggests that economic agents will seek ways to mitigate their exposure to such costs, either through preventative behavior or adaptation. As a result, the economic effects of change will depend upon the responses of affected individuals or firms. Here, I examine the effects of three types of change on the behavior of natural resource users and polluting firms. The first chapter employs dynamic game theory to examine the effect of a potential environmental regime shift on coalition formation in a shared fishery, finding that the threat of such shifts can support enhanced cooperation as a means to avoid the shift. The second chapter focuses attention on a policy shift in a multi-species fishery, studying how resource users respond to the introduction of tradable permits for bycatch species. That study uses a combination of theory and panel econometric approaches to identify multi-margin responses to the regulatory change, and in so doing, estimates the marginal costs of conservation for overfished species. In the final chapter, I continue to examine regulatory change, but shift systems to examine how environmental policy may stimulate innovation. In particular, I explore how tradable emissions permits can create incentives for unregulated firms to innovate, illustrating the consequences of such spillovers for policy analysis using both theory and an empirical application to the European Union Emissions Trading System.",,,
179,Influence of Phytoplankton and Extracellular Polymeric Substances on the Fate of Engineered Nanomaterials in Natural Aquatic Systems,"Evidences for direct interactions (physisorption and chemisorption) between algae/sEPS and ENMs, mediated by the various functional groups on proteins and nucleic acids or phospholipids were found. Adsorption of sEPS to ENMs changed the size and surface charge of the particles. In addition, the attachment efficiencies of ENMs decreased in the presence of sEPS due to electrosteric stabilization. Impacts of algae and sEPS were also found on ENMs' dissolution, transformation, and toxicity. This study demonstrated that the presence of phytoplankton and EPS in natural waters will have unique and important impact on the fate, transport, transformation, and effects of ENMs. In this doctoral research, sEPS were extracted from freshwater and marine phytoplankton (an important class of microorganisms) and their effects on the environmental fate of a variety of ENMs---including carbon nanotubes, copper and its oxides, iron, and titania nanomaterials---were studied. Interactions between algae, sEPS and ENMs were investigated via electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electrophoretic and dynamic light scattering, UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and infra-red spectroscopy. Effects of sEPS were investigated by studying changes in physicochemical properties, aggregation and sedimentation kinetics, and transformation of ENMs. The major components of sEPS were polysaccharides and proteins; and the ratio of both components varied with species and age of organism, as well as the nutrient composition of growth media. sEPS contained charged functional groups, such as carboxyl, phosphoryl, carbonyl, hydroxyl, amide, etc. Although the risks of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) to human and the environment are poorly understood, over 1800 consumer products currently on the market contain at least one ENM and the list continues to grow. The use of many of these consumer products will lead to direct release of ENMs into natural aquatic systems and several studies have demonstrated that ENMs can have adverse ecological effects. It is therefore important to understand the fate of ENMs in aquatic systems in order to predict and/or investigate their environmental implications. Microorganisms are abundant in natural waters into which they also release exudates such as soluble extracellular polymeric substance (sEPS). However, studies on how microorganisms and sEPS influence the fate and transformations of ENMs in natural waters are rare.",,,
180,Braid Groups and Euclidean Simplices,"In the early 2000s, Daan Krammer and Stephen Bigelow independently proved that braid groups are linear. They used the Lawrence-Krammer-Bigelow (LKB) representation for generic values of its variables q and t. The $t$ variable is related to the Garside structure of the braid group used in Krammer's algebraic proof. The q variable, associated with the dual Garside structure of the braid group, has received less attention. In this dissertation we give a geometric interpretation of the q portion of the LKB representation in terms of an action of the braid group on the space of non-degenerate euclidean simplices. In our interpretation, braid group elements act by systematically reshaping (and relabeling) euclidean simplices. The reshapings associated to the simple elements in the dual Garside structure of the braid group are of an especially elementary type that we call relabeling and rescaling.",,,
181,Interconnect Fabric Reconfigurability for Network on Chip,"The necessary modifications to build this hybrid system are area changes due to VeSFET additional layer, routing length changes, pipelining changes, and VeSFET technology parameter additions. The tools modifications necessary to include this system are described in further details in this thesis. The gathered data indicates great promise for the hybrid reconfigurable CMOS-VeSFET system over the conventional non-reconfigurable CMOS system. It is demonstrated that the hybrid VeSFET system has both a power decrease of approximately 57.0% and a performance increase of approximately 50.2%. To reduce this significant power consumption, various solutions were proposed targeting CMOS technology. In this work we focus on NoC topology improvements and reconfigurability using novel VeSFET technology. The work deploys tools used to simulate full systems, such as GPGPUSIM, to evaluate the possible performance/power gains of a hybrid CMOS-VeSFET system. This hybrid system includes CMOS core and memory layers, while the NoC layer is made up of VeSFET transistors. This allows for shorter wire lengths between routers and cores, as well as it permits for extra area to include network reconfigurability features. Microprocessor architectures are evolving at a pace greater than ever before. To meet the industry's stringent power, performance and cost demands there is a rising trend towards building heterogeneous processors with both CPU cores and off-chip components on the same chip. This is known as a System on Chip. These systems show promising solutions including chip interconnects consisting of Network on Chips (NoCs). These NoCs are composed of routers that control traffic, and channels used to connect different components of the chip itself together. Depending on the processor core's type, specifications, and technology used, the NoC fabrics may consume anywhere ranging from 28% to 40% of the total system power.",,,
182,Limits Under Conjugacy of the Diagonal Cartan Subgroup in SLn(R),"A conjugacy limit group is the limit of a sequence of conjugates of the positive diagonal Cartan subgroup, C _ SL3(R). In chapter 6, we prove a variant of a theorem of Haettel, and show that up to conjugacy in SL 3(R), the positive diagonal Cartan subgroup has 5 possible conjugacy limit groups. Each conjugacy limit group is determined by a nonstandard triangle. We give a criterion for a sequence of conjugates of C to converge to each of the 5 conjugacy limit groups. In chapter 8, we give a quadratic lower bound on the dimension of the space of conjugacy classes of subgroups of SLn n(R) that are limits under conjugacy of the positive diagonal subgroup. We give the first explicit examples of abelian (n -- 1)-dimensional subgroups of SLn( R) which are not such a limit, however all such abelian groups are limits of the positive diagonal group iff n _ 4. In chapter 4, we classify all subgroups of PGL 4(R) isomorphic to (R3,+), up to conjugacy, and Haettel shows each is a limit of the positive diagonal Cartan subgroup. By taking subgroups of these groups satisfying certain properties, we show there are 4 possible families of generalized cusps up to projective equivalence in dimension 3, and describe each cusp.",,,
183,Language Attitudes : The Role of Fluency,"Past research on the social evaluation of speech styles, or language attitudes, shows that, worldwide and cross-culturally, foreign- and other-nonstandard accented speakers tend to be rated less favorably on various traits (e.g., intelligence, friendliness), compared to their native- and standard-accented counterparts, respectively. Such findings have typically been explained with reference to categorization and stereotyping. Namely, listeners use language cues (e.g., accent) to make an inference about speakers' social group membership(s) and, in turn, attribute to them stereotypic traits associated with those (inferred) group memberships. This dissertation tested an additional (though not contradictory) explanatory mechanism for the language attitudes process, which predicts that more negative attitudes toward a particular accent can also be triggered simply by the difficulty associated with processing speech produced in that accent (i.e., disruptions in listeners' processing fluency). Three experiments were conducted to test this processing fluency hypothesis. In all three experiments, participants listened to an audio recording of a short story read in one of several accents (e.g., Standard American English, Punjabi English, Polish English). In the first two experiments, processing fluency was manipulated by varying the quality of listening conditions under which listeners heard the recording -- i.e., quiet or mixed with background white noise of various intensity levels. In the third experiment, processing fluency was manipulated by varying the strength of speakers' foreign accents -- i.e., mild or heavy. Overall, results of the three experiments revealed a remarkably similar pattern of results, largely consistent with the processing fluency hypothesis. In general, factors which disrupted listeners' processing fluency -- i.e., the presence of background white noise (Experiments 1 and 2), a stronger foreign accent (Experiment 3) -- also had a negative effect on listeners' language attitudes. Mediation analyses showed that the significant effects of noise (Experiments 1 and 2) and foreign accent strength (Experiment 3) on language attitudes were mediated by processing fluency and affect. Taken together, findings of the present research provide compelling evidence for an additional explanatory mechanism of the language attitudes by demonstrating that listeners' processing fluency can influence their language attitudes, independent of stereotypes.",,,
184,Sex Differences in Mental Rotation Tasks,"The Mental Rotations Test (Vandenberg & Kuse, 1978) consistently produces large sex differences favoring males (Voyer, Voyer, & Bryden, 1995). This test requires participants to select two of four answer choices that are rotations of a probe stimulus. Incorrect choices (i.e., foils) are either mirror reflections of the probe or structurally different. In contrast, in the original mental rotation task (Shepard & Metzler, 1971) participants judge whether two stimuli are the same but rotated or different by mirror reflection. It was hypothesized that the large sex difference in the Mental Rotations Test emerges as a result of males noticing and capitalizing on the orientation independent features of structurally different foils. Two experiments indicated greater accuracy and faster reaction times for structurally different compared to mirror trials for both sexes. A significant male advantage in accuracy was found for both trial types. Males and females did not differ in reaction time for either trial type. Although no evidence was found to suggest that differences in capitalizing on an orientation independent strategy accounts for the large sex difference, results suggest that the mental rotation process is not the only source of the sex difference in these tasks.",,,
185,Essays on Credit and the Labor Market,"The second essay, co-authored with Guillaume Rocheteau and Peter Rupert, studies the long-term, aggregate relationship between consumer credit and unemployment. The model is similar to that developed in Chapter 1, however, we depart from the assumption that households' borrowing constraints are driven by an enforcement technology and instead allow enforcement to arise endogenously based on lenders' ability to monitor household repayment. As a result borrowing limits are endogenous and depend on the sophistication of the financial system, the frequency of liquidity shocks, and the rate of return on (partially) liquid assets that households can accumulate for self insurance. Moreover, firms' expected productivity is endogenous and depends on firms' market power in the goods market and the availability of unsecured credit to consumers. As a result of the complementarity between credit and labor markets, multiple steady states might exist. Across steady states unemployment and debt limits are negatively correlated. We calibrate the model to the U.S. labor and credit markets and illustrate the effects of an expansion in unsecured debt similar to that seen in the U.S. from 1978 to 2008. Under the baseline calibration, the rise in unsecured credit can account for approximately three quarters of the decline in the long-term average unemployment rate. This dissertation consists of three essays on credit and the labor market. The first essays studies the aggregate, business cycle relationship between consumer credit and unemployment. Using micro-level data I show there is a consistent negative effect of unemployment on both a household's use of and access to consumer credit. I find that upon job loss, households increase applications for credit, get denied more frequently, and experience significant reductions in both debt outstanding and average monthly charges. I interpret these effects as an increase in credit constraints for the unemployed and examine how this relationship impacts macroeconomic variables over the business cycle. To do so, I extend the canonical Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) model of unemployment to include a goods market with search and financial frictions. Households have limited commitment in repaying debt and face borrowing constraints that are disciplined by the ability of lenders to enforce financial contracts. The model predicts that job loss is followed by a contraction in borrowing constraints. In the aggregate, this channel leads to a strategic complementarity between (un)employment and firm hiring incentives as a higher fraction of unemployed consumers decreases the expected revenue from a labor match. I calibrate the model to match the estimated fall in credit upon job loss and examine how these individual unemployment-related credit shocks affect aggregate business cycles. I examine the response of unemployment to aggregate productivity and financial shocks. I find that productivity shocks do a poor job of generating the co-movement of credit and unemployment we observe in the data. However, I find that aggregate financial shocks contribute significantly to the observed dynamics of both real and financial variables. The third essay, co-authored with Tai-Wei Hu and Guillaume Rocheteau, studies the set of equilibria in a pure credit economy with limited commitment and endogenous debt limits, similar to that studied in Chapter 2. We show that the set of equilibria derived under ""not-too-tight"" solvency constraints, as in Chapter 2, is of measure zero in the whole set of Perfect Bayesian Equilibria. There exist a continuum of endogenous credit cycles of any periodicity and a continuum of sunspot equilibria, irrespective of the assumed trading mechanism. Moreover, any equilibrium allocation of the corresponding monetary economy is an equilibrium allocation of the pure credit economy but the reverse is not true. On the normative side, we establish conditions under which constrained-efficient allocations cannot be implemented with ""not-too-tight"" solvency constraints.",,,
186,Towards Plasmonic Solar to Fuel Conversion,"The need to renewably store and utilize energy from chemical bonds has grown with recent economic and environmental concerns. Plasmonically-enabled devices have shown promise in various photosynthetic processes due to their scalable, cost-effective, and robust performance. Utilizing charge carriers derived from localized surface plasmons, these devices can drive various photoelectrochemical (PEC) reactions, however at limited efficiencies due to incomplete solar absorption. To improve broadband solar absorption in wide bandgap semiconductors, the plasmon resonance of different metal nanostructures in the visible are synthesized using anodic and sol-gel templating methods. Preliminary results suggest that gold nanoparticles and helical metal nanowires are well suited for photosensitization of titania for visible light absorption. Characterization by UV-Visible spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscopy, and photoelectrochemical measurements indicate that these templated methods can be utilized as the basis for synthesizing a variety of photoelectrochemical devices as well as unique plasmonic materials for applications including energy storage, sensing, and catalysis.",,,
188,Folk Taxonomy in Anishinaabemowin : A Linguistic Approach,"The theories of biological folk taxonomies have been discussed in the anthropological literature since the 1960's with several researchers such as Brent Berlin and Eugene Hunn devoting many articles and even books to the subject. Despite many examinations of the naming systems present in languages all over the Americas, there have been few, if any, works about the linguistic principles behind the two major theories of naming. This paper frames the linguistic bases for the two theories using data drawn from a corpus of Anishinaabemowin plant names and describes the linguistic basis for both Berlin's theory of a morphological (in the biological sense) basis for a hierarchical system of naming and Hunn's theory of use-based names. This paper will demonstrate that the theories of folk taxonomies can be greatly improved if theories of morphological (in the linguistic sense) preference are considered along with theories based in biological morphology or cultural usage.",,,
189,"Petrochronology of Ultrapotassic Intrusive Rocks and Associated Rare Earth Element-Bearing Carbonatite, Mountain Pass, California","The ages of the youngest ultrapotassic rocks overlap monazite Th-Pb ages from a carbonatite dike and the main carbonatite ore body (1396 +/- 16 and 1371 +/- 10 Ma, respectively). Epsilon Hf(i) values from zircon in seven ultrapotassic rocks yield consistent results both within and between samples, with a weighted mean of 1.9 +/- 0.2 (MSWD = 0.9), indicating derivation from a shared, isotopically homogeneous source. In contrast, exploratory in-situ Nd isotopic data from titanite in the ultrapotassic rocks are variable (epsilonNd (i) = -3.5 to -12), suggesting secondary alteration and/or contamination from an isotopically enriched source in some samples. The most primitive epsilonNd (i) isotopic signatures do, however, overlap epsilonNd(i) from monazite (epsilonNd(i) = -2.8 +/- 0.2) and bastnasite (epsilonNd(i) = -3.2 +/- 0.3) in the carbonatite, indicating derivation from a source with the same Nd isotopic signature. The petrogenesis of the rare earth element-bearing carbonatite at Mountain Pass, California remains poorly understood despite the deposit's discovery in the 1950s. Ore-bearing carbonatite dikes and a stock are spatially associated with a suite of ultrapotassic igneous rocks, and, based on geochemical data, the two have been proposed to be genetically related. Such petrologic models are complicated by existing geochronologic constraints indicating that the carbonatite is _15-25 m.y. younger than the ultrapotassic rocks, leading some authors to favor formation of the ore-bearing carbonatite during a separate, younger event and/or via a different mechanism. New laser ablation split-stream inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LASS-ICPMS) petrochronologic data from 19 ultrapotassic intrusive rocks from Mountain Pass yield titanite and zircon U-Pb ages from 1429 +/- 10 to 1385 +/- 18 Ma, expanding the U-Pb age range of ultrapotassic rocks in the complex by _20 m.y. Although carbonatite is the youngest rock type in the intrusive complex based on cross-cutting relationships, at the resolution of the LA-MC-ICPMS technique, Th-Pb monazite ages of carbonatite are not resolvable from titanite and zircon ages in ultrapotassic rocks, eliminating the previously inferred time gap between ultrapotassic and carbonatite magmatism at Mountain Pass. These new geochronologic data combined with whole rock elemental and mineral-scale isotope data imply that the ultrapotassic -- carbonatite rocks at Mountain Pass are part of a genetically-related suite that formed via extreme fractional crystallization and/or silicate-carbonatite liquid immiscibility processes.",,,
190,Controlling Passions : Emotional Expression in Thirteenth-Century German Sculpture,"Chapter 3 investigates the famous west choir and screen (ca. 1250) in Naumburg Cathedral. I argue that the facial expressions of the cathedral donors sculpted in the choir, who were members of the local nobility 200 years earlier, are best understood by focusing on their location: a cathedral choir that was the site of daily masses. The donor portraits respond emotionally to the mass and other liturgical performances associated with Christ's Passion. The appropriate emotional responses of the portrayed donors emphasize their authority to be the spiritual guardians of the cathedral and of the local elite to continue in this role, as well as modeling correct responses to the mass for the living to imitate. In chapter 1, I examine the Bamberg Last Judgment (ca. 1224-5), where smiles appear on the faces of both the blessed and the damned. The distinction between a virtuous and a sinful smile at Bamberg, as in contemporaneous artworks and texts, is one of context and degree. Appropriate smiles were a response to salvation, whereas inappropriate smiles revealed a lack of preparation for judgment. Early Christian and medieval writers emphasized that those who laugh during their earthly lives will know only tears at Christ's Second Coming. The reverse is also true: those who weep over their sinful nature and for Christ's sacrifice will be rewarded -- will smile -- on Judgment Day. The complex treatment of smiles on the Bamberg tympanum channels these discourses into a single scene, showing the virtuous smiles of the blessed and the sinful laughter of the damned side by side. Control of emotion was central to the medieval understanding of Christian salvation, and monumental sculptures were a key mode by which ecclesiastical patrons instructed the laity in correct emotional behavior. Each of this dissertation's three chapters focuses on the facial expressions and gestures of emotion in a single monument. I contextualize these expressions in relation to contemporaneous visual and textual materials. Theology, sermons, courtesy manuals, and Middle High German courtly literature offer textual perspectives on the complicated moral status of emotional behavior. Chapter 2 examines the contrast between violent anger and calm joy on a late thirteenth-century Stoning of St. Stephen currently in the Mainz cathedral museum. This sculptural ensemble holds important implications not only for the history of art and emotion, but also for the history of Christian-Jewish relations. The extant scholarship consistently holds that medieval representations of Jews encouraged stereotypes and promoted violence. Against this trend, I argue that the Stoning condemns violence perpetrated by Christians against Mainz's Jewish population in the 1280s by taking the irrational performance of anger as its central theme. The Jewish identity of these figures is here ambiguously marked. The sculpture therefore shifts blame for the violence away from the inherent evil of Jews and onto a failure to control emotion.",,,
191,Harvesting Geospatial Intelligence from Geotagged Social Media Data : A New Type of Early Warning System against North Korea,"This study is the first study about North Korea using geotagged social media data. It indicates that social media data has a rigorous potential and can be a new source for an EWS. This new approach method with social media data can be applied to other closed countries. After the Korean War in 1950, the Korean Peninsula was divided into North and South Korea. From that time on, a hostile stand-off has persisted for more than 60 years. After Kim Jong-un come to power, North Korea's provocations, such as the Yeon-Pyong Island bombardment and the attack of a Chen-an South Korean navy ship, reached a new level. North Korea is still threatening international societies by developing Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) such as nuclear weapons and Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. Moreover, as we saw from the 'Sony hack incident' where Sony Pictures Entertainment was hacked by North Korea in 2014 because of the film 'The Interview,' North Korea is now concentrating on cyber warfare. Thus, because of these incidents, the need for an advanced Early Warning System (EWS) against North Korea is increasing. For the tag analysis of Flickr and Twitter, all tags were counted and high-frequency tags were extracted and visualized with Word Cloud techniques. Lastly, various maps were generated using several visualization techniques. Second, 12,394 tweets from all over the world during the 'Sony hack incident' were analyzed for a case study. Study findings revealed that Twitter data provides a real time reflection of user's interest, event, place and time. Although North Koreans cannot use the Internet or social media applications, there were 11 tweets from North Korea and all of the locations for tweets were identified by Google Earth. By doing so, the potential flaws in using social media data, such as IP address hacking, were found. This thesis demonstrates the potential of social media data as a new source to collect Geo-spatial Intelligence (GeoINT) for an advanced EWS. In this thesis, structural analysis, based on geospatial data and content analysis utilizing images and text tags were conducted using two different datasets, Flickr and Twitter. First, a new approach for geotagged image processing was designed using the K-means and Spectral clustering algorithm using 3,981 North Korea Flickr images over a period of 11 years. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that image entropy is an effective input parameter for image characterization. We concluded that the Spectral clustering algorithm is suitable for selecting outlier images. In addition, Centrographic statistics were applied for the analysis of spatial and temporal dynamics. As a result, geotagged social media data revealed their user's behavior and interest by time and space.",,,
192,The Importance of Digital Skills in Understanding Online Political Behavior,"This research looks at the role of digital skills in political behavior in an online environment. It discusses what digital skills are and how they can be measured. Briefly, digital skills are the skills necessary to carryout various tasks and to participate in various activities on the internet. Additionally, this study compares digital skills to that of socioeconomic measures to differentiate them as a separate yet viable predictor of online political behavior. Both are included in a model of political activity to show how digital skills stand out as a predictor of online political activity. Further, this study estimates several additional models that show a consistent relationship with a variety of online political activities, including political activities associated with political donations, political discussions and time-based political acts. The goal of this analysis is to show a link between having higher levels of digital skills and an increase in online political engagement, as well as supporting an argument for the use of a digital skills measure in future studies of online political behavior.",,,
193,"Himalaya gneiss dome formation, focused radiogenic heating in southern Madagascar, and fertilization of the Neoproterozoic ocean by mantle-derived phosphorus","(II) Focused internal heating led to melting, metamorphism, and crustal weakening during the Neoproterozoic continent-continent collision between East and West Gondwana. Numerical models based on chronologic and thermal constraints across southern Madagascar indicate that radioactive decay of thorium was the principal heat source responsible for regional metamorphism at temperatures >900 C in the middle to lower crust. (I) Geochronology, thermochronology, and structural observations across Gianbul gneiss dome provide insight about the exhumation of middle crust in the India-Asia collision zone: Doming (1) initiated during the early stages of extension; (2) was driven by a positive feedback among dehydration melting, buoyancy, and decompression; and (3) culminated with the injection of anatectic melts into the upper levels of the dome. The dome was subsequently exhumed as part of a footwall block beneath a brittle normal fault. (III) The Neoproterozoic era was punctuated by profound tectonic, evolutionary, and environmental change. Biologic and climatic conditions may have been especially sensitive to fluxes of phosphorus (P) from the weathering of continental crust. Large igneous provinces-containing abundant P and highly susceptible to chemical weathering-occurred regularly during the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent. An estimated bioavailable P flux to the ocean from the weathering of basalt peaked at _720 Ma, immediately prior to rapid biologic diversification and the Sturtian glaciation; I postulate that the burial of organic carbon that resulted from this unprecedented P flux helped facilitate glaciation and triggered the oxidation of the ocean-atmosphere system.",,,
194,Schubert's Incorporation and Transcendence of Recitative in German Lieder,"This study finds that early songs with recitative can and should be performed observing the rhythm of speech over written note values when the accompaniment allows. However, increasingly after 1820, Schubert's Lieder became rhythmically more exact, requiring disciplined rhythmic execution with sparing rubato. This evolution is an example of Schubert's expansion and eventual distillation of Lieder into a dynamic but precise expressive medium, which established the Lied as a genre of worth for ""serious"" composers. This requires that Schubert's Liedrezitativ first be defined as an interpretive tool, including its dramatic and structural applications as well as its technical construction. In the opening chapter, specific Schubert Lied passages are compared with his compositional models and influences from opera, song, and the secular cantata. The second chapter explores Schubert's development and transcendence of Liedrezitativ, beginning with a brief explanation of Joakim Kramarz's work, Das Rezitativ im Liedschaffen des Schuberts. Kramarz uses an exhaustive analysis of Schubert's recitative cadential figures to demonstrate Schubert's evolution away from the techniques of Salieri and Gluck, but Kramarz's work remains largely musicological. The work at hand aims to expand Kramarz's findings, through analysis of Schubert's revisions to his own works and the construction of his late Liedrezitativ, and to discuss the implications of Schubert's evolution of style for modern performers. The third chapter explores the most effective and appropriate performance of Schubert's Lieder in consultation with treatises from the turn of the nineteenth century, first-hand accounts, Schubert's own words, the legacy of performance tradition embodied in today's leading Schubert performers, and the compositions themselves. This work traces Schubert's use of recitative in Lieder from its inception in his first song D5 Hagars Klage , through his eventual incorporation and transcendence of recitative. It discusses the implications of this evolution both in performance and the development of the German Lied..",,,
195,The Big Bang Singularity,"The big bang theory is a model of the universe which makes the striking prediction that the universe began a finite amount of time in the past at the so called ""Big Bang singularity."" We explore the physical and mathematical justification of this surprising result. After laying down the framework of the universe as a spacetime manifold, we combine physical observations with global symmetrical assumptions to deduce the FRW cosmological models which predict a big bang singularity. Next we prove a couple theorems due to Stephen Hawking which show that the big bang singularity exists even if one removes the global symmetrical assumptions. Lastly, we investigate the conditions one needs to impose on a spacetime if one wishes to avoid a singularity. The ideas and concepts used here to study spacetimes are similar to those used to study Riemannian manifolds, therefore we compare and contrast the two geometries throughout.",,,
196,Mechanism of toxin activity and delivery in bacterial contact-dependent competition systems,"In the introductory chapter, we will dissect what it known about each of these competition systems, including the toxin activities and delivery pathways of each system. Chapter 2 identifies a novel delivery process of a CDI toxin into Escherichia coli. In chapter 3 we will learn that the CDI system found in uropathogenic E. coli 536 is restricted to intrastrain delivery due to polymorphisms in the receptor proteins it utilizes for delivery. Chapter 4 will characterize novel CDI toxin activity while chapter 5 will explore the motive behind exploiting the metabolic enzyme, CysK, as a cofactor for a CDI toxin's activity. Finally, chapter 6 will describe the mechanism of toxin delivery in the T6SS found in the opportunistic human pathogen Enterobacter cloacae.. Ultimately, this thesis will explore the repertoire of toxins that are utilized by CDI and T6S systems. Chapters 3 and 5 will challenge the function of CDI as a competition system and suggests its role in kin selection. Lastly, we will examine the potential role of these competition systems in shaping microbial communities. Bacteria live in complex microbial communities and must face the constant challenge of limited space and resources. These harsh conditions have driven the evolution of a variety of competition and communications systems that allow bacteria to interact with the surrounding microbes and eukaryotic organisms found in their respective niches. The research presented here focuses on two such systems that Gram-negative bacteria use to deliver toxic effector molecules into neighboring bacteria. The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a dynamic syringe-like organelle that injects toxic effectors indiscriminately into both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In contrast, CDI systems are restricted to a narrow target range. CDI involves a two-partner secretion system that presents a large exoprotein, CdiA, to the surface of cells. CdiA binds to receptors on target bacteria to facilitate delivery of a toxin derived from its C-terminus.",,,
197,ASIC-enabled High Resolution Optical Time Domain Reflectometer,"Fiber optics has become the preferred technology in communication systems because of what it has to offer: high data transmission rates, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and lightweight, flexible cables. An optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) provides a convenient method of locating and diagnosing faults (e.g. break in a fiber) along a fiber that can obstruct crucial optical pathways. Both the ability to resolve the precise location of the fault and distinguish between two discrete, closely spaced faults are figures of merit. This thesis presents an implementation of a high resolution OTDR through the use of a compact and programmable ASIC (application specific integrated circuit). The integration of many essential OTDR functions on a single chip is advantageous over existing commercial instruments because it enables small, lightweight packaging, and offers low power and cost efficiency. Furthermore, its compactness presents the option of placing multiple ASICs in parallel, which can conceivably ease the characterization of densely populated fiber optic networks. The OTDR ASIC consists of a tunable clock, pattern generator, precise timer, electrical receiver, and signal sampling circuit. During OTDR operation, the chip generates narrow electrical pulse, which can then be converted to optical format when coupled with an external laser diode driver. The ASIC also works with an external photodetector to measure the timing and amplitude of optical reflections in a fiber. It has a 1 cm sampling resolution, which allows for a 2 cm spatial resolution. While this OTDR ASIC has been previously demonstrated for multimode fiber fault diagnostics, this thesis focuses on extending its functionality to single mode fiber. To validate this novel approach to OTDR, this thesis is divided into five chapters: (1) introduction, (2) implementation, (3), performance of ASIC-based OTDR, (4) exploration in optical pre-amplification with a semiconductor optical amplifier, and (5) conclusion. Thus, it begins by providing background, basic OTDR operation, overview of ASIC functionality, and past experiments done with the ASIC for multimode fiber. Chapter 2 begins the investigation of a high resolution OTDR for single mode fiber. A though explanation of how the OTDR ASIC operates is presented in this chapter, as well as details on the OTDR scheme that has been implemented. Chapter 3 analyzes the performance of the OTDR. Chapter 4 introduces a hybrid silicon semiconductor optical amplifier and discusses its theoretical implication on the OTDR in terms of improving receiver sensitivity. Lastly, a summary of the findings and discussion of other applications lie in Chapter 5.",,,
198,Understanding How Affirmations Shapes Individuals' Narratives Over Time and in Response to Chronic Naturalistic Threats,"Affirmations have been shown to have diverse and enduring effects. One mechanism that has recently been proposed to account for affirmation's long-term and disparate effects is affirmation's ability to shape individuals' narratives in response to threatening contexts. Across four studies, this dissertation seeks to probe deeper into understanding affirmation's effects and the role that changes in individuals' narratives play in leading to affirmation's outcomes. In Study 1, I investigate whether affirmations can reduce emotional reactivity in response to negative emotional events by changing the narratives that individuals tell themselves regarding their experience. In Study 2, I investigate whether individuals have a dispositional tendency to self-affirm in the face of life's everyday stressors and whether this tendency to self-affirm works via processes similar to those found in experimentally induced affirmations to produce similar positive outcomes. Further, Study 2 looks at how this tendency to self-affirm might change individuals' narratives regarding a uniquely stressful circumstance, the uncertainty of a military coup and ongoing political instability. In Study 3, I look at how experimentally induced affirmations change the stories individuals tell themselves about their experience of threat over time and in the context of chronic and existential threat---breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. Finally, in Study 4, I look at how an affirmation intervention might be combined with a novel narrative based stigma reduction technique to reduce HIV related stigma in the context of communities with high HIV rates and high HIV stigma in rural Lesotho, Africa.",,,
199,Cosmic Ray Dynamics in Galaxies and Galaxy Clusters,"Cosmic rays comprise a significant amount of energy in galaxy clusters, and are as energetically important in galaxies as the thermal gas. A careful treatment of cosmic ray transport is necessary to predict dynamics (such as CR driven winds) based on the radio observations which indicate their abundance. Yet the physics of cosmic ray transport are not very well understood. In this dissertation I will discuss how cosmic rays travel through and couple energetically with magnetized plasma, focusing specifically on the effects of streaming and heating in cluster and galactic environments.",,,
200,Aspects of Black Holes in Higher Dimensions,"This thesis is divided into three Parts. In Part I the general theory of black holes in higher dimensions is discussed. In addition to an introductory essay, two studies of linear perturbations of Myers-Perry black holes are presented. These black holes are the higher dimensional generalization of the Kerr black hole, and their analysis reveals numerous instabilities. Threshold unstable modes provide the connection between the Myers-Perry black holes and novel stationary black hole solutions such as black rings or black Saturns, as well as other non-stationary solutions known as single Killing vector field black holes. In Part II gauge/gravity duality is briefly reviewed and two aspects are studied in detail. First, the problem of finding a holographic dual to a superconductor with d-wave order parameter is investigated, and second, we examine the problem of holographic thermalization in field theories dual to rotating black holes. Lastly, in Part III the role of de Sitter solutions in string theory is discussed. A recent puzzle surrounding the fate of the de Sitter landscape is reviewed, and it is shown how the study of black holes in certain flux backgrounds can provide insight into this puzzle. We then present a theorem ruling out the addition of black holes to a certain class of flux backgrounds. Finally, a study is presented which shows that black holes can be added to the flux backgrounds relevant for the de Sitter landscape in string theory, thereby providing strong evidence for the resolution of the puzzle.",,,
201,Analyzing and Defending Against Evolving Web Threats,"The browser has evolved from a simple program that displays static web pages into a continuously-changing platform that is shaping the Internet as we know it today. The fierce competition among browser vendors has led to the introduction of a plethora of features in the past few years. At the same time, it remains the de facto way to access the Internet for billions of users. Because of such rapid evolution and wide popularity, the browser has attracted attackers, who pose new threats to unsuspecting Internet surfers. In this dissertation, I present my work on securing the browser against current and emerging threats. First, I discuss my work on honeyclients, which are tools that identify malicious pages that compromise the browser, and how one can evade such systems. Then, I describe a new system that I built, called Revolver, that automatically tracks the evolution of JavaScript and is capable of identifying evasive web-based malware by finding similarities in JavaScript samples with different classifications. Finally, I present Hulk, a system that automatically analyzes and classifies browser extensions.",,,
203,The Ties That Cross Lines : Transracial and Transnational Business Partnerships in the South African Township Bed and Breakfast Market,"More than twenty years after the dismantling of South Africa's white supremacist apartheid regime, racial inequalities remain entrenched in the South African landscape. Blacks are still largely excluded from white spaces and denied the resources and opportunities historically hoarded by whites. Despite their socially marginalized positions, Black South African women in the peri-urban townships have successfully established home-based bed and breakfasts for tourists in the post-apartheid era. In entering the global tourism market, some of these entrepreneurial Black women have developed social and economic relationships with white South African and European women. This thesis examines these transracial and transnational partnerships in the South African township bed and breakfast market. Drawing from field research and interviews conducted in Khayelitsha, a township outside of Cape Town, I demonstrate how these connections facilitate Black women's small business establishment and growth. Moreover, I argue that these unique relationships challenge the systemic processes that reproduce racial inequality, rendering township bed and breakfasts small but important sites where these processes are disrupted.",,,
204,Essays on worker value and contracts in team environments,"In many work environments, production occurs in teams. The value of that team's product, the productivities of workers' teammates, and workers' individual productivities help determine the value of workers to a firm, their wages, and the lengths of their contracts. This dissertation uses data from Major League Baseball to investigate these relationships. The first chapter estimates the relationship between team production and firm revenue and uses the estimated relationship to comment on the valuations of workers made previously in the literature. The second chapter analyzes wages and provides evidence that the young in the sample are willing to trade away wages to join more productive teams. The third and final chapter tests whether worker productivity uncertainty affects contract length and finds that length does increase with uncertainty. An abstract for each chapter is provided below. Chapter 1: This study finds evidence that the absence of firm fixed effects from regressions of Scully's (1974) firm revenue equation leads to overestimating a player's marginal revenue product by at least 164%. This result is consistent across two sets of seasons, is robust to two different measures of firm revenue and the most commonly controlled revenue sources, and occurs even in commonly used variations of Scully's (1974) revenue equation. This finding suggests that studies that have previously used the estimates of a baseball player's MRP or assume a conclusion drawn from such a study may need to be reexamined. Chapter 2: This study finds that an average free agent trades away wages to join a team expected to be more productive. More importantly, the young in the sample drive this result: an average, young free agent trades roughly 25% of his wages to join a team with an expected productivity one standard deviation higher. In contrast, the wages of older free agents are unaffected by expected team productivity. These results are robust to a variety of wage-determinant controls, remain consistent across a set of robustness checks, and suggest that better teams provide an important human capital investment opportunity. High-quality measures of both workers' own past productivity and the expected productivity of a worker's future team provide key advantages to identifying these effects. This study is the first to show that the expected productivity of the team a worker will join produces a significant and negative compensating wage differential and may offer an opportunity to invest in human capital. Chapter 3: This study finds evidence supporting worker productivity uncertainty as a contract-length determinant. This result is robust to a variety of worker- and firm-specific controls, is consistent across two different measures of uncertainty for two different types of worker productivity, and supports Danziger's (1988) efficient risk-sharing hypothesis. This study improves upon previous studies that analyze the relationship between real uncertainty and contract length by using worker- and firm-specific data for the first time. This key advantage allows this study to control, at the finest level, for contract-length determinants that could complicate analysis when using more aggregated data, a common problem acknowledged in the literature. Specifically, it allows Danziger's (1988) hypothesis to be tested with real uncertainty measures derived from the productivity history of individual workers. Finally, the sensitivity of a third measure of uncertainty provides an initial look into a promising area of future research.",,,
205,Reducing Prejudice with Labels : Shared group memberships attenuate implicit bias,"In three experiments, we used a novel Implicit Association Test procedure to investigate the impact of group memberships on implicit bias and implicit group boundaries. Results from Experiment 1 indicated that categorizing targets using a shared category reduced implicit bias by increasing the extent to which positivity is associated with Blacks. Results from Experiment 2 revealed that shared group membership, but not mere positivity of a group membership, was necessary to reduce implicit bias. Results from Experiment 3 showed that categorizing targets into shared group memberships expanded implicit group boundaries.",,,
206,Some Contributions to Nonparametric Bayesian Methods,"This thesis makes contributions to the area of nonparametric Bayesian methods and applications in two distinct subject areas. One is about classification problems in machine learning. The other is on network meta-analysis in the field of clinical trials. We start by introducing some basic facts about Dirichlet distributions and Dirichlet processes. Nonparametric Bayesian methods and models and their construction follows. We then provide a survey of the existing Markov chain Monte Carlo inference algorithms for Dirichlet Process Mixture models (DPMM), which is followed by a detailed description of these methods to the application problems. In the first application, we introduce the idea of incorporating wavelet transform and dimension reduction techniques with the probabilistic mixtures to perform complex classification tasks. These tasks involve distinguishing stages of retinal detachment process for confocal microscopic cross-sectional retinal layer images. In general, the progression of retinal detachment process is associated with different degrees of deformation of retinal layers and redistribution of molecules. Yet this leads to many challenges including lack of data in subcategories, inconsistent experimental conditions, huge intra-class variations, and different angles of target objects. We validate the excellent out-of-sample prediction performance of the model by repeated 10-fold cross-validation. In the second application, we develop novel DPMM-based hierarchical framework to model the uncertainty and heterogeneity of the historical trials into the non-inferiority (NI) trials. In NI trials, we compare the test treatment with an efficacious active control treatment when a direct comparison between test treatment and placebo is not available. Our goal is to demonstrate that the test treatment is not inferior to the active control by a pre-specified margin instead of directly showing the superiority of the test treatment over placebo. In the real clinical data examples, the model provides a more reliable estimate of the control given its effect in other trials in the network. It can further answer other questions of interest, such as comparative effectiveness of the test treatment among its comparators. More importantly, the model provides an opportunity for disproportionate randomization or the use of small sample sizes by allowing borrowing of information from a network of historical trials to draw explicit conclusions on non-inferiority.",,,
207,Emotional Ethics in Middle English Literature,"This dissertation explores Middle English literary texts that consistently portray ethics as a patently emotional affair. The introduction rehashes recent neuroscientific discourses that similarly assert the centrality of emotion in processes of ethical decision-making, as well as other contemporary theoretical and historiographic accounts of emotion. Chapter 1 argues that Middle English rhetorics of righteous and sinful anger played an important role both in sparking the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 and in retroactively reevaluating the dangers of uninhibited anger in the uprising's posttramatic wake. The second chapter discusses Middle English discourses on dread that suggest that devotees in late medieval England conceptualized the ascetic project of dreading well as integral to the ethical project of living well. The third chapter argues that the three successive versions of Piers Plowman, as we know them today, contain three strikingly different theologies of love and dread. Rather than reading these as evidence of one man's gradual movement from a theology of dread to one of love, it reimagines the production of Piers Plowman as a densely intersubjective affair that engendered a network of differing (and deferring) theologies of love and dread. Chapter 4 turns to the famous Middle English elegy Pearl, arguing that the Pearl-maiden does not prompt the dreamer to happily share in her celestial estate, but instead stirs his envy of her heavenly bliss, suggesting that terrestrial devotees ought to work through, rather than eschew, their envy of their celestial loved ones. Chapter 5 focuses on another poem solely attested in Cotton Nero A.x: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. While critics often read Gawain's shame at the end of the poem as sundering him from his fellow courtiers, I read Gawain's shameful confession to the court as profoundly and successfully reparative of the homosocial, chivalric habitus wounded by Gawain's life loving transgression. Moving next to Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, Chapter 6 builds on a scholarly tradition that reads Troilus as a masochistic courtly lover, arguing that, at the poem's conclusion, Troilus spontaneously transforms into a sadistic courtly hater. Since masochistic courtly love and sadistic courtly hate constitute different responses to social privilege, the courtly lover always already possesses the potential to morph suddenly into a courtly hater, as does Chaucer's Troilus when he channels his disappointment at having lost Criseyde's love into vengeful, militarized violence against any and all Greeks. Finally, by way of conclusion, I discuss some of the pedagogical implications of my research into Middle English ideologies of emotion, focusing particularly on the vexed question of how one might ethically teach medieval cultures of compassion.",,,
208,The 'Golden Age' of Women on Primetime Television? A Stereotype Content Model Approach to the Content Analysis of Media Figures,"To determine how portrayals of men and women differ on primetime television, a quantitative content analysis was conducted. A one-week composite of primetime television programming across nine broadcast and cable networks was randomly sampled, yielding 89 programs and 1,254 characters. This study uses the stereotype content model as a framework for the content analysis of media figures. Consistent with prior findings, women were significantly underrepresented on primetime TV when compared to men. Statistical analyses were run examining gender differences on variables related to warmth, competence, and traditional sex stereotypes. Overall, findings suggest that contrary to popular belief, the current state of primetime television does not represent a ""golden age"" for women. Though it appears some gender stereotypes have declined when compared to previous decades, others (e.g., dominant men, sexually provocative women) have persisted.",,,
209,Scalable automated evasive malware analysis,"The threat landscape of malicious applications, or malware, is persistently growing and evolving. Malware has become one of the major offensive components of the global cybersecurity threat. Accurate understanding of malware behavior is a crucial step towards developing systems that deter, detect, and defend against malware threats. Unfortunately, the widely deployed signature-based and lightweight static-analysis-based detection techniques (Antivirus) are easily evaded by techniques commonly seen in the wild, such as code obfuscation, packing, and encryption. Recent malware detection systems are moving towards a more robust dynamic analysis approach. These systems execute suspicious samples in a controlled environment, called ""sandbox"", and observe malicious intent through their dynamic behavior. However, many sophisticated evasive malware samples are evading such analysis by first detecting the analysis environment and then stopping their malicious activities. Because of the sophisticated and evolving techniques used by the malware authors, so far the analysis and detection of evasive malware has been largely a manual process. This manual approach is not scalable to tens of thousands of new malware samples that we observe every day. In this dissertation, I will present my research on scalable and automated evasive malware analysis. First, I will discuss my work on reducing the input load to a dynamic analyzer and present a static-filter called SIGMAL, which is based on image processing and machine learning algorithms. I will outline a bare metal-based approach to evasive malware analysis. Then, I will describe BAREBOX, a novel technique for improving the scalability of this approach. Next, I will propose a new algorithm for detecting deviation in the malware behaviors among different execution environments. The BARECLOUD project leverages this algorithm and builds a system for automatically detecting realworld evasive malware at a large-scale. Finally, I will present MALGENE, a first step towards the automatic extraction of evasion signatures from evasive malware samples. Given millions of incoming suspicious samples as a daily input, SIGMAL can quickly identify newer and relevant samples, BAREBOX can execute them transparently in a bare metal environment and generate behavior profiles, which BARECLOUD can use to automatically detect evasive samples. Given these evasive samples, MALGENE can automatically extract evasion signatures and cluster them according to the underlying evasion techniques.",,,
211,"Like Poison for Medicine : Understanding, Arbitrating, and Negotiating the Mark of Collective Dysfunction in Reality Television","Reality television has faced intense criticism for its negative depictions of African American women and their husbands engaging in personal and group disputes. ""Reality shows often cast relatively diverse groups with the intention of seeing whether conflict or harmony will result"" (Montemurro 2007:84). The tension between conflict and harmony provides dramatic tension that builds audience investment and engagement. It is a commonplace of reality television to portray families riddled with gendered and generational tensions and antagonisms. When the main characters in the show are Black, however, conflict and harmony take on an added resonance. The history that has given African Americans a linked fate makes harmony a survival strategy while rendering conflict as a threat to that survival. Moreover, the long history of imputing pathological dysfunction in Black families as the cause of Black suffering, a move that absolves white racism of responsibility, makes representations of Black family fights damaging to all Blacks in a way that does not apply to similar representations of white families. Presentations of dysfunction in Black families and social circles can be used to indict all Black people through the dynamic that sociologist Albert Memmi calls ""the mark of the plural,"" the process through which any failing by any member of a socially subordinated group is taken as evidence of the unfitness of the group as a whole (Memmi 2013:129). Yet Black families and social circles are not immune to the dysfunctions that appear in all social groups. The cumulative vulnerabilities created by generations of exploitation, oppression and cultural demonization impose intense pressures of Black sociality and solidarity. In this thesis, I argue that the same reality television portrayals that may well reinforce impressions of Black social pathology also provide Black viewers with a forum for understanding, arbitrating and negotiating the mark of collective dysfunction.",,,
212,Determining Phase Stability in the Co-Al-W System using First Principles Methods,"Co-based superalloys are a promising new material for high strength, high temperature applications due to their gamma-gamma' microstructure. Within the Co-Al-W ternary system, the gamma' phase manifests as an L1 2 structure in a small temperature range. Determining the thermodynamic stability of the L12 phase relative to other phases in this system is important for guiding the alloy development process. Density functional theory allows the direct calculation of free energy for these phases. The configurational energy component of the energy for the L12 structure was calculated via a cluster expansion, and the vibrational energy component for all structures was calculated in the quasiharmonic approximation. The results show that the L12 structures become stable at 600K and increase stability at higher temperatures, which has not been shown in previous work. The purpose of this thesis is both to show the encouraging research results in the Co-Al-W system, and also to be a useful guide for performing first principles calculations and connecting theory, VASP usage, and the utilization of the CASM code.",,,
213,Poincare inequalities under gauge transformations,"For connections on trivial vector bundles compatible with compact gauge groups, we establish conditions on the vector bundle and gauge group under which translation of a connection by a constant connection matrix is achievable by a gauge transformation. These conditions may be roughly characterized as either restricting the base manifold to be one-dimensional or restricting the gauge group to take values in an abelian Lie group. These results are then used to prove Poincare inequalities on the gauge equivalent connection matrices, with some additional refinement of these results when the data considered is compactly supported and Coulomb.",,,
215,Rio de Janeiro's Emerging Sporting Mega-Event Geography: Unraveling the Carioca Pattern of Urban Development,"In a span of two years the City of Rio de Janeiro will have hosted two of the biggest sporting events in the world, the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics. As I argue throughout this dissertation, the potential these sporting mega-events hold for attracting capital investment to the city is immense. And, as such, the City of Rio de Janeiro has unveiled a dizzying array of new urban policy initiatives designed to prepare the city for the mega-event and in the process make the city an attractive space for international investors. The consequences of these policies, I argue, is irrevocably altering the socio-spatial structure of the city creating new landscapes for tourist consumption and zones for real estate speculation. In the process, the City of Rio de Janeiro is permanently reconfiguring its nearly 450-year-old urban settlement pattern characterized by a relatively high-percentage of low-income residents occupying residencies in and near the urban core. This dissertation examines how this process is unfolding across the city. My findings suggest low-income residents are being pushed to the periphery of the city through both 'hard' displacement (forced evictions) as well as 'soft' forms of displacement, including gentrification. This research specifically focuses on the latter, exploring the various ways in which gentrified landscapes in Rio de Janeiro's sporting mega-event city have been produced. My research findings suggest a myriad of forces, including 'exceptional' urban policies, the commodification of Afro-Brazilian culture, and community 'pacifying police,' have been instrumental in producing gentrified landscapes in the city. Yet, by exploring gentrification in a number of spatial contexts over my five years of fieldwork, I suggest these processes unfold in a spatially uneven and place-contingent ways. I thus argue gentrification in Rio de Janeiro is actualized through a series of geographically unique connective processes, rather any one homogenizing force. This dissertation also examines how residents at risk of losing their homes resist gentrification and displacement. Through in-depth interviews with activists and months of participant observation, I point to the importance of place-based social movements asserting their 'right to stay put' through vigorous discursive and material defenses of their communities. These activists work to shift the production of locality in their favor so their communities might become viewed as a 'home' rather than an exploitable commodity.",,,
216,The Network Addressed: Digital Identity and Internet Infrastructure,"The Network Addressed tells the story of how the constituent logic of the internet became one of addressing. As early internet designers came to rely on the mathematical logic of identity as a design priority in constructing ARPANET and the internet, a problem emerged in deciding how to make these mathematically esoteric network entities legible to the general public. In what they perceived to be a pragmatic decision, designers labeled numbers according to the categories of the Domain Name System (DNS), as DNS categories were already part of the greater social and cultural infrastructure. This logic of addressing provided the foundation for our current system of global internet governance, embodied by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which manages the Internet Protocol address pool and the DNS according to a manufactured scarcity. Furthermore, this logic of addressing underlies the potential agency of digital ""whistleblowers"" and ""leakers"", as they model problems of subjectivity related to how early internet designers reified an ontology of numbers and names as they built the network of networks. The Network Addressed examines how this historically contingent logic of addressing clarifies global events that are shaping digital identity, which itself modulates the ontological contours of the internet as we know it.",,,
217,West Bank Public Transportation: Movement as Politics,"West Bank Public Transportation: Movement as Politics is a study of mobility via public transportation as an important object of social struggle and the social mobilization that can result from creative engagements with transit. In Palestine, public transportation has and continues to be used as a way for Israeli occupation forces to impose social control on Palestinians. At the same time, Palestinians use transit in both intentionally political and quotidian ways to build connections and community despite the occupation's efforts to fragment Palestinian society. Against a shattered topography of walls, tunnels, gates, and checkpoints, transit becomes the stage on which battles for territorial sovereignty, social cohesion, dignity, and human rights play out. While scholars have written about the structural impediments to Palestinian movement and the social fractures that result, they have not focused specifically on transit as a strategic instrument for state imposition of separation and grassroots efforts to connect. I contribute such a focus on public transportation as both my direct object of study--I examine its characteristics, structures, and usages as a system--and as a lens through which to better understand the changing economic, political, and racial nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Focusing on key episodes in the history of Palestine in which public transportation has played a significant role, I draw on critical theory, political sociology and social movements scholarship with international legal studies, cultural geography, and critical race theory. Based on ten months of mixed-methods fieldwork in Palestine, I present an analysis of the political dimensions of public transportation control and usage in the late Ottoman period (1892-1918), the British Mandate (1920-1948), the first Palestinian intifada (1987-1993), the Oslo years (1993-2000), the second Palestinian intifada (2000-2008), and the present-day West Bank. This socio-historical approach to the study highlights the value of transit for the imposition but also the bridging of geographic fragmentation in Palestine. An examination of mobility through the specific lens of transit reveals a uniquely nuanced picture of the strengths of state power as well as the limits imposed on it by popular mobility. My findings indicate that transit has been a useful tool in furthering various colonial and national aspirations over the last 120 years, enabling some and undermining others based on who exerts or subverts control over transit and how they do so. I relate my findings to international law to illustrate the importance of the universal human right to freedom of movement for the functioning of everyday life, how that right is routinely violated, and the ways in which people register explicit and implicit demands for that right to be restored. Finally, I argue that any productive resolution to the colonial affliction of Palestinian life must prioritize the unfettered mobility of Palestinians across Palestine.",,,
218,"Tectonic Significance of the Chambers Well Dike Swarm Whipple Mountains Metamorphic Core Complex, CA","A suite of Miocene dikes, collectively termed the Chambers Well dike swarm are exposed the southwestern footwall of the Whipple Detachment fault (WDF) and provide key insight into the evolution of the Whipple Mountains metamorphic core complex. New geologic mapping, U-Pb zircon geochronology, and whole-rock geochemistry allow for the assessment of: 1.) The ages, compositions, and volume of the dikes in the context of the local volcanic and extensional history 2.) The magnitude and timing of footwall rotation. 3.) The amount of slip on the southwestern WDF. The dikes intruded an approximately 40 km2 portion of the footwall of the WDF, comprised of an assemblage of Proterozoic gneisses and amphibolite bodies. Dikes can be broadly divided into two distinct groups; an andesite-rhyolite series (61-78 wt. % SiO2) ranging in age from 18.75 to 20.1 Ma, and a subordinate group of younger diabase dikes (55 wt. % SiO2). In the central portion of the dike swarm, dike-to-wall rock ratios range from 0.93 to 2.60 and imply ~100 to 250% WNW-ESE extension that was accommodated by intrusive dilation. Dike dips vary systematically from sub-vertical in the eastern portion of the swarm to gently east-dipping (~20-30) in the west, and take the form an inward-dipping fan. The combined field observations, geochronology, and geochemistry from the Chambers Well dikes and lava flows in the hanging wall of the WDF indicate that the western Whipple Mountains was a major Miocene eruptive center with local magmatic activity that began ~20 Ma. Early stages of extension (20.2 and 18.75 Ma) were dominated by intrusive dilation, but transitioned to large scale extensional faulting and tilting at 19.0-18.5 Ma, and may have been the result of thermal weakening of the crust. The asymmetric, fan-shaped geometry of the Chambers Well dike swarm can be explained by the combination of emplacement from an elongate, compositionally-zoned pluton at depth followed by ~40 of SW rotation about a horizontal axis, parallel to strike of upper plate strata (310). Restoring this rotation brings the mean dike orientations to sub-vertical, with strikes ranging from 310 to 002, and suggests an extension direction between 040 and 090. This interpretation also implies that the WDF initiated with a much steeper dip (~40-50), in agreement with classical Andersonian fault mechanics. Similarities in compositions and ages between the Chambers Well dikes and upper plate lava flows suggest that the dikes are the feeders to the thick volcanic sequence exposed in the western Whipple Mountains and Mopah Range. This correlation implies that there has been little-to-no NW-directed slip on the southwestern potion of the WDF since ~20 Ma.",,,
219,The non-contributive bystander: Extending the bystander effect to predict online information sharing,"The rise of online information pools---or information repositories comprised of individual's unique contributions---has sparked much research regarding individuals' motivations to share information in these contexts. However, the effect of non-contributors on individuals' motivation to share their own information has been understudied, in spite of the prevalence of non-contribution. Using the bystander effect as a theoretical lens, the present study explored the effect of others' contributive behavior on individuals' decision to share information on an online review site. In contrast to prior research, this study experimentally manipulated and measured the three psychological mechanisms underlying the bystander effect, allowing for a better understanding of the relationship among these mechanisms in the context of online information pools. A between-subjects 4 (bystander volume; 6, 49, 242, 831) x 2 (anonymity; anonymous, not anonymous) x 2 (contribution appropriateness; 4% contributing, 73% contributing) factorial design was used (N = 243). Although bystander volume is typically related to greater feelings of diffusion of responsibility, the present study found no significant between bystander volume and diffusion of responsibility; in fact, bystander volume was positively related to contribution amount, though this relationship was not linear. However, consistent with prior research, diffusion of responsibility was negatively related to contribution amount. Although prior research has found that individuals' behavior is influenced by the observed behavior of others, individuals' contribution amount and length in the current experiment was not affected by the social norms displayed in the information pool. Consistent with past research, individuals' feelings of anonymity were significantly, negatively related to evaluation apprehension, though neither anonymity nor evaluation apprehension was significantly related to contribution amount. Together, the findings of the present study suggest that the bystander effect and its underlying mechanisms operate differently in the context of an online review site than they do in face-to-face contexts or more traditional mediated contexts, such as email. Possible explanations for these differences and suggestions for future research are presented.",,,
220,"Aspects of emergent geometry, strings, and branes in gauge / gravity duality","We explore the emergence of locality and geometry in string theories from the perspective of gauge theories using gauge / gravity duality. First, we explicitly construct open strings stretched between giant gravitons in N=4 SYM. We find that these strings satisfy a relativistic dispersion relation up to three-loop order and conjecture that this should hold to all loop orders. We find the explicit dual solution to the string sigma model and find exact agreement with the geometric nature of the SYM operator and dispersion relation. Using these open strings as probes, we explore the local field theory on the worldvolume of the giant gravitons. Second, we use classical configurations in holographic matrix models to understand the emergence of geometry from matrix coordinates. We construct an effective Hamiltonian for a probe brane that observes the geometry in a background matrix configuration from which we can construct membranes embedded in three dimensional space. Adding angular momentum to these configurations we are able to observe continuous topology changes. We also study the classical evolution of holographic matrix models to generate a microcanonical ensemble of configurations and study their thermal and chaotic behavior. We argue that these thermal configurations are dual to black holes.",,,
221,Loss Mechanisms in Solution-Processed Small Molecule Bulk Heterojunction Solar Cells,"Amidst looming concerns over increasing carbon emissions and global climate change, solar cells made from solution processed small molecules have garnered considerable attention because of their potential to serve as an economically viable, low-carbon source of electricity. However, as with the other classes of organic materials, organic solar cells made from solution processed small molecules are not yet efficient enough to be commercially viable. The aim of this dissertation is to understand the loss mechanisms that limit the power conversion efficiency of these organic solar cells and to suggest strategies for improvement. Using a combination of electrical characterization techniques, it was found that two of the primary loss mechanisms in solar cells made from solution processed small molecules include field dependent generation and the recombination of free charge carriers. While field dependent generation is a significant loss mechanism in some cases, it was shown that it can also be completely overcome by careful control of the film morphology. The reduction of field dependent generation was found to be correlated with progressively purer and more ordered domains within the small molecule film. In contrast to field dependent generation, it was found that in all small molecule solar cells, there is some degree of free carrier recombination particularly at low fields close to open circuit. The nature of this recombination was found to be primarily bimolecular -- meaning a free hole recombining with a free electron (as opposed to a trap mediated process). While there is some variation in the rate coefficient of bimolecular recombination between systems, it was shown empirically that the charge carrier mobility is typically the most important determinant of the degree of voltage dependent recombination losses. For a 100 nm solar cell, both holes and electron mobilities should be at least 10-4 cm2/Vs in order to efficiently extract charge carriers before they recombine. In most material systems, it was found that the hole transporting molecule was the limiting factor in the charge transport of blend films and the hole mobility measured in neat films sets the upper limit for blend films. Further investigation revealed that increased order along the ?-? stacking direction in donor molecules is correlated with lower activation energy for hole transport however even if donor crystallization is achieved the transport in blend films may still be limited by the number of conductive pathways.",,,
222,"The Dynamic Interrelationships between Ethnicity and Agrobiodiversity in the Pearl Lagoon Basin, Atlantic Nicaragua","This dissertation characterizes the ways in which increased global connectedness differentially impacts agricultural decisions among the ethnically-diverse farming households in Atlantic Nicaragua's Pearl Lagoon Basin, with specific focus on farmers' maintenance of agrobiodiversity. Research conducted in other parts of the world has shown correlations between a farmer's ethnic identity and the agrobiodiversity they maintain within their farming systems. These trends remain even as small-scale farmers are connected to extra-local political and economic systems, which are cited as the drivers of global agrobiodiversity erosion. Yet, how ethnicity influences the maintenance of agrobiodiversity is poorly understood. Employing a political ecology framework that integrates ethnographic, demographic, survey, and agroecological methods, this research identifies that ethnically-distinct planting strategies exist among the Pearl Lagoon Basin's indigenous (Miskito), Afro-descendant (Creole and Garifuna), and mestizo farmers. Consistent with patterns identified by researchers elsewhere, farmers who identify with the area's indigenous and afro-descendant ""minority"" groups tend to maintain more diverse farms than nearby farmers who identify as mestizo, particularly those who are recent migrants to the region. In contrast to the findings of previous studies, however, the most connected farmers in the Basin tend to have the highest levels of agrobiodiversity within their farming systems. Qualitative and regression analyses reveal that ethnic patterns in the maintenance of agrobiodiversity are explained in part by the historical farming practices that characterize land use in the Basin and the agroecological knowledge that farmers develop over a lifetime farming in this socio-ecological context. Further, by acknowledging the plastic nature of ethnic identity, this research also highlights the importance of ethnic-based land rights in the Nicaragua's Atlantic Autonomous Region as a critical factor that both directly and indirectly influences the ethnic identities of farmers in the Pearl Lagoon Basin and their abilities to participate in agricultural development projects whose extension activities promote agrobiodiversity conservation.",,,
223,A New Method for Measuring Black Hole Masses in Active Galaxies: Modeling the Broad Line Region Using Reverberation Mapping Data,"Measuring the masses of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) allows us to trace their evolution over cosmic time and understand how black holes coevolve with their host galaxies. We present a new technique to measure black hole masses and constrain the structure of the broad line region in AGN using reverberation mapping data. We begin by developing a simply parameterized phenomenological model of the broad line region geometry and dynamics and apply this model to high-quality reverberation mapping data for six AGN from the Lick AGN Monitoring Project 2008 and 2011 datasets. The results of this analysis provide the most precise AGN black hole masses from reverberation mapping to date and the first detailed constraints on the geometry and dynamics of the broad line region emission. Specifically, we find that the shape of the broad line region is generally a close to face-on thick disk with preferential emission from the far side, and that the dynamics range from inflow to near-circular orbits. In addition, we present photometric AGN light curves using image subtraction for the Lick AGN Monitoring Project 2011 dataset as a first step towards modeling the broad line region in a larger sample of AGN.",,,
224,First-principles modeling of catalysts: novel algorithms and reaction mechanisms,"A molecular level understanding of a reaction mechanism and the computation of rates requires knowledge of the stable structures and the corresponding transition states that connect them. Temperature, pressure, and environment effects must be included to bridge the 'materials gap' so one can reasonably compare ab initio (first-principles, i.e., having no empirical parameters) predictions with experimental measurements. In this thesis, a few critical problems pertaining to ab initio modeling of catalytic systems are addressed; namely, 1) the issue of building representative models of isolated metal atoms grafted on amorphous supports, 2) modeling inorganic catalytic reactions in non-ideal solutions where the solvent participates in the reaction mechanism, and 3) bridging the materials gap using ab initio thermodynamics to predict the stability of supported nanoparticles under experimental reaction conditions. In Chapter I, a background on first-principles modeling of heterogeneous and homogenous catalysts is provided. Subsequently, to address the problem of modeling catalysis by isolated metal atoms on amorphous supports, we present in Chapter II a sequential-quadratic programming algorithm that systematically predicts the structure and reactivity of isolated active sites on insulating amorphous supports. Modeling solution phase reactions is also a considerable challenge for first-principles modeling, yet when done correctly it can yield critical kinetic and mechanistic insight that can guide experimental investigations. In Chapter III, we examine the formation of peroxorhenium complexes by activation of H2O2, which is key in selective oxidation reactions catalyzed by CH3ReO3 (methyltrioxorhenium, MTO). New experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to better understand the activation of H2O2 by MTO and to provide a strong experimental foundation for benchmarking computational studies involving MTO and its derivatives. It was found that water present in aqueous solvents plays a critical rate-enhancing role in accelerating the formation of the active sites. In Chapter IV we study olefin epoxidation catalyzed by MTO, and the strong accelerating effects in the presence of H2O. DFT calculations and experiments both support that the primary origin of the acceleration of catalytic epoxidation arises from the water-dependence of the rates of generation of the peroxorhenium complexes. Modeling catalyst surfaces and active sites under realistic conditions is also a long-standing computational challenge due to the dynamic nature of catalytic processes. For example, catalyst surfaces can restructure under reaction conditions, nanoparticles can undergo Ostwald ripening or even disintegrate into adatom-reactant complexes, and active-site poisoning from reaction intermediates or side-products could occur. In Chapter V we focus on understanding the stability of supported nanoparticles under reaction conditions against disintegration into adatom-reactant complexes, as reactant-induced disintegration can lead to catalyst deactivation or be exploited to redisperse sintered catalysts. More specifically, to better understand the stability of TiO2(110) supported three-way catalysts rhodium, palladium, and platinum nanoparticles during NOx and CO reduction, we conducted an ab initio thermodynamics study of the feasibility for these noble metal nanoparticles to disintegrate across a large parameter space of operation temperatures, pressures of CO or NO gas, and nanoparticle sizes. Lastly, in Chapter VI, the status of DFT modeling of catalysts is briefly summarized and some remaining challenges are discussed. (Abstract shortened by UMI.).",,,
225,Women in Department Store Work: New Forms of Labor Control and the Limits of Mobility,"Since the 1960's technological innovations and globalization have contributed to the declining numbers of manufacturing jobs. At the same time, the service sector has grown exponentially. This development has created a demand for more low-skill, low-wage jobs and fewer high-skill, high-paying jobs (Macdonald and Sirianni 1996). Retail workers comprise a key part of the growing service sector. Currently, retail work is the largest and one of the lowest-paid occupations in the U.S. My dissertation is an ethnography of a large, nationally renowned department store where I conducted 17 months of participant observation and 35 in-depth interviews with Latina and white female sales associates. My dissertation analyzes why women choose this job, how the department store deploys technology to develop new forms of labor control and how the retail workers/sales associates develop forms of resistance to craft a space to develop their social and cultural capital while juggling juggle work and family responsibilities. I find that the structure of sales work at the department store and the social interactions that emerge limit workers' objective forms of mobility, as defined by pay raises, promotions, and the ability to acquire skills that can be transferred to other jobs. Despite the low pay and limited opportunities for promotions, the majority of the workers perceive retail work at this department store as a form of subjective mobility they value such as working in a clean environment where a professional presentation of self is emphasized. A critical feature of this work is that a narrative of mobility is presented by the organization as possible although in reality, it is rarely achieved. This study broadens our understanding of processes of mobility and stratification in retail work that is service-oriented.",,,
226,Brain Invaders: Exploring the Impact of Platelet Transmigration on Serotonin Signaling in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex,"Recent evidence in immunology has indicated that a peripheral player may be contributing to central serotonergic signaling. Researchers have shown that transmigration of blood platelets across the blood brain barrier (BBB) occurs during times of inflammation in the CNS, but none have suggested whether or not this process impacts central serotonin signaling. This paper addresses current research determining the transmigration of platelets into the CNS under natural conditions and addresses future work to solidify any contribution by platelets to CNS 5-HT signaling. Using immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging we mapped the serotonergic varicosities of the mouse brain and used them in comparison to a swellshark (lacking a peripheral serotonin system) to determine any significant differences. It was observed that the 'loose-varicosities' seen in the mouse did not appear to be present in the sharks, indicating that these may actually be transmigrated platelets. In order to determine whether or not platelets that cross the BBB contribute significantly to 5-HT signaling we must first determine an accurate and efficient sensor to extracellular changes of 5-HT. In the presence of Fluoxetine (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor), RTq-PCR was used on a variety of receptors to determine sensitivity. Findings were inconclusive for all but one receptor (ITGB3), showing a significant increase in mRNA transcripts. Our results require further verification of platelets from the microvasculature in the CNS using more definitive labeling techniques, elucidation of additional markers as efficient serotonin sensors, and assessing changes in receptor expression as a function of pharmacological platelet depletion.",,,
227,The Caribbean and Global Capitalism,"As a new epoch in the history of world capitalism, global capitalism is shaping every region of the planet. One of these regions is the Caribbean, among the first outside of Europe to be integrated into world capitalism through colonialism five centuries ago. In recent decades, as the Caribbean's population has become entwined with global networks of production and finance in extremely unequal ways, scholars have begun to document shifting social patterns. While Caribbean societies throughout their history have exhibited many differences and continuities, the sweeping changes characteristic of globalization compel us to examine the region's changing political economy. With much of the Caribbean's population based in the Greater Antilles island chain (containing Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico), this geographic area will be referred to most often in my research. As many studies have been done on contemporary Puerto Rico (as an associated part of the U.S.) and on socialist Cuba, the case studies of this dissertation will focus on Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. In looking at these three countries, case studies will examine how their national economies have fragmented and become penetrated by global chains of accumulation. I will look at this specifically through the context of major global industries (cruise ship tourism, mining, export processing, and the role of migration and reverse flow of remittances). My introductory chapter reviews, synthesizes, and interprets existing sources and accounts on the development of capitalism in the Caribbean. Especially useful are a number of scholarly studies on the shifting modes of production in the Caribbean, from slave labor to wage labor and from European colonial mercantilism up to industrializing monopoly capitalism and into capitalist globalization albeit with the U.S. as the major hegemonic power in the region. Such studies are useful in helping to understand the history of social formation in the region. I also have read reports and data gathered by key political and economic forums active in the Caribbean and specifically with regard to some of the major global industries. This information is central for gaining a detailed understanding of the shifting material and social relations taking place in the region. In addition to the archival research, this dissertation's research is backed up by a multi-sited case study of the Caribbean region through ethnographic observations and interviews. This dissertation has aimed more precisely to synthesis my theoretical approach with my research findings. Rather than be chained to a rigid social experiment, I have moved back and forth between the questions I formulated and the data I collected. The methods I've outlined are not necessarily carried out in sequence, but rather according to the needs of the project. This flexibility has been necessary for a project of this scope.",,,
228,Cue them with kindness: A social-evolutionary approach to the early identification of caring partners,"Evolutionary perspectives on social bonding assert that individuals will best survive and thrive when they have close relationships with others who are responsive to their needs and invested in their welfare. However, it is unclear if and how individuals identify and select caring romantic partners at the relationship initiation phase. The present research integrates prior work and methods from two often distinct literatures (close relationships in social psychology and mating psychology) to test the following hypotheses: (a) there are cues to kindness or caregiving that can be reliably assessed by multiple perceivers; (b) these cues reflect meaningful information about the kindness or caregiving capacity of the targets (i.e., they are accurate); and (c) these cues influence romantic attraction, in both short-term and long-term contexts. In two face perception studies (N = 413), participants viewed photographs of the other sex and rated them on a number of evolutionarily relevant traits (e.g., kindness, dominance, physical attractiveness) as well as their desirability as a one-time sex partner, dating partner, or spouse. Results indicate that kindness can be assessed both reliably and accurately (as indexed by either behavioral codes of responsiveness from actual support interactions in Study 1, or self and partner ratings of kindness and support in Study 2), and that perceptions of kindness are a unique predictor of short-term and long-term romantic attraction, even controlling for other features known to influence attraction. Rater sex was an important moderator; female targets were assessed for kindness more accurately than male targets, by both male and female raters. In addition, both men and women preferred higher levels of kindness for all types of attraction, though the inclusion of other covarying traits moderated the strength of this relationship. Taken together, these results support the need for more targeted investigation into the role perceptions of and preferences for kindness play in mate selection processes.",,,
229,Functional genomics approaches for understanding neurological disorders,"Understanding how genetic variation (genotype) contributes to diverse traits (phenotype) is a grand challenge in biology and the overarching theme of this dissertation. Neurological disorders include over 600 diseases and affect the central and peripheral nervous systems. Communication, intelligence, memory, and consciousness -- fundamental abilities that have elevated humankind above the rest of the animal kingdom, are all susceptible to attack from neurological disorders. The contribution of genetic variation to human traits and diseases has been studied for over a century, revealing a strong genetic component to almost every phenotype examined. Establishing genetic associations and delineating their molecular mechanisms in neurological disorders can reveal insight into the establishment, restoration, and enhancement of key human traits. The commencement of my doctoral studies coincided with the emergence of two groundbreaking scientific achievements: whole-genome sequencing and induced pluripotent stem cells. Here, I used these seminal technological advancements in biology as novel approaches to establish phenotype-genotype connections in neurological disorders. Functional genomics aims to integrate high throughput genomic and transcriptomic data to understand the biological function of genetic variation. This dissertation is split into two parts presenting divergent functional genomics approaches to understand two neurological disorders: whole-genome sequencing in Alzheimer's disease and induced pluripotent stem cell modeling of Williams syndrome. In the first part of this thesis, I used whole-genome sequencing data to identify genetic variants modifying age at onset of Alzheimer's disease in the world's largest family affected with this disease. This family, living in Antioquia, the mountainous region surrounding the major Colombian city Medellin, suffers from a rare form of Alzheimer's caused by a single mutation. This mutation, originating spontaneously in a single Spanish Conquistador, crossed the Atlantic and permeated throughout the pueblos indigenas living in Colombia. Over generations of geographic and genetic isolation coupled with exponential population growth, this single mutation spread to thousands of individuals, all who will develop a form of Alzheimer's at an average age of just 49 years. By sequencing the entire genomes of individuals affected with this disease at a range of different ages, we sought to identify genetic variants controlling the onset of this disease. First, we established a pipeline to sift through the wealth of information in a single genome. Next, we examined the genomic locus spanning the causal mutation to show definitively that the mutation originated in a Spanish settler in the early 16th century. Finally, we found a set of genetic variants in a cluster of chemokines that modifies the onset of Alzheimer's in this family and possibly in the general Alzheimer's population as well. In the second part of this thesis, I used induced pluripotent stem cells from individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) to identify disease-relevant pathways, a first step in connecting gene deletions to complex neurological traits. Arising from a hemizygous microdeletion of ~30 genes on chromosome 7, WS offers one of the best platforms to dissect the contributions of specific genes to neurocognitive phenotypes. Among various symptoms of the syndrome including specific craniofacial abnormalities and a characteristic heart valve defect, hyper-social behavior and enhanced language despite intellectual impairment are unique to WS. Converting induced pluripotent stem cells to neurons effectively allows us to study the brains of these individuals and identify which of the deleted genes may contribute to the neurological hallmarks. Integrating high-throughput transcriptional profiling with chromatin-immunoprecipitation of a gene deleted in WS, we identify a critical developmental node dysregulated in WS and the WS-deleted gene contributing to this defect.",,,
230,"Soviet state feminism in Muslim Central Asia: urban and rural women in Tajikistan, 1924-1982","This research project assesses the Soviet campaign to emancipate Muslim women of Central Asia, with a specific focus on women in Tajikistan from 1924 to 1982. In 1924, the Bolshevik regime began an unprecedented campaign to forcibly emancipate the Muslim women of Tajikistan. The reforms included the unveiling of women, the enactment of progressive family code laws, and the expansion of education for Muslim girls and women of Tajikistan who are ethically Tajik and Uzbek. By the 1950s, the Soviet regime largely succeeded in putting an end to veiling, child marriage, polygamy, and bride payments. Yet today we see a resurgence in practices the Bolsheviks claimed to have eliminated. This study explains why these reforms failed to have a long-lasting impact on rural and urban women of Tajikistan.",,,
231,"Agricultural production in the 21st century: Land-use, diversity, pests and pesticides","Over the next 50 years, global food demand is forecast to double. Already it is estimated that agriculture covers about 40% of ice-free land, accounts for a third of greenhouse gas emissions, and contributes significantly to global biodiversity declines. One means to reduce the impact of agriculture on humans and natural systems is to ensure the efficient use of pesticides. Pesticides, especially insecticides, have numerous negative externalities for human and environmental health, and their efficient use is an economic, ecological and public health priority. How land use patterns influence insect pests and insecticide demand is of special concern, because productive and efficient land use is key to meeting future food demand. This research investigates the relationships between insecticide use and landscape configuration. It further investigates the importance of weather variability and data quality to understanding agriculture in the 21st Century. Finally, it explores ecological theory to understand how multiple natural enemies may coexist on a single resource species. Specifically, I address the following questions: 1) is landscape simplification a consistent driver of insecticide use across time, 2) is landscape simplification a consistent driver of insecticide use across space and throughout the varied growing regions of the US, and do annual weather patterns influence insecticide use? 3) Is satellite crop data sufficiently accurate to be applied to ecological and economic questions at the sub-county level? 4) Can coexistence be driven by non-consumptive ecological interactions? To address these questions I integrate ecological and economic theory, and apply multivariate statistical techniques to multi-year national or regional databases. I find that, contrary to expectations from ecological theory, landscape simplification does not consistently drive insecticide use over time (Chapter 1) or space (Chapter 2). This spatio-temporal variation helps explain the ambiguous results in the literature and implies that national land use policy will have very different effects on insecticide use if regional differences are ignored. To further understand the underlying mechanisms requires fine-scale spatial information of configuration and crop type. However, leveraging satellite data for sub-county information such as spatial configuration is well suited to simplified growing regions, but highly inaccurate elsewhere (Chapter 3). Lastly, I show natural enemies and other intermediate consumers can coexist with sufficiently strong non-consumptive effects of a top predator on the dominant consumer (Chapter 4). In 2007 US farmers applied ~70 million pounds of insecticide active ingredients. While farmers pay the purchase price, society pays for degradation of natural systems and harm to human health. To minimize the cost of insecticides to both farmers and society, now and under future climate change, we must understand what drives variation in insecticide use and what enables persistence of natural enemy diversity. My dissertation research informs these key gaps in our understanding.",,,
232,New technologies in green chemistry; Atroposelective synthesis towards korupensamine D,"Chemists and chemical companies alike are well aware of the large amounts of waste they generate, although until recently little attention has been paid to the waste flow in terms of cost and environmental consequences. By most estimates (roughly 85%) of organic waste produced comes in the form of organic solvents. Thus, our goal continues to be the reduction of waste by focusing on organic solvents, and getting those solvents out of reactions via replacement by micellar catalysis, as quantified by E Factors. Fluorinated compounds have blossomed in the pharmaceutical industry due to the better bioavailability through an increase in membrane permeability when compared to their non-fluorinated analogues. Micellar catalysis has been found to be amenable to radical-based trifluoromethylation of various heterocyclic compounds. Nanoreactors composed of the designer surfactant TPGS-750-M enable these substitution reactions to be performed in water at room temperature in modest to good yields in combination with Langlois' reagent (NaSO 2CF3) and t-BuOOH, negating the need for pre-functionalization. Trifluoromethylation of several heterocyclic arrays has been accomplished, including heteroaromatics. Aromatic halogens have long served as excellent handles for transition metal catalysis and directing groups in synthesis, with subsequent need for removal. Current protocols for such dehalogenations are cost prohibitive at scale, energy intensive, and generally call for harsh reaction conditions. The new surfactant, SPGS-550-M, ('Nok') in water with Fu's catalyst and a mild hydride source is used for facile debromination of aromatic compounds. These reactions take place at ambient temperatures. Furthermore, the aqueous mediums can be recycled, thus greatly reducing our dependence on organic solvents while furthering technologies in green chemistry. Chiral compounds and their syntheses have been an intellectual curiosity of organic chemists since the first chiral resolution of tartaric acid in 1848 by Louis Pasteur. We have taken on the challenge to induce axial chirality for the natural product korupensamine D with use of an internal aromatic auxiliary blocking one face of the coupling partner via pi-stacking. Korupensamine D has yet to be synthesized in its natural form, due to the inherent instability of the cis tetrahydroisoquinoline ring presenting an exciting, challenging exercise in stereo control.",,,
233,Along-strike tectonic variability in the central Himalaya,"The Himalayas are a surface manifestation of the ongoing collision of the Indian and Asian plates. As stress accumulates along the collision zone, it is released during large earthquakes that pose an enormous threat to the growing populations in the region. The destructive power of these earthquakes was demonstrated most recently by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in central Nepal, which caused over ten thousand casualties. Most large Himalayan earthquakes occur along the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT), which is the active plate boundary beneath the range. In addition to generating large earthquakes, tectonic movement along the MHT results in mountain building. Recent theoretical and technical advances have led to the realization that rates of rock uplift, which reflect the structure of the faults in the subsurface, are, to a degree, encoded into the landscape form (i.e., tectonics can be read from topography). Analysis of Himalayan topography reveals that the mountain front in western Nepal is characterized by two steps, as opposed to the rest of the central Himalaya, which features a single, dramatic mountain front. This distinction is likely related to a previously unknown along-strike change in the geometry and history of tectonic structures beneath the range. Specifically, it is hypothesized that mid-crustal deformation has recently shifted from the northern topographic step to the southern, raising a broad area between them that is now preserved as a high-elevation, low-relief landscape. In order to test the hypothesis that the study area in western Nepal is undergoing transient incision due to recent uplift of the low-relief landscape between the two mountain fronts, modern erosion rates are estimated in twelve watersheds that drain the two topographic steps and the high-elevation, low-relief landscape between them. Erosion rates vary by an order of magnitude and appear to be a function of watershed morphology, which is in turn a function of the watershed's position with respect to an upstream-migrating wave of incision that appears to be related to the hypothesized rejuvenated uplift along the southern mountain front. In a parallel study aimed at constraining the longer-term history of deformation in the study area, low-temperature thermochronology is employed to estimate rock-uplift rates from bedrock cooling ages. Inversion of these data using a thermo-kinematic model yields best-fit rock-uplift rates, which are compared to predictions from the hypothesis presented above. Results show that the main zone of rock uplift in well-studied central Nepal makes a sharp turn to follow the northern mountain front in western Nepal, away from the trend of the rest of the range, which would otherwise follow the southern mountain front. In contrast, rock uplift has been slow since ~10 Ma along the southern mountain front, and the hypothesized recent uplift there can be no older than 4 Ma. In summary, the recent tectonic history in western Nepal differs significantly from the trend exhibited in adjacent segments of the range. This distinction has important implications for the possible locations of future seismic activity, the paleoseismic record in western Nepal, and the ongoing evolution of the range.",,,
234,RNA assembly facilitated by long-range interactions and implications for RNA nanotechnology,"RNA nanotechnology is a growing field of research that aims to harness the functional potential of RNA for specific applications. The function of an RNA can be directly related to the native structure of the molecule, defined by combinations of recurrent structural building blocks termed motifs. Long-range assembly motifs are of critical importance during RNA folding and assembly. These long-range modules are often required for a molecule to find and stabilize its native fold, and can provide a means for intermolecular recognition and assembly. In the research presented here, we work to characterize specific long-range interactions derived from various natural RNAs, with a goal to understand their roles in RNA assembly and function. Characterization of assembly modules was performed primarily through biophysical techniques utilizing rationally designed RNA scaffolds. By improving our understanding of natural RNA assembly modules, we hope to garner insights concerning molecular design and regulation which could be of use for future endeavors in RNA nanotechnology.",,,
235,Spatial and temporal variation in biomass accumulation in southern California chaparral,"Wildfires are a common occurrence in chaparral shrublands, and post-fire patterns of biomass accumulation are important for understanding ecosystem productivity and fuel available for future fires. In this research, I examine patterns of biomass accumulation in southern California chaparral shrublands at early and late stages of post-fire recovery using a combination of detailed field work and remote sensing. Using field measurements of a site with adjacent stands of varying ages and high spatial resolution imagery, I examine patterns of species composition and associated levels of biomass to characterize long-term patterns in biomass accumulation. I also evaluate the potential for utilizing shrub growth ring widths to track annual biomass accumulation in the first decade of post-fire recovery, and test for the relationship between biomass and spatial variation in factors related to the energy and water balance. In addition, I examine the potential for extending the use of shrub growth rings to track biomass across larger spatial extents using satellite-based growth metrics. The study of stands of varying ages reveals that biomass shows substantial variation even within stands of the same age, and that species composition is different in younger stands of chaparral compared to the more mature stands. In the study of growth rings, I find that while measuring growth rings widths is a valuable method for tracking biomass accumulation in the first decade following a fire, there is no apparent relationship between biomass and factors related to the energy and water balance. Annual biomass growth, as estimated from shrub growth ring widths, shows a promising relationship with satellite-based metrics of annual growth, indicating the potential for further study of the relationship over larger spatial extents.",,,
236,Coastal ocean pH variability in the context of global change biology,"Anthropogenic carbon emissions are predicted to alter marine ecosystems. One such change is the decline in ocean pH, known as ocean acidification. Model predictions of ocean acidification have guided biological experiments for more than a decade. Many studies predict negative consequences of future ocean pH on marine species. To understand how species will respond to future conditions, however, knowledge of present-day pH exposures is necessary and often limited. In this dissertation, I described present-day pH variability in three coastal regions and used the data to design laboratory experiments assessing the physiological response of two organisms, sea urchins and mussels, to changing ocean conditions. As recorded by autonomous pH sensors, I found three unique patterns of coastal pH variability. Near-shore Antarctica was characterized by a steep seasonal increase in pH and pH variability during summer phytoplankton blooms. The northern Channel Islands, California, exhibited event-scale and diurnal pH variability due to primary production of phytoplankton and fixed vegetation. Only mild effects from upwelling were detected at the islands, suggesting that this region may become a spatial refuge from extreme low pH in the future. Finally, Oregon was characterized by event-scale decreases in pH due to periodic upwelling events. The results from this research show that many coastal species experience short-term changes in pH that are within the same magnitude of change predicted for ocean acidification by the end of the century. While such present-day exposures to pH variability may promote tolerance of future pH change, these near-shore regions are also characterized by unique patterns of thermal stress. I conducted two studies to investigate the interactive effects of pH and temperature on organismal physiology. First, Antarctic sea urchin, Sterechinus neumayeri, early developmental stages (EDSs) currently experience < 2 C seasonal warming and may only experience a few degrees of ocean warming over the next 100 years. Despite development under pH and temperatures outside of current exposures, S. neumayeri EDSs exhibited high tolerance of a one-hour heat stress test, suggesting this species may be more resilient to ocean change than previously thought. Second, unlike Antarctic species, intertidal species at mid-latitudes experience daily temperature fluctuations that can exceed four times end-century predictions of ocean warming, due to tidal cycles. In Oregon, upwelling events enhance this temperature range by periodically delivering cold, low pH water to the intertidal zone. Depending on sea water conditions simulating an upwelling event (cold, low pH) or wind relaxation (warm, high pH), the intertidal mussel Mytilus californianus generated different transcriptomic signatures of the cellular heat shock response, following exposure to aerial heat stress. This suggests that future changes in seawater conditions may alter the heat stress tolerance of M. californianus during low tides. The results from this dissertation highlight the importance of designing experiments that reflect species' present-day and future multi-stressor environment, in order to generate ecologically relevant conclusions. As anthropogenic stressors continue to take hold of coastal seas, understanding the biological consequences is critical for management and conservation efforts.",,,
238,Adhesion and detachment of capsules in flow,"In the present study, adhesion and detachment between a capsule and a rigid stationary boundary are investigated theoretically, numerically and experimentally. We have developed a numerical model coupling the boundary integral method for the motion of the fluids, a finite element method for the membrane mechanics and the Derjaguin approximation for the surface forces acting between the membrane and the solid boundary. Simulation results for the dynamics of thin film drainage, equilibrium contact radius and the dynamics of peeling of an adhered capsule under flow are reported and compared to scaling theories. We also experimentally investigated the adhesion and detachment of human serum albumin (HSA) capsules to a rigid stationary cylinder in a rectangular polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) channel with a pressure driven flow. The strength of adhesion between the capsule membrane and the cylinder is controlled by varying the concentration of a non-adsorbing polyelectrolyte in the suspending fluid which induces attractive depletion forces when the gap between the two surfaces is smaller than the size of the polyelectrolyte.",,,
239,Stochasticity and Synchrony in the Mammalian Circadian Network,"A vast majority of life on Earth exists in an environment where resource availability and environmental conditions are temporally periodic. There is therefore an evolutionary advantage for organisms to partition behavior into certain times of day. Circadian rhythms, endogenous near-24 hour oscillations in gene expression, perform this task. These rhythms exert control over a large fraction of biological processes, and as such are implicated in a wide range of diseases, especially metabolic and mental disorders. Circadian rhythms are generated at a single-cell level through a complex set of interlocked genetic feedback loops. Individual components of the circadian network are considered ""sloppy"" due to stochastic noise, and it is only through the interaction of cellular oscillators at a network level that precise rhythms are generated. Medically treating or reverse-engineering this complicated genetic architecture necessitates mathematical understanding at multiple physical scales, from cells to tissue. This thesis seeks to describe the complex dynamics and hierarchical organization of circadian rhythms in mammals through systems dynamics and mathematical approaches. The overarching theme of this work will be the interplay between stochasticity and synchronization in circadian rhythms. Stochastic noise and precise oscillation are not completely at odds, however. In this thesis, I first develop a model of the circadian oscillator which incorporates the core negative feedback loop and an important neuropeptide coupling pathway. I use this model to investigate claims about the roles of Cryptochrome isoforms within the core circadian clock, and show that despite seemingly-different roles, experimental data is consistent with a parallel role for Cryptochrome isoforms. Next, I present a method for inferring functional connections within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the mammalian ""master clock"", and describe the network structure within the SCN. Finally, I examine growth and development of the SCN in utero..",,,
240,Sacred Activism: Women's Participation in Reformation of Islamic Family Law,"In the past decade women's increased involvement in religious activism has led to contentious debates among religious scholars, women, and the state. My dissertation investigates to extend to which women's religious authority in Iran is bridging the gap between Islamic jurisprudence and gender justice in the realm of family law. This project further explores the degree to which female activists draw on Shi'i jurisprudence and the Iranian Constitution to authenticate their arguments on gender justice. In an effort to come to a better understanding of contemporary women's activism in Iran, I conducted a case study of a prominent Muslim women's coalition named E'telaf-I Islamiyyih Zanan (Women's Islamic Coalition). This organization promotes women's empowerment, gender justice, and policy reform through faith-based jurisprudence. By using a multidisciplinary approach, the dissertation explores the evolving roles of women as religious authorities and producers of religious knowledge, addressing how their scholarship challenges patriarchal interpretations of Islamic scriptures. Through this case study, much of the juristic debates and the gridlocks of modernity and modern states' struggle with traditional family organization are brought to light, and the questions of how women are negotiating tradition with modernity become more conspicuous. More broadly, this dissertation provides a nuanced analysis of the ways in which women's religious activism and authority impacts policy reform and women's empowerment. My research contends that women's sacred activism in contemporary Iran has contributed to creating religious knowledge that affects socio-legal institutions, and the nature of lawmaking in the Islamic Republic of Iran.",,,
241,Ion-mobility and computational modeling of biomolecular self-assembly and aggregation,"Protein self-assembly leading to fibril formation is an intriguing phenomenon that has been linked to pathological agents in devastating neurodegenerative diseases and has been found to have promising applications in the development of new functional materials. In this dissertation, a combination of ion-mobility mass spectrometry, high level molecular dynamics simulation and microscopy imaging has been employed to investigate the distributions of early oligomers, their conformational transitions in the presence of small-molecule modulators and the structures of toxic and non-toxic oligomers. A variety of biomolecule models was examined to elucidate the driving forces behind amyloid and non-amyloid self-assemblies, and to provide a new approach to aggregation propensity prediction.",,,
242,Detecting the stealthy distribution of malicious and abusive content online,"The Whac-A-Mole game of online abuse (e.g., malware, fake-AV) has provided cybercriminals with a strong evolutionary pressure to cooperate, and become masters of disguise. To survive, they collaborate: each cybercriminal specializes in one area of expertise, such as cloaking or exploit writing, and together they contribute to a modular malware-distributing infrastructure. These shared frameworks have become quite robust to takedowns, by being stealthy and avoiding single points of failure. When they get caught, they react quickly to continue operating; the current prevalent defenses, such as blacklists and AntiViruses, are left in chronic need of catching up. In this dissertation, we show how cybercriminals tap into the safe Internet routines of unsuspecting users, to redirect them to their own sites so to exploit them, via both malware and social engineering. We present a study on how cybercriminals can do so even on the most popular Internet sites, such as hbo.com, by compromising the weakest links in the trust relationships between sites. We then study how cloaking software misdirect security researchers and companies, making malicious sites appear inconspicuous to their security crawlers. We analyze top-shelf cloaking software to surface their most innovative capabilities, and we build an anti-cloaking pipeline to measure the level of sophistication of cloaking in the wild. Moreover, we passively detect these stealthy malicious distribution networks, leveraging telltale signs which may seem innocuous when closely monitoring single users getting compromised, but become incriminating evidence when aggregating the collective traffic of their victims. Thanks to this novel approach, we detect previously unknown malicious software that evades blacklists and AntiViruses, and we discover how ISP caching servers, which are deployed to ameliorate their clients' Internet connectivity, can inadvertently contribute to malware-distribution campaigns. Finally, we observe how automation, content spinning, and templating, employed by cybercriminals for scalability, generate content that can be traced back to the same source. We leverage this insight to actively explore these distribution networks, so to discover their various doorways efficiently.",,,
243,Defending Frankfurt: Moral Responsibility without Alternative Possibilities,"According to the Principle of Alternative Possibilities (PAP), a person is morally responsible for what he has done only if he could have done otherwise. This principle, or something like it, seems quite plausible. And it has played an important role in arguments for the incompatibility of moral responsibility with causal determinism, divine foreknowledge, and divine providence. Yet, despite it's intuitive appeal, PAP has not gone unchallenged. Beginning with Harry Frankfurt over forty years ago, a number of counterexamples (known as ""Frankfurt examples"") have been offered. Since that time, a sizeable literature has developed around Frankfurt's challenge. The traditional strategy for attacking PAP is to attack it directly by attempting to provide a counterexample to the principle, as Frankfurt did. However, an alternative approach is to attack some other principle that PAP is connected to in an important way. I pursue the second strategy, targeting the following principle: PAP(CC): When an agent is non-derivatively morally responsible for an action, he is so partly in virtue of having been able to have done otherwise. I think the fundamental intuition behind an alternative possibilities requirement on moral responsibility is found in PAP(CC). Although PAP does not entail PAP(CC), if one rejects PAP(CC), then, absent other arguments in favor of PAP, one has little reason to accept PAP. I argue that PAP(CC) is false. Some Frankfurt examples---so-called ""complete blockage"" cases---are successful counterexamples to PAP(CC). However, since PAP does not entail PAP(CC), it remains possible that PAP is true even if PAP(CC) is false. For this reason, I consider two other arguments offered in support of PAP: the W-defense and the Deontic Maxim Defense. I argue that these arguments are unsuccessful. I conclude that even if PAP is in fact true, we have very little reason to believe that it is. After more than forty years of debate, it is time to say farewell to PAP.",,,
244,A forward genetic study on neural tube development,"My dissertation work has focused on mapping and characterizing a spontaneous neural tube closure mutant, bugeye, in the marine, invertebrate chordate organism, Ciona savignyi. The work involved developing a new and rapid method of mutation mapping by next-generation DNA sequencing. This new method of mapping was tested on a previously identified Ciona intestinalis mutant whose genomic data was used to calibrate mapping parameters and the mapping program for Ciona genomes. After successful testing of the mapping program, it was applied to the new bugeye mutant in Ciona. Mapping revealed a unique and narrow signature of linkage in the Ciona bugeye mutant genomes over a predicted T-type calcium channel gene. Requirement for the T-type calcium channel gene in neural tube closure was tested by CRISPR mediated knockout in wild type embryos and definitively established causality of the gene for the bugeye mutant phenotype. The bugeye mutant was investigated for previously known characteristics of neural tube closure mutants such as neural specification, cellular polarity and apical constriction defects. My results did not support any of these possibilities and rather support the hypothesis that bugeye is a failure to maintain a sealed anterior neuropore. To further explore and expand this previously uncharacterized role for T-type calcium channel genes, I tested for conservation of function in the vertebrate model Xenopus. Knockdown of the orthologous and earliest expressed T-type calcium channel gene, CAV3.2, in Xenopus laevis embryos via splice-disrupting morpholinos resulted in an open brain phenotype with characteristics similar to that of the bugeye mutants -- a failure to seal the anterior neuropore. The function of T-type calcium channels in neural tube closure was tested in both Xenopus and Ciona: cellular calcium fluctuations, using the genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP3, were investigated in the context of neurulation and T-type calcium channel disruption. I also investigated a downstream target of T-type calcium channels and a previously known neural tube closure gene family, the EphrinA family of ligand-receptor signaling molecules. My results found that the bugeye mutant phenotype, open brain, could be rescued by down regulation of EphrinA signaling in the neural tube. The cumulative results allowed us to propose a model of T-type calcium channel function in neural tube closure via EphrinA signaling and suggest future directions to further explore this newly established role for T-type calcium channels in sealing the anterior neuropore.",,,
245,Structure-function relationships and biological applications of conjugated oligoelectrolytes,"Microorganisms like bacteria have evolved over billions of years to survive in diverse environments and have developed unique functions and metabolic pathways as a result. Manipulating and harnessing their abilities has been a hallmark of the biotechnology revolution and has the potential to solve problems in areas as diverse as health, environmental remediation and energy production. With genetic engineering we now have the ability to install in microbes beneficial functionalities and chemical production processes, but have really just scratched the surface of what is possible. Truly disruptive innovations will come from controllably interfacing these microscopic workhorses with non- living systems in an effort that will likely require both genetic engineering and materials science approaches. It is with this premise that I present my research on a class of synthetic small molecules known as conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs). These water-soluble oligomers spontaneously intercalate into biological membranes and in turn modify the ionic and electronic transport properties of this ubiquitous interface in a variety of microorganisms. COEs have previously been shown to improve the performance of microbial electronic devices for power production and contaminant removal in wastewater. The research presented here demonstrates the use of COEs for the inverse process of powering a microbe, Shewanella, in order to drive metabolic activity, specifically the reduction of fumarate to succinate. A mechanistic investigation of this process utilizing various voltammetry techniques, microscopy, liquid chromatography, and visible spectroscopy reveals possible membrane permeabilization and enzyme excretion, contradicting a previous hypothesis of COEs acting like transmembrane ""molecular wires."" In addition, structure-function relationships for COEs are developed through examination of the effects of different molecular features on various biological systems. Using microscopy and electrochemistry, some effects of ionic group type and arrangement on the biological interactions of COEs are revealed. It is determined that cationic charges are necessary for interaction with E. coli and that a terminal end-only arrangement of charges is beneficial for lipid membrane intercalation. Finally through visible spectroscopy and zeta potential measurements it is determined that longer COEs associate in less quantity with E. coli but affect the cell surface charge to a greater degree than do shorter COEs. It is these relationships that will ultimately lead to new biological applications and inform future molecular design of this exciting class of molecules.",,,
246,Localized visual feature representations for classification and visual search,"This research focuses on introducing new localized descriptions for segmentation, classification, and visual search. The proposed feature embeds relative spatial information by learning different image parts while having a compact representation. First, an attributed graph representation of an image is created based on segmentation and localized image descriptors. Subsequently, communities of image regions are discovered based on their spatial and visual characteristics over all images. The community detection problem is modeled as a spectral graph partitioning problem. This results in finding meaningful image part groupings. A histogram of communities forms a robust and spatially localized representation for each image in the database. Such a region-based representation enables searching through image databases for smaller objects/regions of interest that are not currently otherwise possible. Further, such a representation also enables image search for specific spatial configurations of objects. The goal is to search the database for images that contain similar objects (image-patches) with a given spatial configuration, size and position. Our representations are robust to segmentation variations, and a sub-graph matching method is used to compare the query with the database items. In the third part of this thesis, we present a weakly-supervised approach to semantic segmentation. The goal is to assign pixel-level labels given only partial information, for example, image-level labels. This is an important problem in many application scenarios where it is difficult to get accurate segmentation or not feasible to obtain detailed annotations. We start with an initial coarse segmentation, followed by a spectral clustering approach that groups related image parts into communities. A community-driven graph is then constructed that captures spatial and feature relationships between communities while a label graph captures correlations between image labels. Mapping the image level labels to appropriate communities is formulated as a convex optimization problem. Lastly, we present a novel framework for querying multi-modal data from a heterogeneous database containing images, textual tags, and GPS coordinates. We construct a bi-layer graph structure using localized image-parts and associated GPS locations and textual tags from the database. The proposed network model enables us to use flexible multi-modal queries on the database. In all the above cases, extensive experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform current state-of-the-art.",,,
247,A search for the pair production of scalar top quarks in hadronic final states with the CMS detector,"The known elementary particles and their interactions are described with incredible accuracy by the Standard Model of particle physics. Despite its success, strong experimental and theoretical concerns point to the likely existence of physics beyond the standard model, including the lack of an explanation for the vast quantity of Dark Matter and Dark Energy within this framework and the incredible level of fine-tuning required for the theory to be compatible with the measured Higgs boson mass. Supersymmetry is a broader theory that addresses many of these problems. In this dissertation I describe a search for the direct pair production of the supersymmetric partner of the top quark in hadronic final states with missing transverse momentum. This search is performed on a dataset of proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 18.9 fb-1 collected at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV with the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The pair production of top quarks with a single lepton in the final state, the production of a Z boson decaying to two neutrinos, and the associated production of a top quark pair with no leptons in the final state and a Z boson decaying to neutrinos form significant Standard Model backgrounds to this search. The background is suppressed with a number of techniques that include high efficiency lepton identification, a dedicated top quark pair reconstruction algorithm, and search regions defined with multivariate techniques. The background yields in the search regions are estimated with an extensive study of the processes in data control regions. The data are compatible with the predicted backgrounds and the results are interpreted as exclusion limits in terms of the Simplified Model Spectra framework. The sensitivity of this search to models with a top squark decaying to jets and a neutralino through a on-shell top quark extends to 775 GeV in top squark mass and to 650 GeV in models with a top squark decaying through an intermediate chargino.",,,
248,Electron Emission Spectroscopy of InGaN/GaN Light Emitting Diodes,"The effect of efficiency droop in light emitting diodes (LEDs) is a huge roadblock for consumer lighting adoption. To prevent loss of efficiency from droop, LEDs must be operated at lower current density, requiring a larger epitaxial area and increasing the overall cost. Proposed mechanisms responsible for droop include, among others, carrier delocalization from indium rich regions, overshoot and leakage current, and Auger recombination. Current methods used to understand droop mechanisms are indirect, and often rely on models that have no unique solution. It is clear that a direct measurement method and a deeper understanding of the fate of injected carriers not contributing to radiative recombination is needed to focus improvement efforts on materials and structures to help identify and mitigate the relevant droop mechanism(s). By analyzing the energy of vacuum emitted electrons from a forward biased LED, we can gain direct information of their origin internally. The study of vacuum emitted electrons has existed for almost 130 years with the discovery of the photoelectric effect. Advancements in electron energy analysis techniques have led to the direct measurement of conduction band structures and transport properties in many commonly used semiconductors such as: InP, GaAs, Si, and recently GaN. The kinetic energy of the vacuum emitted electrons from an InGaN/GaN LED was analyzed and three peaks were identified: First, a low energy peak, resulting from photoexcited electrons generated by diode light. Second, a mid-energy peak, generated by the accumulation of thermalized electrons at the bottom of the Gammaconduction band valley. Third, a high-energy peak is generated by an accumulation of electron at the bottom of a low lying side-valley ""L"". Auger recombination is uniquely identifiable as it is the only proposed droop mechanism capable of generating hot carriers and solely responsible for the population of electrons found in the L-valley. Two control experiments were carried out to strengthen our interpretation. First a simple GaN pn junction was measured and generated only a single Gamma-valley peak. Second, selective detection of photoemission under modulated light from an LED in forward bias confirms that only the low energy peak is photogenerated and that LED light incapable of generating the higher energy Gamma or L-valley peaks. Lastly, we discuss the new UCSB electron energy analyzer as well as some proposed future experiments to advance the electron emission technique.",,,

250,Advances at the interface: merging information technologies with genomic methodologies,"Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule whose importance towers like a colossus in the sweeping field of biomedicine. The chemical structure of double stranded DNA is itself a helical tower that forms not only the backbone of medical research, but of life itself. Yet, we cannot let DNA be constrained to this role of solid, rigid building block if we wish to utilize its full potential. In its single stranded form, DNA can take on unexpected tertiary shapes that allow it to interact with polymerases, proteins, and organic molecules. This ability gives nucleic acids immense potential for molecular recognition. From monitoring a state of health to identifying toxins in drug development, using DNA as a sensing element can bring valuable information. Clinical diagnostics have benefited enormously from the sensitivity, specificity, and rapidity of nucleic acid testing (NAT). It can be easy to take blood donor screening, heritable genotyping of newborns, and other standard operating procedures for granted in the developed world. Developing nations with as few as one physician for every 100 people are lacking in the healthcare infrastructure (to say the least) to provide these molecular tests. The key to unlocking the progressions made by NAT in identifying causative agents of disease comes in the form of a ubiquitous tool: mobile phones. Almost 7B people in the world own cell phones. By combining the optical imaging capabilities and computational powers of mobile phones with a streamlined amplification platform, the ability to detect diseases becomes available to those who could truly reap its benefits. The synergistic nature of merged technologies is something that extends beyond nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) to analysis of recombinant DNA products. Most fields have single-use products that are essential for one purpose but otherwise hidden from view. When brought to the attention of other disciplines, nucleic acid analysis tools such as next generation sequencing (NGS) can segue from providing information on full genomes to identifying highly represented DNA affinity agents from candidate pools. Bringing the systems of particle display, high throughput sequencing (HTS), and in situ microarray synthesis to a sequence selection process enhances screening capabilities to the extent that hundreds of sequences can be identified en masse as binding to thousands of targets.",,,
251,Local Identity in the Face of Empire: Loro Ceramics of the Middle Horizon Peruvian South Coast,"The production and use of Loro ceramics in the Middle Horizon (c. 750-1000 CE) persisted during a period of cultural conflict as the highland Wari empire annexed the south coastal region of Peru. The Loro peoples, primarily residing in the Las Trancas river valley, developed a discrete and little known ceramic style with abstracted iconography and distinctive formal features that reflects their position within the political and social landscape. As the Wari controlled the economics, politics, and religious landscape of the remainder of the south coastal Nazca region, the Loro polity developed tight ethnic bonds and maintained autonomy for the duration of the Wari empire's presence. In this dissertation, I examine the physical and visual elements of Loro ceramics, situating these objects within the extant archaeological data, and proposing a definition of the style. I ultimately demonstrate that, through their ceramic forms, technique, and imagery, the Loro established a resolute group identity in a striking political response to the intrusive Wari empire. That the Loro rejected the hegemony of the Wari is discernable through settlement patterns, bioarchaeology, and the visual language of their ceramic iconography. Notable for its starkly abstracted imagery, disavowal of symmetry, and loose brushstroke in the painting technique, Loro fineware intentionally opposed the naturalistic, calculated, and precise aesthetic of Wari material culture. In particular, the Loro embodied their local identity on face-neck jars, one-handled vessels consisting of a modeled human head atop a globular body. With standardized facial features, a range of reductive motifs, and a tendency toward female representation, Loro face-neck jars contrast markedly with similar Wari vessels depicting individuals dressed in elite male costume and bearing symbols of Wari state religion, leading me to argue that the Loro deployed their face-neck jars to solidify social cohesion and to emphasize difference. This dissertation situates the form and style of this culture in its social, political, and geographical contexts, examining the Loro as a case study of a local group's material response to imperial presence.",,,
252,Moderated Mediation Hypotheses in Regression Analytic Models: Method Illustrations Using Survey Data,"This applied study presented method illustrations of the regression analytic models for moderated mediation hypotheses using data from a survey program. In spite of the theoretical and empirical importance of employing appropriate models for analyzing moderated mediation hypotheses, or conditional indirect effects in social and behavioral science research, there have been limited examples of formally testing those effects in the literature of applied psychology or education mainly due to the lack of clear methods for examining these effects. Therefore formal methods that were initially introduced and organized by Preacher, Rucker, & Hayes (2007), Hayes (2011), and Hayes (2013) were illustrated with the use of commercially available statistical software packages of IBM SPSS Statistics Version 23 (IBM, 1989-2015) and M plus Version 6.11 (Muthen and Muthen, 1998-2011) using data from The Positive Body Image Survey (Romo, Mireles-Rios, & Nylund-Gibson, 2012). The focus population of the survey was a group of adolescent girls with the intentions to identify behavioral factors that contribute to their resilience in spite of sociocultural pressures that tend to produce negative feeling about their bodies, and to examine whether positive body perceptions can lead to the practice of health-promoting lifestyle. Results from this study will help applied researchers using models for moderated mediation hypotheses, or conditional indirect effects as to how social or behavioral phenomena in substantive areas of the study can be better understood. Results from this dissertation highlight the importance of framing research questions about positive body image development among Latino adolescent girls in terms of path analytic models with protective factors specified as a predictor variable, positive body image as a mediator variable, and engagement in health-promoting behaviors as an outcome variable. Findings of this study provide evidence that this mediation models can be affected by moderator variables of interest.",,,
253,Communicating Distance: What This Means for Environmental Public Opinion,"Political scientists have spent decades providing explanations for political support of policy proposals. On the one hand, individuals appear to concern themselves with the personal risks or benefits of a project; on the other, their appraisals appear to be more ideologically based, ultimately aligning with one's party. While many argue this is a product of an unknowing and uninterested public, simply swaying one direction and then the other, this research promotes a different stance: perceived psychological distance helps to explain variation in political attitude formation, accounting for which considerations an individual will turn to in one instance and which they will rely on in another when developing their stance of communicating the issues. This dissertation asks how perceived psychological distance relates to energy perceptions and political communication. According to the Construal Level Theory (CLT) of psychological distance, from social psychology, evaluations and behaviors differ based on the extent to which something is perceived as psychologically ""proximate"" or ""distant"" (Trope & Liberman 2010). Psychological distance has yet to be applied to political attitudes and communication and yet its utility is intuitive --- 1) politicians strategically communicate to make issues more ""proximate"" or ""distant"" and 2) political perceptions and actions likely vary depending on the extent to which they are viewed as ""proximate"" or ""distant"". To investigate this question, this research maps psychological distance onto energy politics across two domains, public opinion and communication. The first study relies on a survey of residents along the proposed Keystone XL route. Half of the respondents are asked about their attitudes toward Keystone XL (the proximate issue) and half are asked about their attitudes toward offshore oil drilling (the distant issue). Each of the respondents is given objective information about the issues, with half of the sample also receiving a pro-development frame emphasizing the benefits of the project. Results indicate that distance serves to moderate attitudes, with those asked about the proximate issue exhibiting a significant framing effect compared to those asked about the distant issue who were unmoved by the frame. The second study assesses the extent to which online communications reflect the expectations of CLT. Analysis of over a million tweets related to Keystone XL finds little difference between how those living more proximate to the issue frame it compared to those living further away. In general, both appear to prefer concrete frames related to jobs, local economy, spills and environmental risk. Similarly, manual coding from the Linguistic Category Model (LCM) suggests the abstractness of the tweets also do not vary due to distance. However, the expectations from CLT do appear to apply to retweets. In this case, individuals more proximate to the pipeline were more likely to retweet concrete tweets and those further from the pipeline more likely to retweet abstract tweets. This suggests the persuasiveness of a tweet varies by distance. The final study applies CLT to political advocacy groups, arguing they should recognize differences in persuasiveness due to the location of the target audience and adjust their strategies accordingly. I identified local and national advocacy groups in favor of or opposed to the pipeline and analyzed their Twitter communications as well as the effectiveness of these communications. According to the results, local and national groups rely on a mix of frames in order to appeal to a broad section of the U.S. public (those living closer or further from the pipeline). However, this is less so the case for the pro-Keystone XL groups, likely due to the fact that they have fewer resource constraints and are therefore not as reliant on broad public support. The study also finds that in general these frames tend to be more concrete than abstract, contrary to the expectations of CLT. At the same time, the public appears to prefer concrete frames, retweeting these more often than abstract frames. This work examines the relationship between physical proximity and public opinion in order to better understand some of the previously unexplained variation in environmental public opinion. Together, the studies suggest that distance matters to public opinion and political communication, but the relationship is highly context dependent. In the media effects setting, distance moderates framing effects. Similarly, when exposed to online communications from elites, members of the public are more or less persuaded by these based on their geographic proximity to the policy issue. However, this is not similarly reflected other communication settings, such as political advocacy group activities and within network online communications. Thus, other facets of the political environment appear to influence the role of distance in public opinion and political communication. The messiness of politics requires additional investigation into when distance helps us account for political variability.",,,
254,Rethinking Rural Spaces: Lived Experiences of Politics and Political Information in Appalachia,"How do Appalachians receive and understand information about politics? How do these individual's experiences of identity and community influence how they interpret the political information that they receive from media outlets and social interactions? Does the information that Appalachians receive from media sources and social interactions influence decision-making in regards to voting and other forms of political participation? Studies that focus on southern Appalachia, identity, and political information in the United States are very few in number and leave all of the above questions open. The few studies that specifically address southern Appalachians, identity, and politics focus on elite women from rural areas where the subjects are rural women that run for elected office and women members of Congress that are elected from rural districts. Further, the existing studies of identity and politics in southern Appalachia use mostly quantitative methods that are not able to capture the social and individual processes that affect how Appalachians understand political information. The purpose of this dissertation study is to begin answering the previously stated questions by examining how Appalachian communities along with gender, race, sexuality, and class identities affects how political information is understood in Appalachian North Carolina. Answering these questions is important in helping gain a greater understanding of gender, race and politics, political communication, and American politics as a whole. The project uses a multi-methods approach that includes archival research, demographic statistical data, participant observation, and in-depth, semi-structured interviews, and focuses on ""Dash County"" (a pseudonym) in Appalachian North Carolina. Participants are found to hold multiple identities where, depending on the context, some identities become more salient than others. Participants are found to hold internally inconsistent political and social opinions, regardless of the level of political knowledge an individual possesses. Women and men who participated in the study, regardless of demographic differences, reported roughly equal levels of political engagement. Finally, the roles of community proximity and associations have an effect on the likelihood of individuals receiving political information and discussing politics with their community peers.",,,
255,"The Commodification of Buddhist Objects in Amdo, Tibet, China","Classical Tibetan Buddhist scriptures proscribe the sale of images of the Buddha, religious texts, and particular ritual implements. Such acts are considered sinful and are believed to carry negative karmic consequences. Prior to the Cultural Revolution, artists and craftsmen were almost always commissioned to create such objects, and they were paid primarily through voluntary offering. This was the socially and religiously accepted means of exchange for such objects. However, following the ""opening-up"" of religion in China, the marketization of China's economy, and the introduction of ethnic tourism to Tibetan areas in the 1980s, Tibetans have begun to sell prefabricated religious objects at fixed, market prices for their personal livelihood in what appears to be a violation of the religious injunctions against their sale. This dissertation aims to understand Tibetans' commodification of Buddhist objects in the contemporary context and focuses on the causes and outcomes of these commercial practices. Drawing upon textual and historical analysis, as well as ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Amdo (Qinghai Province), it argues that we must understand Tibetans' commodification of religious objects not only as a response to the introduction of free market capitalism in China, but also as a Tibetan response to the socioeconomic and political conditions and circumstances resulting from particular policies enacted by the Chinese Communist Party. Furthermore, while Tibetans' commodification of religious objects has led to practical benefits, such practices are also transforming religious traditions, practices, and values in the ""moral economy"" associated with religious objects and contributing to a reinterpretation of Tibetan Buddhist identity. As such, Tibetans' sale of religious objects challenges current and more positivist perspectives on the effects of commodification by revealing that while such practices can have positive results, they come at the price of transforming the traditional worldview.",,,
256,Modeling and control of an actuated Stirling engine,"This work proposes a new Stirling engine design which we refer to as an actuated Stirling engine. The thermodynamic cycle which drives the engine is controlled by the motion of the displacer piston. In traditional designs this motion is a result the design parameters of the engine. In the Beta engine design the motion of the displacer is determined by the design of the flywheel, while in a free piston design the motion is determined by the restorative force applied to the displacer (be that from a gas spring used in some designs or a mechanical spring used in others). This work proposes a new design wherein the displacer motion is directly controlled via an actuator. This allows for more direct control over the thermodynamic process which drives the engine. To answer the question of how well this engine design compares to a more traditional engine, the best possible design of both engines are compared to one another. This requires optimizing not only the proposed design, but the more traditional design as well. The traditional Beta engine design is chosen as the benchmark with which the actuated design is compared to. Optimizing the design of the Beta engine is a standard parameter optimization problem, as the motion of the pistons is determined by the flywheel parameters. Optimizing the actuated engine is more difficult as it requires finding the optimal trajectory of the displacer, which is an optimal control problem. This work is divided into two sections. In the first section the problem of optimally designing both the actuated and Beta engine designs is solved using a very simple of the Stirling engine, the isothermal (or Schmidt) model. In the second section the same design problem is solved but with a much higher fidelity engine model. The large state dimension of the high fidelity model makes it ill suited for use in an optimization algorithm. To resolve this, a method of model reduction is proposed and applied to the high fidelity model to yield a reduced model more suitable for use in an optimization algorithm. For both the simple isothermal and high fidelity models it is shown that the actuated design has the potential to significantly outperform the more traditional Beta engine design.",,,
257,The effect of nitrogen functionalities on the durability of Pt on carbon black fuel cell electrodes,"Hydrogen fuel cells convert chemical energy to electrical energy with greater efficiency than traditional energy sources while having zero carbon emissions. Pt catalyst particles degrade over long operating times, resulting in decreased fuel cell performance. Nitrogen doping carbon nanotubes has been shown to increase the stability of the Pt catalyst. However, there is disagreement over which N species leads to the increased stability. This thesis work employed a controlled synthetic approach to modify the carbon support in order to survey a wide range of N-containing molecules and determine which leads to the best stabilization of Pt nanoparticles. In our proof-of-concept study, 4-(aminomethyl)pyridine (4AMP) was covalently attached to Vulcan carbon black (VC) using organic synthesis. Pt nanoparticles were deposited and we showed the covalent functionalization of Vulcan led to small Pt nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. In addition, cyclic voltammetry (CV) exhibited a two-fold improvement in specific current for Pt/4AMP-VC compared to Pt/VC and Pt/4AMP-VC was 4 times more durable. Next we extended our synthetic technique to investigate the durability of Pt on amide, pyridine, pyrrole, and imidazole functionalities. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests that Pt preferentially binds the pyridinic N in the pyridine and imidazole functionalities. Pt also strongly interacts with the pyrrolic N in the pyrrole functionality. Durability cycling 6,000 times was performed via CV and the change in Pt particle size was monitored with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We have shown that the order of decreasing durability is imidazole > pyridine > pyrrole > amide > benzene > bare VC. While controlled organic synthetic techniques are advantageous for comparing specific N-heterocycle molecules in the lab, this multistep procedure is not ideal for commercialization. Constant potential electrolysis was applied to easily attach 4AMP to a commercial carbon electrode and Pt was subsequently electrodeposited. Fuel cell testing demonstrated the Pt/4AMP anode generated 24 times more gravimetric power than a commercial ETEK anode.",,,

AMD etiology is still not completely understood, and treatments for the most common form of the disease, geographic atrophy, are lacking. There are many animal models for AMD. Yet, no single model completely recapitulates the disorder. Cell culture models are another method used to recreate certain aspects of the disease. However, cell-based ""disease-in-a-dish"" models are currently not well developed. This dissertation focuses on the development and applications of new cell culture based models for macular degeneration.",,,
259,An Investigation of Criterion Shifting in a Recognition Memory Task across the Lifespan,"A critical aspect of recognition memory is the integration of available memory evidence and a decision criterion. Episodic retrieval and criterion shifting involve distinct brain regions that are engaged differentially across individuals depending on unique characteristics and strategies. In this study we attempted to quantify how aging interacts with such factors in their influence on criterion placement during recognition memory. Recognition memory and criterion shifting behavior and brain activity were examined in late adolescents (age 18), young (ages 25-33) and older (ages 60-75) adults during an fMRI task. We also assessed individuals on over 100 variables that may mediate one's willingness and ability to shift decision criterion. On average, discriminability, criterion placement, and shifting for high- and low-target probability conditions were similar across groups. Of particular interest is our criterion shifting results, given mixed findings across other studies. It appears that when predictable shifts are required and when changes in demands are clear and unambiguous, as is the case with our design, older adults have the cognitive capacity to adapt in a more optimal manner. Furthermore, we found large variability in the degree to which individuals shift their decision criterion between conditions. Using a hierarchical regression approach, we identified a group of key variables that accounted for over 30% of the variance in criterion shifting. After controlling for these variables, age did not emerge as having any additional explanatory power of that variance, suggesting that differences in inherent characteristics are more important in explaining the variability in criterion shifting than age alone. As individuals age, the brain undergoes considerable structural and functional changes which mediate the decline of higher-order cognition. Several studies have demonstrated age-related over-recruitment of brain regions typically involved in retrieval in younger adults, perhaps in an attempt to compensate for other age-related impairments. However, no study has examined criterion-shifting-related activity in young and older adults. Our results showed that both young and older adults activated a number of frontoparietal regions that are a hallmark of successful episodic memory retrieval for both successful retrieval (hits vs. correct rejections) and criterion shifting (switch vs. same trials) contrasts. Whole-brain analyses revealed no evidence of over-recruitment by older adults for either successful retrieval (hits vs. correct rejections) or criterion shifting (switch vs. same trials), although regional analyses revealed that younger adults actually showed greater activity in right parietal regions. Given that no significant positive correlation was found between criterion shifting behavior and activity in these regions, combined with the equivalent criterion shifting behavior observed in our older adults, it appears that right parietal activation is not necessarily beneficial for shifting performance. We further discuss that the lack of over-recruitment by older adults in our study is not usual, particularly when a yes/no recognition memory is utilized and performance is matched. Both our behavioral and performance results suggest that our recognition memory task and its underlying criterion shift manipulation involved a manageable amount of cognitive load resulting in similar performance and brain activation for young and older adults.",,,
260,"Advances in organic synthesis via micellar catalysis using benign ""designer"" surfactants","Focus has been to develop new technologies that are both useful and sustainable to the synthetic community by following the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry. By utilizing micellar catalysis we can facilitate synthetic organic transformations in water at room temperature. This is achieved using nanoparticles derived from tailor-made amphiphiles, designed to both self-aggregate into micellar arrays and enable, at very low concentrations in water, C-C, C-heteroatom, and C-H bond constructions. Through direct quantitation, in the form of comparative E Factors, we document how these methodologies can greatly reduce our dependence on toxic organic solvents (i.e., dipolar aprotic, chlorinated) associated with many of the most commonly used transition metal-catalyzed couplings. Additionally, given the huge dependence on dipolar, aprotic solvents such as DMF, DMSO, DMAc, and NMP in substitution research, we demonstrate how TPGS-750-M in water can mimic these solvents (e.g., DMF) to perform nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions (SNAr) using micellar catalysis. Additionally, Suzuki-Miyaura cross-couplings utilizing N-methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronate derivatives demonstrate that only water is necessary as the reaction medium when micellar catalysis is employed. This includes reaction setup to product isolation, thereby completely eliminating the use of organic solvents for one of the most utilized organic transformations within the chemistry community. Lastly, through an attenuation strategy, Suzuki-Miyaura cross-couplings involving challenging 2-pyridyl MIDA boronates have been developed that rely on only palladium as the catalyst. Typically reported conditions include non-catalytic amounts of copper in order for the cross-coupling to be achieved. This strategy sheds insight on how to access, and utilize for synthetic gain, water stable 2-pyridyl boronic acids formed in situ via a slow-release mechanism with particular substituents at the 6-position of the pyridyl core.",,,
261,"New middle Cambrian hyolith genus and species and echinoderm ossicles from the Georgina Basin, Australia","The study herein describes a new genus and species of orthothecid hyolith and numerous echinoderm ossicles. The internal mold of the hyolith bears an apical ridge and is of uniform width, distinguishing it from other known hyoliths. Biological significance of its internal apical structure is unclear, though hypotheses proposed include a streamlining effect and presence of a terminal spine on the original shell. Inclusion of the supposed Circotheca stylus depicted in Dzik (1980: fig. 7) into this species expands the newly described hyolith's geographic range to Baltica and extends its temporal occurrence into the Late Cambrian. Some of the ossicles resemble echinoderm taxa (e.g., stylophorans and eocrinoids), but many ossicle morphologies share little to no similarities to known Cambrian echinoderms. Several fragmented ossicles bear phosphatic casts around their pores similar to Cantabria labyrinthica remains. Such results suggest that C. labyrinthica may represent echinoderm ossicles, not lobopodian plates as originally proposed by Clausen and Alvaro (2006).",,,
262,2D Steep Transistor Technology: Overcoming Fundamental Barriers in Low-Power Electronics and Ultra-Sensitive Biosensors,"In order to sustain the unprecedented growth of the Information Technology, it is necessary to achieve dimensional scalability along with power reduction, which is a daunting challenge. In this dissertation, two-dimensional (2D) materials are explored as promising materials for future electronics since they can, not only enable dimensional scaling without degradation of device electrostatics but it is also shown here, that they are highly potential candidate for interconnects and passive devices. 2D semiconductors are investigated for transistor applications, and novel approach for doping using nanoparticle functionalization is developed. It is also demonstrated that these materials can lead to ideal transfer characteristics. Aimed towards on-chip interconnect and inductor applications, the first detailed methodology for the accurate evaluation of high-frequency impedance of graphene is presented. Using the developed method the intricate high-frequency effects in graphene such as Anomalous Skin Effect (ASE), high-frequency resistance and inductance saturation, intercoupled relation between edge specularity and ASE and the influence of linear dimensions on impedance are investigated in detail for the first time. While 2D materials can address the issue of dimensional scalability, power reduction requires scaling of power supply voltage, which is difficult due to the fundamental thermionic limitation in the steepness of turn-ON characteristics or subthreshold swing (SS) of conventional Field-Effect-Transistors (FETs). To address this issue, a detailed theoretical and experimental analysis of fundamentally different carrier transport mechanism, based on quantum mechanical band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) is presented. This dissertation elucidates an underlying physical concept behind the BTBT process and provides clear insight into the interplay between electron and hole characteristics of carriers within the forbidden gap during tunneling. Moreover, a novel methodology for increasing the BTBT current through incorporation of metallic nanoparticles at the tunnel junction is proposed and theoretically analyzed, followed by experimental demonstration as proof of concept, which can open up new avenues for enhancing the performance of Tunneling-Field-Effect-Transistors (TFETs). This dissertation, also establishes, for the first time, that the material and device technology which have evolved mainly with an aim of sustaining the glorious scaling trend of Information Technology, can also revolutionize a completely diverse field of bio/gas-sensor technology. The unique advantages of 2D semiconductor for electrical sensors is demonstrated and it is shown that they lead to ultra-high sensitivity, and also provide an attractive pathway for single molecular detectability- the holy grail for all biosensing research. Moreover, it is theoretically illustrated that steep turn-ON characteristics, obtained through novel technology such as BTBT, can result in unprecedented performance improvement compared to that of conventional electrical biosensors, with around 4 orders of magnitude higher sensitivity and 10-fold lower detection time. With a view to building ultra-scaled low power electronics as well as highly efficient sensors, new generation of van-der Waal's BTBT junctions combining 2D with 3D materials is proposed and experimentally demonstrated, which not only retain the advantages of 2D films but also leverages the matured doping technology of 3D materials, thus harnessing the best of both worlds. These attributes are instrumental in the achievement of unprecedented BTBT current, which is more than 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of best reported 2D heterojunctions till date. Finally, with the optimization of the novel heterojunctions, this dissertation also achieves a significant milestone, furnishing the first experimental demonstration of TFETs based on 2D channel material to beat the fundamental limitation in subthreshold swing (SS). This device is the first ever TFET, in a planar architecture to achieve sub-thermionic SS over 4 decades of drain current, a necessary characteristic prescribed by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors and in fact, the only TFET to date, to achieve so, in any architecture and in any material platform, at a low power-supply voltage of 0.1 V. It also represents the world's thinnest channel sub-thermionic transistor, thus, cracking the long-standing issue of simultaneous dimensional and power supply scalability and hence, can lead to a paradigm shift in information technology as well as healthcare.",,,
263,Improving Efficiency of III-N Quantum Well Based Optoelectronic Devices through Active Region Design and Growth Techniques,"The III-Nitride materials system provides a fascinating platform for developing optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells and LEDs, which have the power to dramatically improve the efficiency of our power consumption and reduce our environmental footprint. Finding ways to make these devices more efficient is key to driving their widespread adoption. This dissertation focuses on the intersection of challenges in physics and metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) growth at the nanoscale when designing for device efficiency. In order to create the best possible InGaN solar cell, a multiple quantum well (MQW) active region design had to be employed to prevent strain relaxation related degradation. There were two competing challenges for MQW active region design and growth. First, it was observed current collection efficiency improved with thinner quantum barriers, which promoted efficient tunneling transport instead of inefficiency thermally activated escape. Second, GaN barriers could planarize surface defects in the MQW region under the right conditions and when grown thick enough. A two-step growth method for thinner quantum barriers was developed that simultaneously allowed for tunneling transport and planarized V-defects. Barriers as thin as 4 nm were employed in MQW active regions with up to 30 periods without structural or electrical degradation, leading to record performance. Application of dielectric optical coatings greatly reduced surface reflections and allowed a second pass of light through the device. This both demonstrated the feasibility of multijunction solar integration and boosted conversion efficiency to record levels for an InGaN solar cell. III-N LEDs have achieved state-of-the-art performance for decades, but still suffer from the phenomena of efficiency droop, where device efficiency drops dramatically at high power operation. Droop is exacerbated by the polarization-induced electric fields in InGaN quantum wells, which originate from a lack of inversion symmetry in GaN's wurtzite crystal structure. These fields can be screened by using highly doped layers, but the extreme dopant densities predicted by simulation for complete screening may require using Ge as an alternative n-type dopant to Si. GaN:Ge layers with excellent electrical characteristics were grown by MOCVD with doping densities exceeding 1020 cm -3. However, their surface morphologies were very poor and they proved a poor screening dopant in LED structures. Using Si as the n-type screening dopant, LEDs with single QW active regions were grown, packaged, and tested. Biased photoluminescence showed strong evidence of complete polarization screening. The LEDs had low droop, but also low peak efficiencies. Possible explanations for trends in efficiency with varying QW width and field screening will be discussed.",,,
264,Roads from War: Challenges to Afghanistan's Rural Infrastructural Development,"Rural access infrastructural development projects in post 2001 Afghanistan represent a vital component of the economic recovery of the state. This thesis examines four of the most prevalent of these projects implemented by the World Bank, and in doing so substantiates the significant challenges faced by both the international development aid community and domestic implementing agencies. These challenges not only impact the efficiency and outcomes of these rural access projects, but are also significantly observable across a broader set of infrastructural development and rehabilitation programs throughout Afghanistan. While these issues are certainly exacerbated by the austere operational climate of the region itself, referring to ongoing conflict, government capacity and legitimacy limitations, and economic instability, they should more accurately be understood as symptomatic of greater structural contradictions within contemporary ""development"" paradigms. The future success or failure of Afghanistan's economic recovery will depend on the international aid community's ability to aggressively reform its aid goals and success indicators, facilitate domestic institutional agency in establishing and realizing development goals, and definitively separating aid goals and operations from military ones.",,,
265,Managing ecosystem services in the face of uncertainty: what is the role of biodiversity?,"The conservation community is increasingly focused on managing nature explicitly for ecosystem services that provide benefits to humans, rather than for its intrinsic value. Though often debated, the consequences of conserving ecosystems for their services rather than for the explicit goal of biodiversity protection are not clear. While biodiversity can contribute to ecosystem services, this scientific link is fraught with uncertainty. How many and which species to protect is thus an important challenge for applied and theoretical environmental science, as well as new policy initiatives, such as the intergovernmental platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services (IPBES). My first chapter presents new theory to address the extent to which a goal of ecosystem service provision creates a significant economic incentive for biodiversity protection when facing uncertainty over how biodiversity produces services. I derive the level of biodiversity protection that maximizes ecosystem service provision under uncertainty and define a criterion that can be used to determine when managing for ecosystem services economically justifies broad-scale biodiversity protection. I illustrate the utility of this criterion, applying it to several ecosystem services across locations (pollination, wave attenuation, and carbon storage). Next my second chapter considers factors other than uncertainty that may increase alignment between management to obtain ecosystem services versus explicitly to conserve biodiversity. I find the objectives of conserving biodiversity and delivering ecosystem services align more frequently than would be predicted by considering only the known and direct contributions of abundant species to current ecosystem service provisioning. Specifically, I review existing literature on four factors that strengthen alignment, finding the following. First, the number of species that contribute significantly to services is much larger than many current estimates from observational studies. Second, coarse management actions to enhance ecosystem services, such as protecting a location or restoring a habitat type, can provide ""incidental"" conservation benefits at no additional cost. Third, managing for services should provide broader benefits to biodiversity by disproportionately protecting at-risk species if the species most at risk of local extirpation also contribute significantly to one or more services (i.e., rare or threatened species). Fourth, managing for even a single, relatively low value ecosystem service can have indirect benefits to biodiversity if the species that are significant to service provision have functional ecosystem roles that promote biodiversity (e.g., if they are habitat forming species or keystone predators). However, significant uncertainty remains, especially surrounding the service provisioning roles of the vast number of rare species in nearly every ecosystem. Finally, in my third chapter, I aim to reduce uncertainty about the role of biodiversity in the provision of a specific ecosystem service (fisheries yields) in variable climates. I develop theory to predict the consequences of within-year temperature variability for yields and explore the role diversity might play in offsetting potential impacts. I hypothesize that higher functional diversity (FD), measured with traits related to species' responses to temperature, can mitigate impacts from temperature variability on yields. Using a global marine fisheries dataset, I find that within-year temperature variability reduces yields but current FD of targeted species largely offsets this effect, avoiding annual losses of 8% on average globally relative to if FD were degraded to the lowest level observed in the data. All together, this dissertation contributes our understanding of when management strategies targeting ecosystem services versus biodiversity conservation align or when they do not. This knowledge is critical to new policies initiatives like IPBES with the dual of objective of protecting biodiversity and benefits nature provides people.",,,
266,Perceived knowledge and expectations: Essays on individual choice behavior,"This dissertation is composed of three Experimental papers on individual choice behavior. On the first I discuss decision making process within ambiguous settings and how ambiguity aversion and contrast effects can affect choice behavior. In this work two types of ambiguity are defined: ""Subjective Ambiguity"", where outcome probabilities are well defined but not known to the decision maker; and ""Intrinsic Ambiguity"", where decision maker's perception about outcome probabilities are subject to sudden changes. Using these two concepts separately, I performed an experiment to test how does the flow of one's own knowledge perception behaves. The results suggest distinct choice patterns for each ambiguity type. I find that intrinsic ambiguity tends to enhance recency bias. Also the distance between 2 events has a clear effect when the decisions involve subjectively ambiguous events, but not so if probabilities are uncertain. Finally, the existence of an intermediate event with a distinct bias from that of the baseline does not reduce the influence of that baseline over the individual's knowledge perception. On the second paper I present a laboratory experiment designed to shed light into the role of expectations on workers' reciprocal behavior when a cut in wages takes place. Previous literature has studied reciprocity without expectation formation, but if expectations enter individuals' loss-gain utility, they may affect perception and effort choices. Using fixed wages and productivity-dependent profits, I measure workers' responses to a cut in wages in situations where that cut was more expected, as well as when it was less expected. Results are consistent with the notion of reciprocity and also with the idea that expectations can influence workers' reciprocal behavior, so that workers effort varies less when wages were expected. Lastly, the third paper explores the effect of a movie trailer over the enjoyment of a short movie, using a lab experiment. The results show that the average enjoyment for was higher for the Control group than for the Treatment (Advertisement) group. In fact, on average, the difference between individuals' predicted and realized enjoyments (before and after watching the movie) was twice as much for the Control than for the Treatment group.",,,
267,"Nationalism in the New European Union: The Influence of Nationalism on the Salience of, and Party Attitudes Toward EU Political, Economic, and Social Policies","The formation of the European Union creates a political condition that requires political to parties consider two levels of political competition: domestic politics and EU-level politics. For most parties EU-level politics are a secondary concern for political parties. As a result, EU policies have received little attention in domestic political competition. However, with deepening European integration, EU-level politics have emerged as a potential issue in domestic political competition. As part of their efforts to win votes and seats, parties must decide whether to develop a position on EU-level politics, or to remain focused on their domestic political platform. While the salience of EU-level politics is low across most European states, its importance does vary from country to country. This dissertation project attempts to answer several questions concerning the relationship between EU-level politics and domestic political competition. First, how do debates about the European Union manifest in domestic politics? Second, how does nationalism influence how EU policies are discussed in domestic politics? In order to explore these questions this dissertation expands on our understanding of how fringe parties use nationalism to influence the salience of EU-level policies in domestic political competition. It argues that differences in nationalism influence the types of EU policies that fringe, anti-EU parties can argue as a threat to the national group in a way to increase their votes. In turn, the efforts of these fringe parties influence what EU policies become salient in domestic political competition and also influence the attitudes of political parties toward EU polices. In order to develop this argument this dissertation first develops a method for determining types of nationalism for EU states ranging from inclusionary civic nationalism to exclusionary ethnic nationalism. It then argues that considering the EU as multiple issue areas as opposed to a single issue allows for a stronger understanding of party positions toward EU-level policies. In order to determine the salience of EU policies for political parties as well as their attitudes toward those policies this project moves beyond party manifesto data by collecting party statements posted on official party webpages in campaign period before the 2014 European Parliamentary elections for parties in Sweden, Germany, Estonia, and Poland. It then codes the documents for any statements concerning EU political, economic, or social policies. The dissertation then uses a descriptive and statistical analysis at both the state-level and party-level of analysis in order to test the influence that different types of national have on variation in the salience of EU-level policies across Europe. The results demonstrate that nationalism does influence the discussion of EU-level politics in domestic political competition. They also support evidence that there is party cohesion among parties in European party families concerning party attitudes toward EU political, economic, and social policies.",,,
268,Stress drop and its Uncertainty for Earthquakes M3.8-5.5 in Central California and Oklahoma,"Stress drop is the stress that is effectively available to drive fault motion. It is a key parameter in predicting peak ground acceleration (PGA), since PGA, and it is very important in estimating ground motion. However, it is difficult to get an accurate estimation of stress drop. In order to get a more stable measurement of stress drop, we test two methods in this thesis: the first one is the Brune stress drop, which is more commonly applied, and the second one is the Arms stress drop, which less applied before and theoretically should have less uncertainty. By comparing these two methods we would like to test the feasibility and stability of the Arms method. We applied these two methods to data of earthquakes M3-5.5 in California and Oklahoma. We found that, taking Oklahoma results as an example, the mean value of Brune stress drop is 0.38 MPa, with a multiplicative uncertainty of 3.12, and the mean value of Arms stress drop is 1.04, with a multiplicative uncertainty of 1.79. Therefore we concluded that the Arms method is a good estimator of stress drop, with a smaller uncertainty. We determine the path attenuation so that we can increase the source-station distance of events studied to be as much as 76 km. The path seismic attenuation is a critical parameter that must be included in the analysis.",,,

Poised as it was at a crossroads between the aesthetic traditions of theater and cinema, avant-garde experimentation and socialist realism and, most significantly, silent and sound film, the youthful and enthusiastic FEKS negotiated a rapidly changing political landscape and the demands placed on Soviet artists by the state. This dissertation synthesizes elements of the previously fragmented, untranslated history and legacy of Eccentrism in the Soviet Union, in order to shed light on a poignant and informative example of media in transition across technological, national, and ideological barriers.",,,
271,Preserving entanglement during weak measurement demonstrated with a violation of the Bell-Leggett-Garg inequality,"Quantum mechanics makes many predictions, such as superposition, projective measurement, and entanglement, which defy classical intuition. For many years it remained unclear if these predictions were real physical phenomena, or the result of an incomplete understanding of hidden classical variables. For quantum entanglement, the Bell inequality provided the first experimental bound on such hidden variable theories by considering correlated measurements between spatially separated photons. Following a similar logic, the Leggett-Garg inequality provides an experimental test of projective measurement by correlating sequential measurements of the same object. More recently, these inequalities have become important benchmarks for the ""quantumness'' of novel systems, measurement techniques, or methods of generating entanglement. In this work we describe a continuous and controlled exchange of extracted state information and two-qubit entanglement collapse, demonstrated using the hybrid Bell-Leggett-Garg inequality. This effect is quantified by correlating weak measurement results with subsequent projective readout to collect all the statistics of a Bell inequality experiment in a single quantum circuit. This result was made possible by technological advances in superconducting quantum processors which allow precise control and measurement in multi-qubit systems. Additionally we discuss the central role of superconducting Josephson parametric amplifiers, which are a requirement for high fidelity single shot qubit readout. We demonstrate the ability to measure average Bell state information with minimal entanglement collapse, by violating this hybrid Bell-Leggett-Garg inequality at the weakest measurement strengths. This result indicates that it is possible to learn about the dynamics of large entangled systems without significantly affecting their evolution.",,,
272,Land Grab or Combating Poverty : The Case of ProSAVANA in Mozambique,"In 2009 the governments of Brazil, Japan, and Mozambique agreed to launch a long-term agricultural development program along the Nacala Corridor in Northern Mozambique. The aim of the program known as ProSAVANA is to replicate the successes of the transformation which took place in the Cerrado region of Brazil beginning in the 1970s, helping that country to become a major global producer of several agricultural commodities. The governments in charge of the program have promised poverty alleviation and food security for Mozambican farmers through investment in agricultural research and extension services, increased land tenure security, improved irrigation, roads, and storage facilities, and greater access to modern inputs and markets through contract agriculture. However, since its early stages the program has faced intense opposition from small-scale farmers, peasant organizations, and national and international NGOs. There is great fear that the program will result in massive land expropriation benefiting corrupt politicians and foreign companies at the expense of the families farming in the region. These groups point to the massive concentration of land ownership and the environmental destruction that accompanied the transformation to large-scale mechanized agriculture in the Brazilian Cerrado. They also cite the large number of land conflicts in recent years between local small-scale farmers and foreign investors granted land concessions by the government. The large majority of Northern Mozambique's population practices rain-fed subsistence agriculture with little or no access to chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or improved seed varieties. More than 40 percent of farmers fail to produce enough crops to feed themselves for the entire year. Very few people in the region have land title and thus are in a precarious position. There is little doubt that increased investment in the region could contribute to higher crop yields and greater food production. However, it is also possible that more investment may also lead to an increase in the number of land conflicts and expropriation of peasant lands. In my thesis I will trace out the development of ProSAVANA and analyze some of the historical circumstances that may have contributed to the strong negative reaction against the program. I will review the Mozambican land tenure system and threats to the land tenure security of Mozambican peasants. I will look at the ways in which the opposition to ProSAVANA has led to changes in the rhetoric used in program documents, and possible changes to the priorities of the program itself. Finally, I will ask under what conditions the program may gain the acceptance of the peasant population and be considered a success.",,,
273,"'The Country in Our Minds' : Diasporic Longing, Ethnic Solidarity and Political Consciousness within the Haitian Transnational Community","This study examines the lived realities of Haitian Americans residing in Miami, Florida. By drawing on theories of global capitalism, migration, transnationalism, and diaspora it explores how the experience of Haitian migrants living in the Miami community of Little Haiti offer insights as to whether transnational, diasporic communities are uniquely placed to become socially aware and political active within their diasporic communities . Most studies on Haitians in the United States focus on New York. However, those residing in the global city of Miami are a unique population of mostly working-class Haitians who, marginalized by U.S. politicians, the media, and migrant groups in Florida, are rendered precarious. Such experiences can push Haitian migrants to maintain transnational links and form diasporic communities in areas such as the ethnic enclave of Little Haiti. Through participant observation and semi-structured interviews with Haitian volunteers and employees at the Little Haiti Community Support Center (LHCSC), in July 2014 I explored the lived experiences of politically engaged Haitian migrants residing in this diasporic community. From the interviews emerged a hybrid, at times ambivalent, diasporic political and cultural consciousness maintained through transnational forms of solidarity. Political consciousness developed in community and in strategic collaborations with other Black diasporic groups. Cultural consciousness functioned as a tool of empowerment and a medium for critiques of U.S. policies, aspects of Haitian culture, and gender norms. Activism solidified communities and families and cultivated new practices to pass on to the next generation. Using the LHCSC as an example of a transnational, politically active site of community, this paper explores how an ethnic community becomes unified as diaspora, and more socially and globally aware as a consequence of their migrant experience.",,,
274,Synchronization in Pulse-Coupled Oscillator With Delays and Mixed Excitatory/Inhibitory Coupling,"Pulse coupled oscillator (PCO) networks consist of oscillators that send pulses to their in-neighbors on the network, as defined by the sensing digraph. The neighbors update their phase when they receive the pulse, depending on their current phase and the pulse strength. This mechanism causes the oscillators to synchronize for some values of their initial phases, and to converge to an asynchronous state with a fixed phase difference for other values of their initial phases. The synchronizing behavior due to pulse coupling has been observed in nature: fireflies tend to flash in unison, and neurons and cardiac cells synchronize their firing with their neighboring cells by this mechanism. There has been recent interest in developing algorithms based on PCO networks to synchronize the clocks for distributed sensing and robotic applications. PCO networks whose sensing digraphs are strongly connected have been modeled extensively, in the presence and absence of delays in the transmissions of pulses, using analytical and numerical approaches. We model a PCO network whose sensing digraph is not necessarily strongly connected but satisfies the weaker condition of having a globally reachable node. We propose a simple model of PCO networks with identical frequencies, based on the approach used in the study of distributed consensus. We model the discrete dynamics of the network as a linear time-varying (LTV) system. We use the row-stochastic property of the weighted adjacency matrices that characterize the LTV system, to derive sufficient conditions for synchrony. Arbitrary delays in the pulse-transmission are modeled as disturbances. Synchrony may not be reached exactly in the presence of delays, and error that remains in the phases in the steady state is proportional to the maximum delay. Further, we observe the convergence to be exponential if sampled over a sufficiently large number of receptions, and estimate the rate of convergence based on the properties of the digraph. We also estimate the basin of attraction of the synchronized solution. We illustrate these results with numerical examples.",,,
275,Placing Memory : Postdictatorial Documentaries in the Southern Cone,"My dissertation, Placing Memory: Postdictatorial Documentaries in the Southern Cone, examines recent films from Argentina and Chile that take up the dictatorships of the 1970s and '80s in each country. I argue that these documentaries provide a new vantage point from which to consider how spaces in the postdictatorial landscape are mediated, shaped, and reshaped in memory over time, remolded to the demands of each successive generation. I begin by considering the politics of these recent documentaries in relation with the more militant films of the New Latin American Cinema of the '60s and '70s. This chapter also includes consideration of the different relationships to memory of those who experienced the dictatorship as adults, and the postmemory generation, or those who were children during, or were born after the dictatorship. In the two chapters that follow, I consider films that employ sites with memorial significance: first, official memorial sites, with wide recognition and significance, and second, sites that resonate within individual or smaller-scale memories, whether that of the filmmaker or their subjects. I read these sites through the films and through my own site visits in order to elucidate the ways in which the films alter the experience of the sites, or function as memorials in their own right. Finally, I examine the networks of distribution and sites of exhibition for these films, including museums that exhibit documentary clips, screenings at memory sites and at schools, and documentary representations of the space of exhibition in a memorial context.",,,
276,"A Reconstruction of Proto-Sogeram Phonology, Lexicon, and Morphosyntax","The Sogeram languages are a family of ten languages spoken in central Madang Province, Papua New Guinea. This dissertation presents a reconstruction of Proto-Sogeram, including sections on its phonology, lexicon, verbal morphology, nominal morphology, and syntax. The methodology employed is, for the most part, the traditional comparative method, especially in the sections focusing on phonology, lexicon, and morphology. But I also argue for methodological innovations to the comparative method, which are grounded in a theoretical understanding of the nature of language and language change. These innovations allow for the reconstruction of syntax, and I reconstruct a good deal of the grammar of Proto-Sogeram. I also discuss many of the various innovations that the Sogeram languages have undergone, and conclude with a grammar sketch of Proto-Sogeram as I reconstruct it. The dissertation also contains six appendices, each of which is a grammar sketch of a previously undescribed Sogeram language. (Appendix 4 is actually a description of the two closely related Aisi languages.) These are the result of my fieldwork in Madang Province. The data from that fieldwork, along with data from other linguists on the three other Sogeram languages, constitutes the synchronic material on which the reconstruction is based.",,,
277,Improving Health with Science : Exploring Community-Driven Science Education in Kenya,"This study examines the role of place-based science education in fostering student-driven health interventions. While literature shows the need to connect science with students' place and community, there is limited understanding of strategies for doing so. Making such connections is important for underrepresented students who tend to perceive learning science in school as disconnected to their experiences out of school (Aikenhead, Calabrese-Barton, & Chinn, 2006). To better understand how students can learn to connect place and community with science and engineering practices in a village in Kenya, I worked with community leaders, teachers, and students to develop and study an education program (a school-based health club) with the goal of improving knowledge of health and sanitation in a Kenyan village. While students selected the health topics and problems they hoped to address through participating in the club, the topics were taught with a focus on providing opportunities for students to learn the practices of science and health applications of these practices. Students learned chemistry, physics, environmental science, and engineering to help them address the health problems they had identified in their community. Surveys, student artifacts, ethnographic field notes, and interview data from six months of field research were used to examine the following questions: (1) In what ways were learning opportunities planned for using science and engineering practices to improve community health? (2) In what ways did students apply science and engineering practices and knowledge learned from the health club in their school, homes, and community? and (3) What factors seemed to influence whether students applied or intended to apply what they learned in the health club? Drawing on place-based science education theory and community-engagement models of health, process and structural coding (Saldana, 2013) were used to determine patterns in students' applications of their learning. Students applied learning across health topics they identified as interesting and relevant to their community: hand-washing, disease-prevention, first aid, balanced diet, and water. Students' application of their learning was influenced by internal, external, and relational factors with the community, science education factors, and cultural factors. Some factors, which may have been barriers for students to apply their learning, were turned into supports via bridging strategies used by the students and teacher. Bridging strategies allowed students to connect between their place and science in meaningful ways in the classroom. These strategies were critical in bringing students' place into the classroom and enabling students to apply their learning toward place. The model resulting from the identified factors informed existing models for sociocultural considerations in community-based health interventions. The community-engagement applied practices of science (CAPS) model serves to conceptualize findings in this study and informs an integrated method for using community-engagement education as a stimuli for students to become cultural brokers and improve community health. In addition to focusing on teaching practices of science and encouraging students to apply their learning, this research suggests that bridging strategies can be used to connect science with a students' place in meaningful ways that serve both students and their local communities.",,,
278,The Dynamics of Attention : Agenda Setting in the Modern Media Environment,"The media environment has changed dramatically in recent years. First altered by cable news, which upended the dominance of network news, digital media has in recent years created a media landscape littered with media outlets, from new, ambitious websites like Politico to citizen media sourced on Twitter. It is unclear how or if these changes have changed the relationship between the media and the public; indeed, despite considerable attention from scholars, the interdependencies between media elements such as professional news, blogs, social media, and the public that define the modern media have yet to be unraveled. Instead, several conflicting findings have emerged: some confirm the prevailing media to public agenda setting theory, others find a reverse agenda setting dynamic, while some uncover an interactive series of processes in which diverse elements influence the media and public agendas. I argue that modern agenda setting processes reflect a hybridized media ecosystem, with mutual interdependencies and feedback loops driving agenda creation. I further characterize the issues that are likely to emerge in particular elements and consider the role of partisanship. To test my hypotheses, I analyze longitudinal data on issue attention across five elements of the contemporary media system: survey data, Twitter, key blogs, a record of Google searches within the United States; and top professional news sources. I track attention to 25 issues across a time horizon from January 2010 through December 2013. A lagged time series analysis further identifies issue origin points and trends as issues travel across elements. In order to further illuminate this relationship, I examine three of these issues in more detail by shining a light on the media and public discussions of these issues during periods of canonical attention. I also show how the rise of partisan media has changed the media agenda itself, with the result that different outlets attend to issues at different rates. This dissertation is therefore able to characterize the interdependencies inherent within the system that drive the public and media agendas, challenging some of the assumptions of a generation of minimal effects theories.",,,
279,"The Iroquois Century : Kinship Politics, Borderlands Violence, and the Origins of the Colonial Northeast, 1600-1701","In The Iroquois Century: kinship politics, borderlands violence, and the origins of the colonial Northeast, 1600-1701, I, Jackson Bergman Warkentin, combine analysis of captivity practices, Native diplomatic rituals, and Haudenosaunee folklore and oral histories to show how the Iroquois Five Nations built internal political cohesion through externally directed violence in the seventeenth century. Peaking in the 1650s-60s, the Five Nations overwhelmed their Indian enemies and transformed the political landscape of the Northeast. My study breaks with traditional interpretations that frame these seventeenth-century ""Beaver Wars"" as a reaction to European settlement, trade, and disease. Instead, I look at how violence and control of enemy bodies enhanced the power of the Iroquois, both individual clans as well as the Iroquois League as a whole, within the unique structure of their kinship-based political system. I argue that pre-contact rivalries between Native groups and the unifying power of warfare and captivity practices within the Five Nations drove borderlands violence in the Northeast throughout the seventeenth century.",,,
280,Essays on Human and Social Capital Accumulation,"This dissertation consists of three essays in applied microeconomics that address topics of human and social capital accumulation. The first essay addresses the topic of women and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math.) Women are substantially less likely than men to graduate college with a STEM degree. This paper investigates whether class composition can help explain why women are disproportionately more likely to fall out of the STEM ""pipeline''. Identification comes from a standardized enrollment process at a large public university that randomly assigns freshmen to different mandatory introductory chemistry lectures. Using administrative data, I find that women who are enrolled in a class with higher ability peers are less likely to graduate with a STEM degree, while men's persistence in STEM is unaffected by class composition. I also show that the decline for women is most pronounced for those in the bottom third of the ability distribution. I rule out the possibility that this is driven solely by grades because both men and women receive higher grades in classes with higher ability peers. Overall, these results suggest that class composition as an important factor in determining STEM persistence for women and provide a novel explanation for part of the STEM gender gap in post-secondary education. The second essay, co-authored with Daniel Argyle, examines the effect of the four-day school week in rural Colorado on juvenile crimes. Four-day school weeks are becoming more common nationwide especially in rural areas. Those affected by the policy spend the same number of hours in school each week as students on a typical five-day week, however the four-day week schedule essentially reallocates unstructured time into larger blocks creating a three-day weekend every weekend, since treated students for the most part have Fridays off. Our difference-in-difference estimates for rural Colorado indicate that switching all students in a county from a five-day week to a four-day week increases juvenile arrests for property crimes, in particular larceny, by about 80%. In the third essay, co-authored with Christiana Stoddard, we study the academic achievement of American Indians. The academic achievement of American Indians has not been extensively studied. Using NAEP supplements, we find that the average achievement relative to white students resembles other disadvantaged groups. However, there are several differences. Family characteristics explain two times as much of the raw gap as for blacks. School factors also account for a larger portion of the gap than for blacks or Hispanics. The distribution is also strikingly different: low performing American Indian students have a substantially larger gap than high performing students. Finally, racial self-identification is more strongly related to achievement, especially as American Indian students age.",,,
281,A Historical and Performance Companion to the Art Song of the 16th Century Spanish Vihuelistas With Texts and Translations,"The purpose of this document is to provide guidance in the repertoire and performance practice of the art songs of the 16th century Spanish vihuela composers. The document begins with historical information on the music, discussing its specific genres, tablature, and origins. Further, three composers, Luis Milan (1500-1561), Luys de Narvaez (fl. 1526-1549), and Alonso Mudarra (1508-1580), are discussed in detail. This study examines and offers insight into their lives and musical style. Eventually, my work in this area will expand to include the seven major vihuela composers. In later chapters, issues of performance practice are discussed, such as ornamentation, voice type, diction of early Spanish, and choice of instrument. Because so little has been written about this music in comparison to other genres of accompanied solo song, research posed no small challenge. The writings of John Ward and John Griffiths have been especially helpful. Both of these scholars have devoted their lives to this music and remain among the most respected experSts in the field. Their writings extensively informed this study. A unique part of our investigation is a section on the guitarist-singer collaboration. While there are many books dedicated to the pianist-singer collaboration, none familiar to me have been written on the collaboration between guitarist and singer. My own expertise as a performer served as the chief source of information. This section guides people in making the collaboration as effective as possible. Finally, as resource material, this study includes song texts and translations for compositions of the three composers discussed in detail.",,,
282,Places of Rest : Modernism and Environmental Recovery,"Places of Rest outlines a modernist aesthetic of slowness, immediacy and introspection in relation to a cultural history of nature protection in the United Kingdom. It draws on the archives of the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves, founded in 1912, which invoked a threatening rhetoric of Nature's total exhaustion under the march of modern development. Literary modernism's presentation of human fragility amidst exhausted environments challenged problematic industrial and imperial narratives of unlimited progress and generated new modes of ecological awareness in the 20th century. Faced with the restless and inescapable forces of modernization, modernist writers shifted away from the withdrawn, ""restful contemplation"" of the Romantics and moved towards an increasingly materialist attention to the world as an immersive stream of human and nonhuman connections that are interdependent and hierarchical in problematic ways. The Anglophone novel, as it develops through D. H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Djuna Barnes, Jean Rhys and Chinua Achebe, becomes increasingly attuned to constructions of personal, social and planetary identity in relation to environmental exploitation. Highlighting the physical limitations that deny autonomy to human life, these writers communicate the unsustainability of relentless modernization and foreground the importance of recovery for communal wellbeing.",,,
283,Curing A Sick Nation : Public Health and Citizenship in Colombia 1930-1940,"This dissertation analyzes public health programs and the reform narratives doctors and state officials produced from 1930 to 1940, along with residents' petitions sent to Cali's municipal council during the same period. Some of the central questions it strives to answer are: what were Liberal reformers striving to do when they set out to implement social programs in public health and sanitation at this time? How did these programs and the public narratives they produced help alter state-society relations in Colombia? And finally, how did local communities use these programs to negotiate with state officials and gain access to the benefits of full social citizenship? In answering these questions, I argue that Liberal reformers used public health, hygiene, and the organization of space as tools to modernize the nation, redefine the state's responsibility to its citizens, and modify or regulate people's everyday habits, customs, and private lives. Teaching workers and peasants how to create habits that promoted their physical wellbeing and allowed them to contribute to national prosperity through their labor and their productive capacities. Liberal reformers argued that the expansion of public health services and implementation of hygiene campaigns were ideal mechanisms to help the state lead the masses in this transformation. As the Liberal party, in power from 1930 to 1946, set out to implement public health programs designed to modernize the nation, foster economic prosperity, and improve the health of its citizens, government officials and the groups these reform efforts targeted sought to define what citizenship, modernity, health, and progress meant for them. Reform narratives provide just one angle to this story. While reformers portrayed workers and peasants at best as passive victims of more than four decades of state neglect at the hands of Conservative regimes, or at worst as stubborn, backward, ignorant, and unruly subjects---the ways local communities responded to state reform efforts complicates this seemingly simple dichotomy. While reformers promoted a brand of modernity that relied on science, education, and state intervention to diagnose, treat, and cure their society, the petitions local residents sent to their council and other municipal officer show that these actors both adopted and challenged the state's official rhetoric. Municipal records show that communities drew from public narratives and reform language to claim their rights, and gain access to the benefits of inclusion into the social body. While some petitioners used current understandings of hygiene, sanitation, modernity, progress, party loyalty, or citizenship to claim their rights and hold local authorities' accountable for solving their grievances, others proposed alternative definitions of these notions. At a time, when the Liberal party continuously emphasized its commitment to extending state power and responsibility in guaranteeing its citizens access to health, sanitation, education, and other social benefits, petitioners' use of a language that resonated with and challenged these public narratives, shows that negotiation is an essential part of state-society relations, and the limits of reform efforts once they are implemented on-the-ground. In their petitions, local residents turned blame away from themselves, and turned it towards the local state, which they argued was ultimately responsible for failing them. This act showed both the state's inability to extend social guarantees to all its citizens, and contradictions in the state's democratizing efforts.",,,
284,Tractable Quantification of Metastability for Robust Bipedal Locomotion,"This work develops tools to quantify and optimize performance metrics for bipedal walking, toward enabling improved practical and autonomous operation of two-legged robots in real-world environments. While speed and energy efficiency of legged locomotion are both useful and straightforward to quantify, measuring robustness is arguably more challenging and at least as critical for obtaining practical autonomy in variable or otherwise uncertain environmental conditions, including rough terrain. The intuitive and meaningful robustness quantification adopted in this thesis begins by stochastic modeling of disturbances such as terrain variations, and conservatively defining what a failure is, for example falling down, slippage, scuffing, stance foot rotation, or a combination of such events. After discretizing the disturbance and state sets by meshing, step-to-step dynamics are studied to treat the system as a Markov chain. Then, failure rates can be easily quantified by calculating the expected number of steps before failure. Once robustness is measured, other performance metrics can also be easily incorporated into the cost function for optimization. For high performance and autonomous operation under variations, we adopt a capacious framework, exploiting a hierarchical control structure. The low-level controllers, which use only proprioceptive (internal state) information, are optimized by a derivative-free method without any constraints. For practicability of this process, developing an algorithm for fast and accurate computation of our robustness metric was a crucial and necessary step. While the outcome of optimization depends on capabilities of the controller scheme employed, the convenient and time-invariant parameterization presented in this thesis ensures accommodating large terrain variations. In addition, given environment estimation and state information, the high-level control is a behavioral policy to choose the right low-level controller at each step. In this thesis, optimal switching policies are determined by applying dynamic programming tools on Markov decision processes obtained through discretization. For desirable performance in practice from policies that are formed using meshing-based approximation to the true dynamics, robustness of high-level control to environment estimation and discretization errors are ensured by modeling stochastic noise in the terrain information and belief state while solving for behavioral policies.",,,
285,Reachability and Real-Time Actuation Strategies for the Active SLIP Model,"Running and hopping follow similar patterns for different animals, independent of the number of legs employed. An aerial phase alternates with a ground contact phase, during which the center of mass moves as if a spring were compressed and then extended to recover stored elastic energy. Hence, consisting of a point mass mounted on a massless spring leg, the Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) is a prevalent model for analyzing running and hopping. In this work we consider an actuated version of the SLIP model, with a series elastic actuator added to the leg, serving the purposes of adding/removing energy to/from the system and of modifying dynamics during stance, toward achieving non-steady locomotion on varying terrain. While the SLIP model has been a topic of research in legged locomotion for several decades, studies on the effect of actuation on the system's behavior are still not complete. The goal of this thesis is to explore how a series elastic actuator applied to the SLIP model's leg can change the system's dynamics. This, in turn, enables a variety of long-term planning strategies for using limited footholds and design non-steady gaits while simultaneously recovering from unexpected perturbations, both sensorial and due to a limited knowledge of the terrain profile. We principally investigate how, through actuation, we can solve partially or completely the system's equations of motion, to enforce a desired trajectory and reach a desired state. We also determine the reachable state space of the model using several different actuation strategies, investigating the variation of the reachable set with respect to particular actuator motions and providing relationships between local actuator displacements throughout stance and location of the reached apex state. We then propose a control strategy based on graphical and numerical studies of the reachability space to drive the system to a desired state, with the ability to reduce the effects of sensing errors and disturbances happening at landing as well as during ground contact.",,,
286,The Effects of Interface Design and Spatial Ability on Virtual Molecule Manipulation Performance,"Virtual models are increasingly employed in STEM education to foster learning about spatial phenomena. However, the role of user interface design and spatial ability in moderating learning and performance with virtual models are not yet well understood. In order to examine the effects of virtual interface design and spatial ability, two experiments were conducted in which participants solved spatial organic chemistry problems using a virtual model system. Two aspects of the virtual model interface were manipulated: display dimensionality (3D stereo vs. mono) and the location of the hand-held device used to manipulate the virtual molecules (colocated with visual cues vs. displaced). The experimental task required participants to interpret and manipulate the spatial structure of organic molecules in order to align various orientations and configurations depicted by diagrams in Experiment 1 and three-dimensional representations in Experiment 2. Individual differences were measured by two spatial ability tests and performance metrics included solution time and accuracy. Colocating the interaction device with the virtual image led to improved performance in both experiments and providing stereo viewing cues led to improved performance in Experiment 2. Individual differences analysis revealed that the effect of colocation on performance was moderated by spatial ability in Experiment 1, and the effect of providing stereo viewing was moderated by spatial ability in Experiment 2. The results were in line with the ability-as-compensator hypothesis: participants with lower ability uniquely benefited from the treatment, while those with higher ability were not affected by stereo or colocation. The findings of this work contribute to the aptitude-treatment-interaction literature and demonstrate a case of increased perceptual fidelity in a virtual model system differentially benefiting individuals with low spatial ability.",,,
287,Not That Kind of Adult Toy : A Post-Adolescent Predilection for Plastic Playthings,"This project is an exploratory study of the practice of toy collecting by adults. It examines the way they conceptualize their use of toys, what attracts them to these objects, the organization of communities of toy collectors, how they use the toys, and ultimately, what the toys provide for them. Using first-hand accounts collected at two pop culture conventions, information gathered from fan websites, respondent accounts featured in several recent documentaries, and panel presentations at three separate conventions, this study seeks to complicate the expectations of who toy consumers are (they're not just children), as well as demonstrate the way these fans combine both adult and childlike aspects of play into their activities. While the conception of the adult toy enthusiast is taking hold in popular culture, adult toy fans must still contest with a characterization of their hobby as odd and immature. To combat this tension and provide rationalization for their interest, toy enthusiasts employ a number of strategies involving the use of legitimizing language and activities. Ultimately, the following demonstrates that adult and child toy play do not encompass discrete categories, rather existing on a continuum of play throughout the life course.",,,
288,"Modeling Dense Granular Flow: A Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics Approach and Implications of Grain Fragmentation, Acoustic Effects and Interparticle Friction on Dynamic Friction","Granular flow rheology has broad implications on earth science and industrial processing of raw materials. This dissertation is an overview of our effort to understand dense granular flow and the influence of microscopic, grain-scale processes on dynamic friction from basic principles of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. First, I will provide a short introduction to the Shear-Transformation-Zone (STZ) theory of plastic deformation and the underlying theoretical framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, and use the Haxton-Liu hard-sphere simulations as a testing ground for the theory. Next, I will briefly discuss grain fragmentation and examine its implication on shear weakening and shear localization; in so doing, we account for the formation and persistence of shear bands of fragmented particles. Finally, I propose a way to incorporate acoustic effects, particle angularity, and interparticle friction into the STZ model. We show good agreement with laboratory experiments on angular sand particles that indicate shear-induced acoustic compaction at intermediate strain rates. We show in addition that friction between particles is essential in producing stick-slip instabilities, which can be controlled by the confining pressure and external vibrations.",,,
289,The Literacy Learning Experiences of Egyptian Students at the American University in Cairo: At the Intersection of Transnational Dimensionality and Intranational Flow in Literacy Studies,"This study examines the experiences of five Egyptian undergraduate students at the American University in Cairo (AUC) from different educational, class and geographic backgrounds. This study finds that students from public schooling and lower socioeconomic backgrounds arrive at AUC with significant language, literacy and social deficits compared to counterparts from private schooling and high socioeconomic backgrounds. The study considers how participants, based on the backgrounds, become involved with transnational literacy practices in university writing assignments. The study draws upon scholarship in transnational literacy studies, to inflect how New Literacy Studies considers global and local literacies with concepts of capital and positionality drawn from Pierre Bourdieu. The study conceptualizes student educational and class backgrounds as forms of cultural and social capital which, when deployed at AUC, result in differing participant positionality along educational and class lines. Although this distribution creates challenges for students from public schooling backgrounds, the study also finds that a student from a public schooling background exhibited unusually adaptive qualities, resulting in novel approaches to completing a complex literacy task. The study concludes by arguing that transnational literacy studies be extended to account for intranational movements within uniquely configured embedded, hybrid and permeable transnational spaces that serve local interests.",,,
290,A Process and Outcomes Evaluation of a Special Education Program for Students with Emotional Disturbance: The TIERS System,"Students with Emotional Disturbance require an array of support at schools, including but not limited to proactive classroom management techniques, specialized academic instruction, motivation systems, frequent goal setting and monitoring, mentor- based supports, school-home collaborative efforts, and psychotherapeutic services. While research has highlighted the importance of these components, many programs serving students with Emotional Disturbance do not consistently implement these evidence-based practices. The present study is an exploratory analysis of the implementation and outcomes of Tiers of Intensive Educationally Responsive Services (TIERS), a comprehensive program consisting of several evidence-based practices to promote social-emotional growth in students with Emotional and/or Behavioral Disturbance (EBD). The purpose of the study was to examine 1) whether the TIERS package of interventions resulted in significant increases in student transitions to the least restrictive environment from baseline, and whether significant differences existed between programs on this basis of implementation fidelity, 2) the impact of TIERS interventions on the severity of problem behaviors in students in three selected high school classrooms, 3) the impact of the TIERS model on the teacher ratings of treatment acceptability, and 4) whether or not a significant correlation exists between teacher treatment acceptability and the degree of implementation fidelity. The results of the study suggested that 1) there was a significant increase in the number of student transitions from baseline, though significant differences were not found on the basis of implementation fidelity, 2) single-case data demonstrated significant positive behavior growth among 24 high school students, 3) teachers' attitudes toward implementation were significantly improved from baseline, and 4) there was a statistically significant moderate positive correlation between treatment acceptability and implementation fidelity. Implications for future research in the areas of school-based programming for students with emotional disturbance and implementation science are discussed.",,,
291,The Life Cycle Energy-Water Usage Efficiency of Artificial Groundwater Recharge Via the Reuse of Treated Wastewater,"This dissertation investigates the dynamic energy-water usage efficiency of civil engineering projects involving the recharge of subsurface groundwater aquifers via the reuse of treated municipal wastewater. For this purpose a three-component integrated assessment model has been developed. The first component uses a cartographic modeling technique known as Weighted Overlay Analysis (WOA) to determine the location and extent of sites that are suitable for the development of groundwater recharge basins given a regional geographic context. The second component uses a novel Genetic Algorithm (GA) to address the multi-objective spatial optimization problem associated with locating corridors for the support infrastructure required to physically transport water from the treatment facility to the recharge site. The third and final component takes data about the anticipated recharge treatment source location, reuse destination location, and proposed infrastructure corridor location and uses them to populate a spatially explicit Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) model capturing all of the process energy consumption associated with the reuse system. Five case studies involving the planning of new basin scale artificial recharge systems within the state of California are presented and discussed.",,,
293,A change-point problem and preliminary test estimation in circular statistics,"This thesis investigates two different problems relating to circular data. One relates to change-point problems. Tests in this context are meant to detect the point in time at which a sample of observations changes the probability distribution from which they came. Suppose one has a set of independent vectors of measurements, observed in a time-ordered or space-ordered sequence. In our set-up, these observations are circular data and we are interested as to which point in time does the distribution change from having one mode to having more than one mode. In this work we model unimodality or bimodality with a mixture of two Circular Normal distributions, which admits both possibilities, albeit for different parameter values. Tests for detecting the change-point are derived using the generalized likelihood ratio method. We obtain simulated distri- butions and critical values for the appropriate test statistics in finite samples, as well as provide the asymptotic distributions, under some regularity conditions. We also tackle this problem from a Bayesian perspective. In the second part, the goal is to estimate the concentration parameter of a Circular Normal distribution when the mean direction is unknown. We present two alternate approaches that incorporate prior knowledge on the mean direction (i) via a preliminary test on the mean direction, the so-called ""preliminary test estimators"" and (ii) through an assumed prior distribution on the mean direction as one does in Bayes procedures. We compare such alternate estimators with the standard maximum likelihood estimator and explore when one method is superior to the other.",,,
294,Effects of Observing the Instructor Draw Diagrams on Learning from Multimedia Lessons,"This research tested whether viewing an instructor draw diagrams improves learning from multimedia lessons compared to viewing equivalent static (e.g., already-drawn) diagrams. In a series of five experiments, participants viewed a short video-based lesson about how the Doppler effect works. Some students viewed already-drawn diagrams while listening to a concurrent oral explanation (control group), whereas other students listened to the same explanation while viewing the instructor actually draw the diagrams by hand (draw group). All students then completed retention and transfer tests on the material. Results of Experiment 1 indicated that watching the instructor draw diagrams (by viewing the instructor's full body) resulted in significantly better transfer test performance than viewing already-drawn diagrams for learners with low prior knowledge (d = 0.58), but not for learners with high prior knowledge (d = -0.24). In Experiment 2, participants who watched the instructor draw diagrams (by only viewing the instructor's hand) significantly outperformed the control group on the transfer test, regardless of prior knowledge (d = 0.35). In Experiment 3, participants who watched diagrams being drawn but without actually viewing the instructor's hand did not significantly outperform the control group on the transfer test (d = -0.16). In Experiment 4, participants who observed the instructor draw diagrams with only the instructor's hand visible significantly outperformed those who observed the instructor draw diagrams with the instructor's body visible (d = 0.36). Finally, in Experiment 5, participants who viewed computer-based diagrams animated to match the act of drawing did not significantly outperform the control group (who viewed static computer-based diagrams) on the transfer test (d = 0.33). Overall, this research suggests that observing the instructor draw diagrams may promote learning in part because it takes advantage of basic principles of multimedia learning (such as signaling, segmenting, and temporal contiguity), but also because the presence of the instructor's hand during drawing may provide an important social cue that motivates learners to make sense of the material.",,,
296,Management of data and collaboration for business processes,"A business process (BP) is a collection of activities and services assembled together to accomplish a business goal. Business process management (BPM) refers to the management and support for a collection of inter-related business processes, which has been playing an essential role in all enterprises. Business practitioners today face enormous difficulties in managing data for BPs due to the fact that the data for BP execution is scattered across databases for enterprise, auxiliary data stores managed by the BPM systems, and even file systems (e.g., definition of BP models). Moreover, current data and business process modeling approaches leave associations of persistent data in databases and data in BPs to the implementation level with little abstraction. Implementing business logic involves data access from and to database often demands high development efforts. In the current study, we conceptualize the data used in BPs by capturing all needed information for a BP throughout its execution into a ""universal artifact"". The conceptualization provides a foundation for the separation of BP execution and BP data. With the new framework, the data analysis can be carried out without knowing the logic of BPs and the modification of the BP logics can be directly applied without understanding the data structure. Even though universal artifacts provide convenient data access for processes, the data is yet stored in the underlying database and the relationship between data in artifacts and the one in database is still undefined. In general, a way to link the data of these two data sources is needed. we propose a data mapping language aiming to bridge BP data and enterprise database, so that the BP designers only need to focus on business data instead of how to manipulate data by accessing the database. We formulate syntactic conditions upon specified mapping in order that updates upon database or BP data can be properly propagated. In database area, mapping database to a view has been widely studied In recently years, data exchange method extends the notion of database views to a target database (i.e., multiple views) by using a set of conjunctive queries called ""tuple generating dependency"" (tgd). Tgd is a language that is easy to understand/specify, expressive, and decidable for a wide range of properties, which is ideal as a mapping language. Naturally, if both enterprise database and artifacts are represented as relational database, we can take advantage of data exchange technology to bridge enterprise database and artifacts by using tgd as well. Therefore, we re-visit the mapping and update propagation problem under the relational setting. In addition to the data management for a single BP, it is equivalently essential to understand how messages and data should be exchanged among multiple collaborative BPs. With the introduction of artifacts, data is explicitly modeled that can be used in a collaborative setting. Unfortunately, today's BP collaboration languages (either orchestration or choreography) do not emphasize on how data is evolved during execution. Moreover, the existing languages always assume each participant type has a single participant instance. Therefore, a declarative language is introduced to specify the collaboration among BPs with data and multiple instances concerned. The language adopts a subset of linear temporal logics (LTL) as constraints to restrict the behavior of the collaborative BPs. As a follow-up study, we focus on the satisfiability problem of the declarative BP collaboration language, i.e., whether a given specification as a set of constraints allows at least one finite execution. Naturally, if a specification excludes every possible execution, it should be considered as an undesirable design. Therefore, we consider different combination of the constraint types and for each combination, syntactic conditions are provided to decide whether the given constraints are satisfiable. The syntactic conditions automatically lead to polynomial testing methods (comparing to PSPACE-complete complexity of general LTL satisfiability testing).",,,
297,Heat Flows and Entanglement Entropy: Insights From and Into AdS/CFT,"This dissertation will focus on exploring the AdS/CFT correspondence, both as a tool to probe the behavior of strongly coupled conformal field theories (CFTs) and as a fundamental duality to help us understand the holographic connection between quantum gravity and gauge theories. We will begin with an overview of this (two-part) dissertation, followed by an introduction to gravity in asymptotically locally AdS spacetimes. In the first part of the dissertation, we will then discuss the use of AdS/CFT as a tool to probe the dynamics of heat transport in strongly coupled CFTs. We will begin with a simple case in three bulk spacetime dimensions, and then construct a four-dimensional black hole solution which is dual to heat flow in a three-dimensional CFT. This black hole solution is stationary, but its horizon is not a Killing horizon, making it an interesting gravitational solution in its own right. We will then construct the gravitational dual to a CFT on a rotating black hole, and find that the CFT does not carry heat away from the black hole, but rather is confined to a halo around it. This is an artefact of strong coupling, and we comment on possible connections to soft condensed matter phenomena. In the second part of this dissertation, we probe the AdS/CFT dictionary via entanglement entropy. Specifically, we show that the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) prescription, which is a prescription for computing CFT entanglement entropy holographically, requires modification. We comment on possible modifications, and explore in depth the possibility of using complexified surfaces in the HRT prescription. Finally, we will approach the issue of bulk reconstruction via hole-ography, which attempts to reconstruct the bulk geometry from the entanglement entropy of regions of the CFT. We put some constraints on when this approach can succeed, and comment on why it might fail when it does.",,,
298,Activation of 5-HT1b Receptors in the Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis Attenuates the Negative/Anxiogenic Effects of Cocaine,"Consistent with the Opponent Process Theory of motivated behavior, cocaine administration produces dual and opposing affective states: an initial rewarding ""high"" followed by a dysphoric/anxiogenic ""crash"". It therefore seems likely that the motivation to seek cocaine is dependent upon the organism's assessment of the positive relative to the negative consequences of its use. While the neurobiology of the reinforcing aspects of cocaine has been well established, less is known about the systems responsible for the drug's negative actions. In this context, the current study involved an assessment of serotonergic (5-HT) function, which is enhanced by cocaine administration and has been linked to the presence of anxiogenic and depressive states in human and animal studies. In particular, we investigated the role of 5-HT within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) -- a structure within the extended amygdala that is activated during periods of stress and during the negative affective state associated with the withdrawal from drugs of abuse. The present study tested the hypothesis that increased 5-HT release in the BNST contributes to the anxiogenic effects of cocaine. A runway self-administration paradigm was employed in which animals were trained to traverse a straight alley in order to earn an infusion of IV cocaine (1.0mg/kg) delivered upon goal box entry. Testing consisted of 16 single daily trials. In this task, animals develop ambivalence about goal box entry (reflected by the development of approach/avoidance ""retreat"" behaviors) that we have shown to reflect the dual positive (rewarding) and negative (anxiogenic) associations that subjects form with the cocaine-paired goal-box. To assess the involvement of 5-HT signaling within the BNST on this conflict behavior, prior to each trial rats received bilateral intracranial injections of CP94,253 (0.5microg and 1.0microg/side in 0.5microl or aCSF vehicle), a potent and selective 5-HT1B agonist that inhibits local 5-HT release via activation of terminal autoreceptors. Results indicated that CP94,253 did not alter the positive incentive properties of cocaine (start latencies were unaffected) nor did it alter gross motor behavior (as revealed in subsequent locomotor activity testing). Treatments did, however, selectively attenuate the negative effects of cocaine, as indicated by a dose-dependent decrease in the frequency of approach-avoidance ""retreat"" behaviors. This effect was independent of whether the manipulation occurred before (10 mins prior) or after (5 mins post-infusion) cocaine self-administration. We therefore conclude that 5-HT signaling within the BNST likely contributes to the negative/anxiogenic effects of cocaine. This work supported by NIDA grant DA-033370 awarded to AE.",,,
299,"Promoting young children's understanding of the situations, thoughts, and prosocial responses related to jealousy","The current study examined young children's understanding of one complex emotion, jealousy. Specifically, the purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of emotion trainings on 5- to 8-year-old children's knowledge about the situations, thoughts, and prosocial responses related to jealousy. Additionally, the study further examined the relative effectiveness of two types of emotion training. Participants were 53 children (M = 84 months, SD = 6 months, age range: 68 to 96 months) recruited from the kindergarten and first-grade classrooms of two public elementary schools. Children were assigned either to one of two experimental emotion-training conditions or a control condition. Children in the experimental conditions were provided three emotion-training sessions to teach them about the situations, thoughts, and prosocial cognitive/behavioral responses related to jealousy while children in the control condition did not receive any emotion training. Both emotion trainings involved engaging children in discussions about the components of jealousy. For one training, the discussions were paired with the presentation of dynamic visual stimuli (i.e. animated video clips) while another training incorporated role-play exercises along with the discussions and video clips. All children were assessed for their understanding of jealousy using a free-recall task and a situation discrimination task. Children in the experimental conditions made significant pre- to post-test gains in their knowledge of all three components of jealousy after participating in the emotion trainings, while children in the control condition did not make significant pre- to post-test gains in their understanding. When comparing average pre- to post-test gains among conditions, the video and role play training was most effective at helping children improve their knowledge about jealousy-eliciting situations, although both emotion-trainings were equally effective at helping children acquire greater understandings of prosocial ways of responding to jealousy-eliciting situations. Children had the most difficulty acquiring more thorough understandings of the thoughts characteristic of jealousy. Limitations of the study along with the significance of the findings were discussed.",,,
301,Interdependence as a Lifeway: Decolonization and Resistance in Transnational Native American and Tibetan Communities,"Struggles for decolonization are not only national but also transnational and global. While decolonization projects are diverse, they generally call for both the undoing of colonization as a structure and the amelioration of its psychological and ideological effects. Native American communities have been waging resistance to settler societies in various ways for over 500 years. In the last 50 years, Tibetans in exile have mobilized a global project to resist Chinese occupation through the 'Tibet movement'. Native American religious traditions are rooted in a sacred relationship to the land, one's community and the spirit world. The spirit world consists of the dynamic 'life force' immanent in all natural phenomena. Native American peoples cite an interdependent relationship to all natural phenomena as the fundamental logic driving the protection of sacred sites, sustainable ways of living and nationhood. Tibetan Buddhism combines land-based conceptualizations of relatedness to Buddhist philosophical concepts of 'dependent origination' --meaning that all phenomena are inextricably 'dependent' on one another---to theorize a unique form of interdependence. Buddhist ethics rooted in interdependence encourage empathy and compassion for all others, since they are ultimately an extension of one's self. This dissertation analyzes the role of religion in the decolonization movements of transnational Native Americans and Tibetan communities living in the U.S. A core focus of many decolonization movements is resisting culture erasure through religious revitalization---the logic being religion constitutes the core values and traditions of a given community. When cultural identity is strengthened these communities are better able to resist colonial advances as well as practices of extermination. I ask, how does interdependence as a 'lived' tradition resist colonization as both a structure and ideology? In addition, how are these religious traditions informing global movements for decolonization? I argue that cultural regeneration---centrally in the form of religion practice---is a driving factor in resistance, if not sometimes the very practice of resistance. This research demonstrates that religious praxis not only resists cultural erasure and assuages colonization's psychic/psychological effects but also regenerates Tibetan and Native peoplehood, contributing to their projects of sovereignty. Religious praxis heals and strengthens these communities but is also understood to create the material conditions for liberation---in essence, spiritual phenomena re-configures the material world---for example, through the ritual purification of karma or the purification of one's body in the sweat lodge. The dynamic intersection of religion and politics in these movements provides a new perspective on social justice and humanitarianism, illustrating that the just and humane treatment of others is necessitated in world in which others are an extension of one's self.",,,
304,Music History Pedagogy in the Twenty-First Century: The Pedagogy Movement in American Musicology,"Since the turn of the twenty-first century, the field of music history pedagogy has experienced substantial growth and achieved an increased presence in the American Musicological Society (AMS). I argue this institutional and disciplinary shift resulted from a ""pedagogy movement"" in musicology, which helped cultivate a field of music history pedagogy. As some AMS members collaborated to fight for the legitimization of pedagogy within their professional society and created new venues for musicologists to talk about their teaching roles, the quantity of pedagogy discourse increased exponentially in essay collections, conference sessions, and a new journal devoted to music history pedagogy. In this dissertation, I analyze the development of pedagogy discourse and investigate the origins and evolution of the field in an attempt to better understand the personal, institutional, and cultural factors that led to its growth. I trace the origins of the field in the twentieth century, detail the twenty-first-century pedagogy movement, explore topical and methodological shifts in the pedagogy scholarship, and investigate the debate over changing the Object statement of the AMS. I examine American musicology's transforming relationship with pedagogy through the last century and seek to provide an historical and intellectual account of the field of music history pedagogy.",,,
305,Bread and Roses: Participatory Governance in Mexico and Venezuela,"This project is about discovering how some groups are working to build participatory governance as an alternative to the established processes that produce their marginalization. Governance refers to the decision-making processes at work in a given aggregate of people or territory, along with the more material outcomes of those processes, and affects social, political, economic, and cultural spheres. Therefore, changing governance has the potential to create comprehensive, systemic changes within those aggregates of people or territory, particularly for those who have been excluded from the benefits or even protection of existing processes. With this in mind, this project seeks to explore participatory governance as one possible avenue for systemic change. The following questions guide this exploration: What is participatory governance? Can it be an effective way for marginalized peoples to create alternative systems and structures to the ones that currently oppress them? By considering two living cases of participatory governance, in Mexico and Venezuela, this paper argues that participatory governance processes better serve the immediate needs of marginalized peoples and also empower them to create alternative, emancipatory systems by changing the priorities of governance through collective decision making. These questions are explored through the writings of those who are directly impacted by the participatory processes investigated in this piece, from both Mexico and Venezuela, as well as those who may have a different kind of stake in this debate, as outside observers, and sometimes as activists in their own contexts. Following this more theoretical exploration are two in-depth case studies of living participatory governance processes: in Zapatista communities in Chiapas, a Mexican state on the border with Guatemala; and in Chavista-governed Venezuela, where twenty-first century socialism has become the official guiding governance policy. These chapters articulate the governance structures in each of the respective national contexts, and explore the products of these governance processes surrounding education, health, and equitable development, since our measure of effective governance is often tied to the collective goods it is able to provide rather than simple sets of rules and regulations. Exploring these reformulations will ideally provide insight into alternative approaches to global governance processes currently overrun by certain exclusive and unsustainable mechanisms and hegemonies. Seeking alternatives is important because we live on a planet with finite resources, a growing population with disparate levels of consumption, and a changing climate. Conflict over arable land, clean water, and other valuable resources only promises to increase in the future, as communities face desertification or soil collapse, sea level rise, and regional conflict. Decreased conflict and increased equitability seem unlikely within the current world structure, so seeking alternative forms of governance, ways of living together, and resource management, takes on a new urgency. We must not wait until it is too late.",,,
306,Connecting text with knowledge,"Access to well-organized, precise knowledge is critical for many practical applications, such as Semantic Search, Reasoning and Question Answering. Real-world knowledge is often unstructured, noisy and embedded in texts. This inspires us to connect text with knowledge. Text can be seen as both the source and the destination of knowledge. In one direction, knowledge can be distilled from text. While in the other direction, knowledge can be leveraged to understand text. Therefore, connecting text with knowledge can benefit both knowledge harvesting and text understanding, and ultimately facilitate many other tasks. Connecting text with knowledge is challenging for several reasons. First, knowledge is implicit in text. Various kinds of signals need to be leveraged to distill knowledge out of noises. Second, text is inherently ambiguous. The same textual mention can have different meanings, depending on the contexts of its appearance. Finally, there is a gap existing between knowledge representation and text understanding/reasoning. In this thesis, we propose to tackle the challenges from two perspectives: (1) For linking text with knowledge, we study the entity linking problem. It links text mentions to the corresponding entries in a reference knowledge base, so that semantic information can be transferred from knowledge base to text, and then new knowledge can be harvested from text to complete the knowledge base. In this work we target for alleviating the limitations of using Wikipedia as the reference knowledge base. We design innovative models to mine evidences scattered in text corpus and leverage them to compensate the missing information in the reference knowledge base. (2) For leveraging knowledge for text understanding, we develop the ""coherent scene extraction"" algorithm to utilize background knowledge for filling in the implicit yet critical information in text and show its effectiveness in answering elementary science questions. All the methods proposed in this thesis are comprehensively evaluated on real-life data to demonstrate the power of connecting text with knowledge.",,,
307,Responses to Institutional Constraints,"Institutions, as mechanisms of social order, often constrain the behavior of individuals within a society. Political institutions constrain the behavior of politicians, financial institutions constrain the behavior of businesses and payment processors and social institutions often constrain the behavior of individuals. These institutions often play an important role in constraining activities that may be seen as illicit or unwanted and careful analysis of these constraints can allow researchers to learn more about activities that are often hidden or go unreported. This dissertation explores the role of institutional constraints on unwanted behavior by studying deforestation in Brazil and Malawi as well as underground activity in fraudulent software sales. These cases share the commonality that they are influenced by institutional constraints. Politicians in Brazil are constrained by reelection incentives, perpetrators of fraudulent antivirus software are constrained by payment processors and the cultural practice of ethnic favoritism in public good provision leads to particular ethnic groups in Malawi receiving much more fertilizer subsidies than others. The first chapter examines deforestation in Brazil. Local political authority (formal or informal) over natural resources may create rents for politicians. The political decision to use or allocate resources involves balancing private rents with reelection prospects. I examine the case of deforestation in Brazil and a presidential decree granting the federal government the authority to punish counties that failed to limit total deforestation within their borders. This collective punishment aimed to generate pressure on local politicians to slow deforestation. Using binding term limits as a source of variation in reelection eligibility, I find eligibility has no effect on deforestation prior to the decree. After the decree, reelection eligible mayors reduced annual deforestation 10% more than mayors ineligible for reelection. These findings are consistent with the equilibrium outcome of a lobbying model. Policies such as sanctions, which target the electorate in order to influence political behavior, may be less effective when politicians are not accountable to voters. The second chapter examines Fake antivirus (AV) programs which have been utilized to defraud millions of computer users into paying as much as one hundred dollars for a phony software license. As a result, fake AV software has evolved into one of the most lucrative criminal operations on the Internet. In this chapter, we examine the operations of three large scale fake AV businesses, lasting from three months to more than two years. More precisely, we present the results of our analysis on a trove of data obtained from several backend servers that the cybercriminals used to drive their scam operations. Our investigations reveal that these three fake AV businesses had earned a combined revenue of more than $130 million dollars. A particular focus of our analysis is on the financial and economic aspects of the scam, which involves legitimate credit card networks as well as more dubious payment processors. In particular, we present an economic model that demonstrates that fake AV companies are actively monitoring the refunds (chargebacks) that customers demand from their credit card providers. When the number of chargebacks increases in a short interval, the fake AV companies react to customer complaints by granting more refunds. This lowers the rate of chargebacks and ensures that a fake AV company can stay in business for a longer period of time. However, this behavior also leads to unusual patterns in chargebacks, which can potentially be leveraged by vigilant payment processors and credit card companies to identify and ban fraudulent firms. This chapter is joint work with Brett Stone-Gross, Richard Kremmerer, Christopher Kruegel, Douglas Steigerwald, and Giovanni Vigna and was published as Stone-Gross et al. (2013). The final chapter returns to deforestation and studies it in the context of agriculture in Malawi. The effect of development policies on the environment is often ambiguous ex ante. Programs designed to improve agricultural productivity may increase deforestation by raising the marginal productivity of agricultural land, thus increasing the demand for land clearing. However, in a setting of subsistence farming on unproductive land, increasing agricultural productivity may reduce the need to shift cultivation to maintain the desired yields. This chapter examines the impact of agricultural subsidies on deforestation in Malawi by leveraging ethnic favoritism in government resource allocation. By exploiting a change in the ethnicity of the Malawi president following the 2004 election, we show that coethnic districts received more fertilizer subsidies and experienced significant declines in deforestation compared to districts with other predominant ethnicities. This paper studies a case in which poverty alleviation programs have beneficial environ- mental impacts demonstrating that, in certain contexts, input subsidies may provide a 'win-win' scenario. This chapter is joint work with Conor Carney.",,,
308,"Evaluation of the environmental impacts of agricultural systems using life cycle thinking, focusing on marginal changes, technological advances, and regional characteristics","Driven by rapid adoption and sustained improvements of genetic technologies and agronomic management practices, agricultural productivity has experienced a substantial growth worldwide since the start of the green revolution in 1960s. This growth has enabled the humanity to escape from the well-known Malthusian Trap. With the success in agricultural productivity, however, comes what is also known as ""the other inconvenient truth"" (Foley 2009). That is, modern agriculture has become one of the major drivers of global environmental change and is pushing the earth system beyond its safe operating boundaries (Rockstrom et al. 2009). Further, even more challenges lie ahead, given the growing number of population and increasing diversion of foods to fuels. In this dissertation, three topics related to US agricultural systems are explored. In the first chapter, the environmental properties of US corn and cotton production and implications of land cover change from cotton to corn are evaluated using state-specific data and life cycle impact assessment. The results show that U.S. cotton and corn productions per hectare on average generate roughly similar impacts for most impact categories such as eutrophication and smog formation. Life cycle water use and freshwater ecotoxicity impacts of corn per hectare on average are smaller than those of cotton. When marginal impact is analyzed, however, the results show that the shifts from cotton to corn in cotton-growing states aggravates most of the regional environmental impacts while relieving freshwater ecotoxicity impact. The differences in the two estimates are due mainly to underlying regional disparities in crop suitability that affects input structure and environmental emissions. In the second chapter, the carbon payback time (CPT) of corn ethanol expansion is re-examined considering three aspects: (1) yields of newly converted lands (i.e., marginal yield), (2) technology improvements over time within the corn ethanol system, and (3) temporal sensitivity of climate change impacts. The results show that without technological advances, the CPT estimates for corn ethanol from newly converted Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land exceed 100 years for all Marginal to Average (MtA) yield ratios tested except for the case where MtA yield ratio is 100 %. When the productivity improvements within corn ethanol systems since previous CPT estimates and their future projections are considered, the CPT estimates fall into the range of 15 years (100 % MtA yield ratio) to 56 years (50 % MtA yield ratio), assuming land conversion takes place in early 2000s. Incorporating diminishing sensitivity of GHG emissions to future emissions year by year, however, increases the CPT estimates to17 to 88 years. For 60 MtA yield ratio, the CPT is estimated to be 43 years, which is relatively close to previous CPT estimates (i.e., 40 to 48 years) but with very different underlying reasons. In the third chapter, the trends and underlying drivers of changes in non-global environmental impacts of major crops in the U.S. are investigated. The results show that the impact per hectare corn and cotton generated on the ecological health of freshwater systems decreased by about 50% in the last decade. This change is associated with the use of genetically modified (GM) crops, which has reduced the application of insecticides and relatively toxic herbicides such as atrazine. However, the freshwater water ecotoxicity impact per hectare soybean produced increased by 3-fold, mainly because the spread of invasive species, soybean aphid, has resulted in an increasing use of insecticides. In comparison, other impact categories remained relatively stable. By evaluating the relative ecotoxicity potential of a large number of pesticides, our analysis offers new insight into the benefits associated with genetically modified (GM) crops. The finding that different impact categories show different degrees of changes suggests that agricultural inventory data can be updated selectively in LCA to maximize cost-effectiveness.",,,
309,Investigating Intracellular Pathways of Surface-Functionalized Cationic Lipid-DNA Nanoparticles using Quantitative Fluorescence Microscopy,"The delivery of functional nucleic acids has the potential to treat the large number of diseases that stem from missing, defective or over expressed genes. A major challenge in the development of gene therapy-based treatments is the efficient delivery of nucleic acids to the proper tissue or cell type. One promising approach in gene therapy is the implementation of a vector or carrier capable of actively targeting and delivering the therapeutic nucleic acid to the afflicted cells. In this work, the structural and biological properties of peptide-grafted, lipid-based nanoparticles for the delivery of nucleic acids are investigated using cryo-electron microscopy, light scattering and fluorescence microscopy coupled with software-assisted automated image analysis. Cryo-electron microscopy and light scattering show that lipid- DNA nanoparticles can coexist at equilibrium with unexpected structures such as thread-like micelles and DNA-tethered nanoparticles when mixed in the appropriate conditions. Quantitative image analysis of fluorescent micrographs shows that grafting of targeting peptides to lipid nanoparticles promotes their internalization in cells but the major bottleneck to efficient nanoparticle-mediated delivery of nucleic acids is endosomal entrapment. Endosomal pathways are a means for cells to internalize and deliver cargo to the appropriate intracellular location. Using members of the Rab GTPase family to label various stages of the endocytic pathway, we investigated the properties of lipid-DNA nanoparticles that influence their intracellular trafficking and efficiency. Studies using wildtype Rab5 and mutant Rab5-Q79L show that escape from the endosomal pathway occurs downstream of early endosomes. Using markers for late and recycling endosomes, Rab 7/9 and Rab11, respectively, we show that nanoparticles with high membrane charge density and cholesterol are preferentially trafficked through the degradative pathway which is conducive to efficient nucleic acid delivery. This conclusion is further supported by the improved efficacy of pH-sensitive nanoparticles capable of shedding their PEG layer and escaping endosomes in the low pH environment of the late endosome. Lastly, we used fluorescence microscopy and quantitative image analysis to investigate the effect of targeting peptide (iRGD, cRGDfK, linear RGD or RPARPAR) on the trafficking and efficiency of nanoparticles. These results should guide future design of lipid nanoparticles for nucleic acid delivery applications.",,,
310,"The Metamorphic and Magmatic History of the Ross Orogen in Southern Victoria Land, Antarctica","The process of subduction has significant influence on the geochemical evolution of the crust and mantle, and subduction-related magmatism may have been an important mechanism for the growth of continental crust over time. Extensive exposure of the mid-crustal levels of an ancient, exhumed continental arc in the Transantarctic Mountains provides an exceptional opportunity to study the metamorphic and magmatic processes associated with an archetypal subduction zone. The belt of multiply deformed metamorphic rocks and granitoid batholiths records convergence and subduction of paleo-Pacific oceanic lithosphere beneath East Antarctica during the Neoproterozoic--Paleozoic Ross orogeny. These rocks are especially well exposed in the southern Victoria Land (sVL) segment of the Transantarctic Mountains----the largest ice-free area of Antarctica. The metamorphic and igneous rocks in sVL provide insights into the early stages of convergent-margin tectonism, the compositional diversity of subduction-related magmatism, and the relative roles of crustal growth and recycling in continental arcs. In Chapter 1 of this dissertation, garnet Lu-Hf and monazite U-Pb geochronology---combined with petrography, mineral chemistry, and thermobarometry---reveal a Barrovian-style metamorphic history that predated the dominant phase of magmatism in sVL. The geochronology data from this study provide one of the oldest records of tectonism along the Ross orogen. The results are consistent with a tectonic model that involves shortening across the margin of East Antarctica prior to the major phase of subduction-related magmatism. Chapter 2 explores the age and magma sources of a large subduction-related igneous complex in the Dry Valleys area. Zircon U-Pb geochronology demonstrates that the period of magmatism in the Dry Valleys was relatively short-lived compared to other segments of the Ross orogen. Whole-rock geochemistry and Hf isotopes in zircon reveal the assimilation of ancient crust during the differentiation of juvenile magmas that were likely derived from an enriched sub-continental lithospheric mantle source. A compilation of Nd and Sr isotope data from granitoids from along the Ross orogen suggest that enriched lithospheric mantle may have been a common juvenile magma source along the arc. In Chapter 3, a comprehensive geochemical, geochronologic, and isotopic investigation of the magmatism in sVL explores the conspicuous occurrence of alkaline silicate rocks and carbonatites---most commonly associated with intraplate and continental-rift magmatism---within the continental arc. The alkaline magmatism was partially contemporaneous with the emplacement of large sub-alkaline igneous complexes in adjacent segments of the arc. The isotopic and trace element composition of the alkaline and subalkaline rocks suggests derivation from geochemically enriched sources---potentially metasomatized sub-continental lithospheric mantle. Despite enriched isotopic and trace element compositions that broadly resemble recycled continental crust, binary mixing and assimilation-fractional crystallization models indicate that crustal growth may have been dominant over crustal reworking in the sVL magmatism.",,,
311,Hetero-structured nanomaterials for surface plasmonic photocatalysis,"The direct solar energy conversion to chemical energy based on the photo-production of electron--hole pairs with photocatalysts has been intensively studied in both academia and industry. To explore and design new higher efficiency schemes for the production of energetic charge carriers is one of the core methodologies for the development of high performance semiconductor-based photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices. Surface plasmonic solar energy conversion has been proposed as a promising alternative of conventional semiconductor-based systems. The new paradigm involves the generation of energetic electrons from the metallic nanostructures or the energy transfer with the highly enhanced local energy flux by the surface plasmons. The very important feature of the surface plasmon resonance is that the wavelength of absorption is greatly dependent on the morphology of nanostructure. Thus it is possible to design plasmonic devices that can harvest photons over the entire solar spectrum without changing the chemical composition. This new strategy provides opportunities of developing new photocatalytic material/device with higher energy conversion efficiency, while keeping fabrication costs low. The strategy to realize this conception is by using a set of nanostructures that are rationally designed to track the solar spectrum. In this thesis, we demonstrate that such a combination can effectively improve the conversion efficiency by the panchromatic absorption. Furthermore, in the consideration of fabrication cost, a bottom-up strategy for the fabrication of the ordered Janus structure is developed using the molecular soft template to guide the proper assembly of different components. Beyond the fabrication cost, we put efforts to realize the surface plasmon photocatalysis with earth abundant materials. The chemically prepared uniform TiO2 coated copper nanowires exhibited excellent photocatalytic activities. Moreover, the activity has been found directly related with the surface plasmon copper metal rather than any copper oxides. I believe this thesis work can inspire the material research community for the development of new surface plasmon photocatalyst, as well as new methods of the synthetic reactions for metal-semiconductor hetero-structured nanomaterials.",,,
312,Novel reactivity and asymmetric transformations with nitroso compounds,"The development of efficient methods for the synthesis of highly functionalized chiral molecules is of great interest in organic chemistry. Given the ubiquity of nitrogen and oxygen containing compounds in nature and biologically relevant molecules, the direct asymmetric construction of C-N and C-O bonds becomes invaluable. While arylnitroso compounds are known sources of electrophilic nitrogen and oxygen, their use is inherently limited by their known toxicity and the difficulty of removing the N-aryl group for subsequent C-N bond forming reactions. Our group has focused on the use of nitrosocarbonyl intermediates which are generated in situ from substituted hydroxylamines and bear readily removable protecting groups on nitrogen. Nitrosocarbonyl intermediates are highly reactive and prone to decomposition using traditional stoichiometric oxidation processes. We postulated that the identification of a mild oxidation protocol would offer a marked improvement to known reaction platforms and facilitate the development of un-discovered synthetic transformations. The context for developing nitrosocarbonyl chemistry will be provided through an overview of relevant nitroso compounds, with an emphasis on synthesis and reactivity. The discovery of the nitrosocarbonyl aldol reaction is a major component of this thesis, and this will be prefaced with a review on the state of the art in this area. The asymmetric nitroso ene reaction has long remained an elusive target in this area of research, and presented herein is an account of the first general asymmetric nitrosocarbonyl ene reaction, along with a proposed strategy to access enantioselective transformations with nitroso compounds.",,,
313,Extracting the Truth: How Coexisting with the Black Gold Reshapes Lives and Livelihoods in 21st Century Colombia,"There have been many pitfalls resultant from our current civilization's dependence on oil and gas, though none has been more ignored than the impacts of hydrocarbon production on our fellow human beings. This thesis has three primary aims: (1) to make clear the theoretical frameworks that have led these human impacts to be ignored, including Resource Curse Theory, and to propose Political Ecology as a new framework for understanding the challenges that resource extraction levies on individuals and communities; (2) to detail, document, and highlight the widespread, complex, and generative impacts that resource extraction itself produces in order to begin seeking real solutions; and (3) to bring to the fore the struggles of the Colombian people in relation to hydrocarbon production and resource extraction. As shall be seen, Colombia is a unique though entirely ignored case study of rapidly expanding hydrocarbon production. While thought to be a 'success' in the eyes of many, this thesis shows the true nature of oil and gas production by focusing in on the deep structural changes that the southern community of Puerto Gaitan has endured since the arrival of Canadian oil company Pacific Rubiales, and explaining how these deeper problems are reproduced in other extractive areas across Latin America and the world.",,,
314,Optimal execution with order flow,"In this thesis we examine optimal execution models that take into account both market microstructure impact and informational costs. Informational footprint is related to order flow and is represented by the trader's influence on the expected order flow process, while microstructure influence is captured by instantaneous price impact. Indeed, a key piece of information missing from many execution models in the literature is the temporal summary of recent order flow which is known to have an impact on the behavior of liquidity providers. Instead, execution and limit order book models often consider only the limited information summarized by a snapshot of the limit order book. Excluded then, are the important mesoscopic trends in market order flow as well as the informational impact made when an executed order perturbs the expected order flow process. In the following chapters, we propose several continuous-time stochastic control problems that balance between microstructure and informational costs. Incorporating the trade imbalance leads to the consideration of the current market state and specifically whether one's orders lean with or against the prevailing order flow. Several objective functions are treated, as we account for both symmetric and asymetric execution costs that arise when trading under differing market conditions. We then initiate statistical analysis on Nasdaq limit order book data to investigate the links between market order flow, price impact and liquidity at the mesoscopic timescale. We find that temporal measures of order flow play a key role in the price formation process and show how these features can be incorporated into an execution model for which closed-form solutions can be obtained.",,,
315,Reincorporating Traditional Knowledge into Agricultural Development Paradigms: A Look at the Food and Agriculture Organization's Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System Initiative in Chile,"The concept of food security that global institutions, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), have emphasized for decades does not promote the engagement of people suffering from hunger and poverty. Food sovereignty, on the other hand, advocates for people having complete control of their local food system. This concept is meant to return power to the people worldwide that are producing the majority of the global food supply, despite the dominance of industrial agriculture in global export markets. Food sovereignty also supports the use of local and traditional agricultural knowledge as part of developing and maintaining successful food systems, while food security does not specifically support such knowledge and instead promotes simply ""knowledge of basic nutrition and care"" (""Food Security"", n.d.). This thesis will first provide a brief historical background of the role of agriculture in Chilean development, discuss the main arguments for why small-scale agriculture is more sustainable than large-scale industrial agriculture, and explore the connections between the concepts of traditional ecological knowledge and food sovereignty. Second, a brief history of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) will be outlined, tracing its evolution from its inception in 1945 until today. The FAO is in the midst of reform and its changing attitudes have paved the way for new initiatives, such as the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS) initiative. The third chapter concentrates on the region of Chiloe, a GIAHS site in southern Chile. This chapter aims to demonstrate the following: 1) the structure of the GIAHS initiative in Chiloe and its main objectives in the region, 2) the challenges this initiative faces within Chiloe, and 3) how the valuation of agricultural heritage can help support an alternative model of agricultural development within the region. Rethinking the concept of food security as food sovereignty can help put power back into hands of local producers and consumers and thus promote more culturally-appropriate food systems and the development of policies that better support small-scale producers. Though the FAO's GIAHS initiative is still new and there are not yet results as to whether it will help increase valuation of traditional agriculture and its products, it is still an example of an alternative development paradigm and how this alternative, typically associated with grassroots peasants' movements, NGOs and bottom-up approaches, has made its way to the institutional level.",,,
316,Accelerating coagulation in traumatic injuries using inorganic nanoparticles,"Trauma remains the leading cause of mortality between the ages of 1 and 44 in the United States. Uncontrolled blood loss accounts for 50 % of all battlefield deaths and up to 25 % of civilian trauma deaths. This mortality is often the result of a severe clotting impairment known as acute traumatic coagulopathy. Therefore, hemorrhage control remains the a priori goal in the care of the critically injured patient. While great advances have been made in the resuscitation of the injured patient, attenuating bleeding and correction of coagulopathy remain vexing clinical problems. Current clotting treatments are plagued by concerns over excessive cost, poor stability, and safety issues. In this defense, I present a silica nanoparticle (SNP) functionalized with polyphosphate (polyP) that mediates the body's natural clotting process. SNPs initiate the blood clotting system's contact pathway, while the endogenous short-chain polyP accelerates the common pathway via rapid formation of thrombin. This enhances the overall blood-clotting system, both by accelerating fibrin generation and by facilitating the regulatory anticoagulation mechanisms essential for hemostasis. Because of its low production cost, long-term stability at ambient conditions, and the potential to minimize side effects seen in current treatments, the polyP-SNP therapeutic has the possibility to enable the body to re-establish hemostasis after traumatic injury, preventing massive blood loss and saving lives.",,,
317,Stochastic flocking and its application to systemic risk with jumps,"In this dissertation, we first study the effect of jumps on a stochastic flocking model and discuss characteristics of this model. We investigate its application to understand systemic risk by proposing an interbank lending model with jump diffusions and further show that there will be a higher systemic risk with jumps (i.e., sudden increases or decreases in reserves) in our model. Then, to examine how the systemic risk will be affected when each bank is acting toward their best self-interest, we integrate a game feature with jumps where each bank controls its rate of borrowing/lending to a central bank. We then solve Nash equilibria with finitely many players in this game with jumps, within which the central bank acts as a clearing house and adds liquidity to the system. The result indicates that the linear growth contributed by jumps to the system does not affect the systemic risk in the model. Finally, we propose another model with a central bank as well as peripheral banks and investigate the impact of interaction between all banks on systemic risk. The systemic risk might be reduced if the central bank is allowed to monitor liquidity by solving an optimal control problem. We also provide a mean-field game approach to approximate the equilibria for finitely many players.",,,
318,Using ion mobility-mass spectrometry to understand amyloid beta-protein assembly: The effects of small molecule inhibitors and familial mutations,"Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) has been correlated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) which is the most common form of dementia. Abeta proteins assemble into oligomers, large aggregates, protofibrils before growing into fibrils. Recently more and more evidence has shown that the intermediate, oligomeric states of Abeta, rather than the fibrils are correlated with AD pathology. Among them, the 56 kDa dodecamer species was identified as a proximate toxic agent for AD onset. Therefore to understand the early oligomerization of Abeta proteins and to target the early assembly of Abeta are of significance for therapeutic strategy for AD treatment. In this thesis work, we use mass spectrometry coupled with ion mobility spectrometry method (IM-MS) to investigate the early assembly of Abeta proteins. In the first, we sought to search for small molecule inhibitors for Abeta and understand their binding interactions and the mechanism of inhibitory actions. Several classes of small molecules, including Z-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone (PADK), two derivatives of the Abeta C-terminal fragment Abeta(39-42), molecular tweezers, and ML, have been studied and shown different effects. These studies of small molecule inhibitors show that ion mobility spectrometry method has emerged to be a powerful tool for the screening and understanding of small molecule inhibitors for AD and other amyloid diseases. In the second, we sought to understand the effects of amino acid substitutions on Abeta structure and aggregation. Two recently discovered familial mutations at Ala2 (A2) within Abeta, a protective A2T mutation and a recessive A2V mutation were investigated. Our ion mobility studies reveal different assembly pathways for early oligomer formation for each peptide and provide a basis for understanding how these two mutations lead to, or protect against, AD. Lastly, we also sought to understand the early assembly of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) from different rodent species. We investigate the biophysical and biological properties of Abeta peptides from humans, mice (Mus musculus), and rats (Octodon degus). In conclusion, we have successfully applied ion mobility spectrometry method to understand complicated aggregation systems. This provides a powerful tool to screen small molecule inhibitors for Abeta proteins and sheds light onto their inhibitory mechanisms. The studies of Abeta mutants imply that ion mobility method can be used as new tool in developing an understanding of the effect of familial mutations on Abeta assembly in AD and the assembly of other mutated protein systems.",,,
320,"The biomimetic, rational, and quanitative design of cooperative receptors and responsive materials","Because the ability to effectively detect and respond to subtle chemical cues is so crucial to biological function, evolution has invented many diverse, intricate mechanisms for the robust, precise sensing of molecular stimuli. The ability to systematically recreate such mechanisms in artificial systems would likewise be useful in many biotechnologies, for example in biosensors, synthetic biology, and targeted drug delivery. In response, the work I present here focuses on the rational, quantitative recreation of biological mechanisms of sensing and actuation in artificial biomolecular systems. The first aim of my thesis work, detailed in Chapters 2 and 3, centered on the rational engineering of allosteric cooperativity into normally non-cooperative artificial receptors. This mechanism, which occurs when multiple copies of identical target molecule bind to a receptor in an ""all-or-nothing"" fashion, increases the order of the binding curve, narrowing the transition window between bound and unbound, and enhancing the receptors' sensitivity to small changes in target concentration. To achieve this effect requires that the first copy of target molecule to bind shift the receptor from a low-affinity to a high-affinity conformation, thus increasing its affinity for the binding of subsequent copies of target molecule. Chapter 2 centers on proof-of-concept efforts to engineering this mechanism into a particularly simple and well-understood model receptor, a DNA-binding molecular beacon. I follow this in Chapter 3 with the development of a disorder-based strategy suitable for the introduction of cooperativity into more complex receptors, including even those of unknown structure. The second aim of my thesis work, detailed in Chapters 4 and 5, focused on the engineering of multicomponent, stimulus-responsive biomolecular systems from a different perspective, specifically on the development of a quantitative understanding of the physics of stimulus-responsive materials. Materials that assemble and dissolve in response to chemical stimuli are ubiquitous in Biology, for example in transport vesicles, viruses, and cell membranes. As with the imitation of allosteric cooperativity, the ability to rationally imitate the properties of these materials in an artificial, technological context would be useful in many applications. Although there exist many successful examples of such artificial, stimulus-responsive materials, design efforts thus far have been fairly qualitative, and systematic approaches to systematically control their properties do not exist. Part of the reason for this is that the relationship between properties such as network architecture and cooperativity, thermodynamic stability and molecular and micron scale behavior are not well understood, and there is a lack of simple, quantitative techniques for measuring the response of these materials. In response, I developed simple, straightforward techniques to measure the dissolution of a model hydrogel simultaneously at both the molecular and micron length scales, which I describe in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, I employed these methods to explore the relationship between the thermodynamic stability and response kinetics of a model hydrogel, demonstrating the ability to quantitatively control the materials response kinetics using simple strategies previously applied for the quantitative tuning of solution-phase biomolecular switches.",,,
321,How To Be A Dogmatist,"According to the epistemological theory known as dogmatism, if one, for example, has a perceptual experience as of a red cube, one is immediately and defeasibly warranted in believing that there is a red cube there. The warrant is immediate in that it does not depend on one's other beliefs or on any introspectively accessible mental states besides the experience itself. The warrant is defeasible in that it is capable of being defeated by other considerations (e.g. doubts about the reliability of one's perceptual apparatus). My dissertation has three goals: (1) to defend dogmatism as a general thesis against objections, with particular focus on the arguments of Stewart Cohen, Roger White, and Crispin Wright; (2) to argue against internalist dogmatist proposals like those offered by Michael Huemer, James Pryor, and Declan Smithies; and (3) to present an original externalist theory of perceptual warrant, that I dub Competent Dogmatism, and argue that it is superior to competing accounts. With regards to the third goal: I claim that the subject's perceptual system itself is normatively evaluable with regards to its ability to produce reliably veridical representations and the manner in which it does so. There are an infinite number of possible representations of the world that are compatible with the retina being stimulated in a particular way. In order to solve this underdetermination problem, our visual systems make a set of assumptions about the environment (for example: that illumination typically comes from above, and not below). My proposed theory of perceptual warrant relies on the notion of perceptual competence. A subject's perceptual system is competent, if and only if: (1) the assumptions the perceptual system makes of its immediate environment are typically true of the subject's normal environment, (2) the sub-personal inferential or information processing processes conform to veridicality preserving norms, and (3) the perceptual system reliably produce veridical representations of the subject's normal environment. When one's perceptual system is competent in this sense, the representations it produces provide immediate and defeasible warrant for beliefs about one's environment. On my proposal the normal environment is the environment in which the assumptions and information processing processes the perceptual system uses where developed.",,,
322,"fuhc(me), fuhc(you): Understanding Allorecognition in Botryllus schlosseri","Allorecognition, the ability to distinguish self from non-self tissue, is the foundation in both arms of mammalian immunity: adaptive and innate. In mammalian systems, recognition of self from non-self is dependent upon the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and has been extensively studied. Interestingly, components of the MHC-based immunity have not been identified below the jawed vertebrates based on sequence homology. This pose the questions of how the MHC evolved and how immune cells are educated against self-MHC; neither are fully understood. Here we utilized Botryllus schlosseri as a model organism to investigate the evolution of MHC and the mechanism of immune education. B. schlosseri is a colonial ascidian (sea squirt) belonging to the subphylum Tunicata, the most primitive chordates. They sit at a key evolutionary position since tunicates are considered the closest living relatives of the vertebrates. With a well-document natural transplantation ability to fuse with another individual outside of their bodies, B. schlosseri can offer new insights and understanding to these enigmatic, important questions. The B. schlosseri allorecognition system parallels that of the vertebrate Natural Killer (NK) cell's ""missing-self"" recognition. When two individuals come into contact at the peripheries of their extra-corporeal vasculature system, they can either anastomose to form a hematopoietic and vascular chimera or undergo a blood based inflammatory ""rejection"" response and form a melanin scar at the site of interaction. The allorecognition response is dependent on a single highly polymorphic locus called the fusion / histocompatibility locus (fuhc ). If two individuals share at least one fuhc allele, then a fusion will occur; otherwise they will reject. This simplified allorecognition system makes B. schlosseri an attractive experimental model to further our understanding of how MHC evolved and the mechanisms underlying immune cell education. As an emerging model organism, B. schlosseri is able to provide new insights to the evolution and mechanisms of allorecognition. However, there are not many established protocols to thoroughly investigate the allorecognition system in B. schlosseri. Here we report the generation of new in culture, in vitro, and in silico tools to establish a stronger molecular foundation for future work in B. schlosseri (Chapter II). From this toolkit, we discovered genotypes in the population that express specific levels of uncle fester that exhibit preferential POR localization (Chapter III). Finally, we characterized in vitro an allorecognition candidate, Botryllus histocompatibility factor , and reported a new isoform along with their subcellular localization when expressed in mammalian cells (Chapter IV).",,,
323,Technological change in the life cycle assessment of rapidly expanding greenhouse gas mitigation technologies: case studies on thin-film photovoltaics and LED lighting,"Mitigating climate change will require unprecedented deployment of a wide variety of technologies, many of which are in the early stages of development. Assessing the long-term environmental and natural resource risks, benefits of many of these technologies is challenging due to their changing capabilities, costs and resource requirements. This dissertation consists of three articles that explore the nature of technological change in the assessment of rapidly expanding greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation technologies using hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA). Thin-film photovoltaics (PV), including cadmium telluride (CdTe) and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), are rapidly-growing renewable electricity generation technologies. Thin films have improved significantly recently, and similar improvements are expected in the future, warranting re-evaluation of the environmental implications of PV to update and inform policy decisions. The life cycle impacts of thin films can be reduced by several likely cost-reducing technological changes: (1) module efficiency increases (2) module dematerialization (3) changes in upstream energy and materials production and (4) end-of-life recycling of balance of system (BOS). Results show comparable environmental and resource impacts for CdTe and CIGS. Compared to the US electricity mix in 2010, both perform at least 90% better in 7 of 12, and at least 50% better in 3 of 12 impact categories, with comparable land use, and increased metal depletion unless BOS recycling is ensured. Technological changes, particularly efficiency increases, contribute to 35-80% reductions in all impacts by 2030. Efficient lighting based on light emitting diodes (LEDs) is another technology that is increasingly being deployed to save energy and thus mitigate GHG emissions. Efficient LED light sources currently have lower environmental and natural resource impacts than traditional light sources, and are expected to see dramatic improvements in luminous efficacy and possibly their life cycle environmental impacts in the future. Aggressive deployment of these increasingly efficient LED lamps and luminaires along with decarbonization of electricity generation can reduce the life cycle GHG emissions from the global provision of lighting by more than a factor of seven while at the same time stabilizing metal depletion and allowing global demand for lighting services to grow by 2.5 - 2.9 times by 2050. LCA results show that technological changes can influence the assessment of GHG mitigation technologies, but existing models are not adequate for predicting the rates of technological changes and how those changes affect the life cycle environmental impacts and resource requirements of technologies. Technology learning curves use empirical observations to show how the costs of technologies decline with increased cumulative production, but do not distinguish the direct and supply chain by which cost reductions are achieved. The final chapter of this dissertation proposes a mathematical framework to separate the effects of learning on the intermediate inputs to a technology from the effects of learning on value added, and incorporates those technological learning effects throughout the supply chain of a technology based on the computational structure of LCA. An example for CdTe PV shows that technology learning throughout the supply chain can contribute to observed learning rates for GHG mitigation technologies.",,,
324,"On wafer-bonded junctions and transistors - Design, fabrication, challenges and discoveries","The use of epitaxial junctions, especially heterojunctions, like InGaAs/InAlAs, AlGaN/GaN, has yielded transistors switching at high frequency or high voltage. It is however generally found that a high frequency transistor remains deficient in breakdown voltage and vice versa, a limitation of heterojunctions between similar materials by epitaxial methods. Wafer bonding, on the contrary, allows junctions between mismatched materials, and so may be a promising technique to overcome the trade-off between high frequency operation of and the available power from a transistor. This work focuses on the experimental demonstration of a well-behaved wafer-bonded junction and transistor, namely, an InGaAs/InGaN junction and an InGaAs/III-Nitride transistor, respectively. The latter is referred to as a wafer-bonded current aperture vertical transistor, BAVET, comprising a channel in InGaAs and a drift region in InGaN/GaN. In this work, key features of a BAVET are identified, designed, and fabricated. Fundamental to the operation of the transistor is the design of a conductive aperture and an insulating current-blocking layer (CBL). This property in a BAVET results in an on current as high as 600 mA.mm-1 and a transconductance of 132 mS.mm-1. Despite the fact that these results mark the first demonstration of transistor operation in a BAVET, other aspects of the on- and off-state performances remain weak. For instance, saturation voltage, on-resistance, turn-on voltage, and output conductance are anomalously high and off-state pinch-off is poor. Mechanisms pertaining to virtual gate, drain resistance, weak field plating and trap ionization are found to be the cause of these anomalies. Experiments prove that all anomalies are local to the wafer-bonded interface (WBI). This work determines that passivation of traps at WBI is a solution to these drawbacks in device performance. An in-situ trap passivation process is devised, which uses hydrogen species and the layer structure electrostatics to effect trap activity. This improves all aspects of the BAVET performance, with the saturation voltage, drain resistance, turn-on voltage and output conductance significantly lowered and critical field to trap-ionization made higher. In addition to designing the BAVET, the dissertation makes progress in understanding the physics of WBI and its relation to functioning of a BAVET. In passivating traps at WBI, a means to improve the wafer-bonded junction and transistor is conceived. The work succeeds in demonstrating a trap-free wafer-bonded InGaAs/InGaN junction, an anomaly-free III-Arsenide/III-Nitride vertical transistor and so reveals a new space of possibilities in the field of wafer-bonded electronics.",,,
325,"Examining the Math Attitudes, Math Self-Efficacy, and STEM Outcomes Among Native and Non-Native English Speakers Using a Latent Class Analysis","Our nation faces an exponentially high demand for science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) professionals and a scarce supply of individuals who pursue STEM careers, especially multilingual individuals. Particularly among students who are non-native English speakers (i.e., students whose native language is not English), there is little information on what role math attitudes and math self-efficacy play in understanding STEM outcomes. This information is critical to inform educators and policymakers on how to better prepare students and provide them the proper skills to be college and career-ready in STEM careers. To address this need, this dissertation explores the relationship between native and non-native English speakers' math attitudes and math self-efficacy with their 12th grade math achievement, STEM bachelor degree attainment, and STEM career attainment. More specifically, this study examines students' STEM outcomes at three levels of educational attainment including the graduation of high school, community college, and university. Using the Education Longitudinal Study (ELS:2002), I performed a latent class analysis (LCA) to group a nationally representative sample of U.S. 10 th grade students (N=9,270) based on their math attitudes and math self-efficacy. Fitting independent LCAs on the sample of non-native and native English speaking groups revealed that there were different patterns of math attitudes and math self-efficacy among these groups. Results from this study suggest that regardless of English proficiency level, female students were less likely to have high math attitudes and high math self-efficacy beliefs relative to their male peers. In regards to STEM outcomes, students with high math attitudes and high math self-efficacy had higher 12th math achievement scores and had higher proportions of individuals with a STEM degree and STEM career. In particular, results from this study suggest that math self-efficacy played a stronger role in predicting STEM outcomes regardless of math attitudes. In regards to non-native English speakers, those with at least a bachelor's degree were not far behind their native English speaking peers in terms of their STEM outcomes. Findings from this study will help educators and researchers understand ways to support positive math attitudes and math self-efficacy, particularly for non-native English speakers and female students so that they can persist in STEM and meet the high demand for STEM professionals. Additionally, findings from this study indicate the need for positive perceptions of non-native speakers and recognize the important roles they may play in creating a multilingual STEM workforce.",,,
326,III-V Ultra-Thin-Body InGaAs/InAs MOSFETs for Low Standby Power Logic Applications,"As device scaling continues to sub-10-nm regime, III-V InGaAs/InAs metal- oxide-semiconductor ?eld-e?ect transistors (MOSFETs) are promising candidates for replacing Si-based MOSFETs for future very-large-scale integration (VLSI) logic applications. III-V InGaAs materials have low electron effective mass and high electron velocity, allowing higher on-state current at lower VDD and reducing the switching power consumption. However, III-V InGaAs materials have a narrower band gap and higher permittivity, leading to large band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) leakage or gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) at the drain end of the channel, and large subthreshold leakage due to worse electrostatic integrity. To utilize III-V MOSFETs in future logic circuits, III-V MOSFETs must have high on-state performance over Si MOSFETs as well as very low leakage current and low standby power consumption. In this dissertation, we will report InGaAs/InAs ultra-thin-body MOSFETs. Three techniques for reducing the leakage currents in InGaAs/InAs MOSFETs are reported as described below. 1) Wide band-gap barriers: We developed AlAs0.44Sb0.56 barriers lattice-match to InP by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and studied the electron transport in In0.53Ga0.47As/AlAs 0.44Sb0.56 heterostructures. The InGaAs channel MOSFETs using AlAs0.44Sb0.56 bottom barriers or p-doped In0.52 Al0.48As barriers were demonstrated, showing significant suppression on the back barrier leakage. 2) Ultra-thin channels: We investigated the electron transport in InGaAs and InAs ultra-thin quantum wells and ultra-thin body MOSFETs (t ch ~ 2-4 nm). For high performance logic, InAs channels enable higher on-state current, while for low power logic, InGaAs channels allow lower BTBT leakage current. 3) Source/Drain engineering: We developed raised InGaAs and recessed InP source/drain spacers. The raised InGaAs source/drain spacers improve electrostatics, reducing subthreshold leakage, and smooth the electric field near drain, reducing BTBT leakage. With further replacement of raised InGaAs spacers by recessed, doping-graded InP spacers at high field regions, BTBT leakage can be reduced ~100:1. Using the above-mentioned techniques, record high performance InAs MOSFETs with a 2.7 nm InAs channel and a ZrO2 gate dielectric were demonstrated with Ion = 500 microA/microm at Ioff = 100 nA/microm and VDS =0.5 V, showing the highest on-state performance among all the III-V MOSFETs and comparable performance to 22 nm Si FinFETs. Record low leakage InGaAs MOSFETs with recessed InP source/drain spacers were also demonstrated with minimum I off = 60 pA/microm at 30 nm-Lg , and Ion = 150 microA/microm at I off = 1 nA/microm and VDS =0.5 V. This recessed InP source/drain spacer technique improves device scalability and enables III-V MOSFETs for low standby power logic applications. Furthermore, ultra-thin InAs channel MOSFETs were fabricated on Si substrates, exhibiting high yield and high transconductance gm ~2.0 mS/microm at 20 nm- Lg and VDS =0.5 V. With further scaling of gate lengths, a 12 nm-Lg III-V MOSFET has shown maximum Ion/Ioff ratio ~8.3x105 , confirming that III-V MOSFETs are scalable to sub-10-nm technology nodes.",,,
327,"The Color of NASA: Racial Inclusion in the American Space Program, 1957-1978","This dissertation examines the relationship between the civil rights movement and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) manned space program between 1957 and 1978. From its onset, the motivations and justifying factors for the American manned space program were primarily political in nature. The issue of race, though not a factor in deciding space policy, played a significant role in determining how the manned space program was publicly discussed. From the late 1950s to the late 1970s, two broad patterns unfolded regarding the relationship between the U.S. space program and the issue of race. First, both mainstream U.S. attitudes and government policies regarding the space program became more racially inclusive, albeit at an uneven pace. Second, African American attitudes changed from seeking active participation in the American exploration of space to questioning the priority of spending federal monies on outer space rather than on terrestrial needs. Utilizing contemporary media accounts, first-hand accounts, and archival material, including documents from NASA, the NAACP, and the National Urban League, this project analyzes how racial concerns and minority activism influenced the projection of NASA's public image and its internal recruitment policies.",,,
328,Paleoceanography of the Eastern Equatorial Pacific: Insights from a new Carnegie Platform stratigraphic record,"We present new stable isotope and dissolution records for a composite ""Carnegie Platform"" (CP) sediment record composed of KNR195-5 cores CDH-36 and MC-34A (3 35.85' S, 83 57.79' W, 3225 m). Renewed interest in this previously studied Eastern Equatorial Pacific paleoceanographic site prompted a re-coring using the recently developed CDH giant piston coring system. Giant piston core CDH-36, with a core length of 42.61 m, nearly triples the length of previous cores taken at this site. CDH-36 is combined with multicore MC-34A (0.36 m length) to obtain a continuous sediment record through the Holocene into the present day (0 ka). A new age model using radiocarbon dates from both cores and an alignment of the CDH-36 delta 18O record with the LR04 benthic stack (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005) demonstrates that the CP record extends to 720 ka, to the end of MIS 18. Comparisons of the CP stable isotope records with regional Pacific records show consistencies in timing of glacial and interglacial episodes. We also evaluate the %CF ([coarse fraction/bulk dry sample] * 100) record of the CP core as well as the %fragmentation (100*[( frag/8)/(( frag/8)+( whole))]) (Le and Shackleton, 1992) at certain intervals in order to assess dissolution within the CP record. We find that the continuous %CF record primarily records Pleistocene dissolution cycles. These cycles are consistent with previous studies of tropical Pacific cores, such as those of Le and Shackleton (1992) and Lalicata and Lea (2011). There are a number of hypotheses for ocean or basin-wide calcium carbonate dissolution cycles, including changes in terrestrial carbon input to the oceans and in water mass ventilation (Shackleton, 1977; Toggweiler et al., 2006; Sexton and Barker, 2012). Despite the hypothesized Pacific-wide dissolution cycles, there are still clear differences between the %CF records of tropical Pacific cores. These differences likely reflect the impact of secondary processes such as changes in terrigenous input, winnowing away of fine-grained sediments from bathymetrically highs, and core depth relative to the lysocline. Based on comparisons of the newly established CP record with other Pacific records of dissolution, proxy work is needed to address the influence of these secondary processes on the %CF record in order to better quantify the full extent of dissolution and its governing processes.",,,
329,Calibration Systems of the KATRIN Experiment and Systematics Inherent in the Search for Sterile Neutrinos at the keV Scale,"The presence of non-zero neutrino mass is one of the most important discoveries of physics beyond the standard model. Experiments in neutrino oscillation have established the mass splittings and mixing parameters of the (as of now) three known mass states, but the absolute scale of neutrino masses remains a mystery. In addition, evidence has mounted suggesting that the current picture of the three neutrino species may not be complete. The KATRIN (Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino) experiment aims to measure the neutrino mass to 0.2 eV, representing an order of magnitude improvement in any direct measurement of the absolute scale. KATRIN will accomplish this task by measuring the endpoint spectrum of beta decay electrons from molecular tritium. The high precision beta spectroscopy will be performed via magnetic collimation electrostatic (MAC-E) filter spectroscopy. This measurement technique presents several sources of systematic error. In particular, it is of utmost importance that the activity and column density is of tritium is known to high precision. The presence of backscattered electrons also have the potential to alter the shape of the tritium endpoint. This document contains discussion of these systematic uncertainties, along with the design and construction of calibration systems that aim to reduce those systematics. The question of electron backscattering, and how it applies to the KATRIN measurement has also been explored experimentally for the first time. A measurement has been performed using a scanning electron microscope and custom-designed electrostatic spectrometer to measure the energy spectrum of backscattered electrons close to the tritium endpoint energy. An analysis has also been performed to explore the possible systematics originating from backscattered electrons on a possible keV-scale sterile neutrino search. The electron backscattering experiment has measured Auger electrons from gold in the energy range 6-11 keV produced at a rate of 10-4 Auger electrons per incident electron. An investigation of proposed keV sterile neutrino search analysis methods show that this rate of Auger electron production is problematic, and work needs to be done to reduce this source of background if a keV-scale sterile neutrino search is to be successful.",,,
330,Community College Transfer to Four-Year Institutions: A Latent Class Structural Equation Model,"Drawing on data from the nationally representative 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS 04/09), this study proposed and tested a latent class measurement model of public two-year community college student transfer subtypes, and examined the latent class conditional structural relationships among student background characteristics, Remediation, First-year college GPA, Student Engagement and transfer to four-year institutions. Perhaps, most importantly, this study examined whether latent class membership moderated the relationships between malleable factors and four-year transfer likelihood. This study employed latent class analysis (LCA) to identify potential latent transfer subtypes, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to account for the unreliability in the indicators of the hypothesized latent student Engagement factor, and structural equation modeling (SEM), using an unbiased 3-step approach to the analysis of both predictors of latent class and latent class prediction of distal outcomes (Asparouhov & Muthen, 2014a; Vermunt, 2010), to examine the associations among the above mentioned variables and four-year transfer likelihood. Based on a comprehensive review of information criteria and fit indices, a four class solution fit the data best and provided four substantively relevant transfer classes which I labeled as follows: Class 1: High Transfer Intentions, Few Barriers, Class 2: Low Transfer Intentions, Some Barriers, Class 3: Moderate Transfer Intentions, Low Academic Resources, Class 4: Moderate Transfer Intentions, Low Academic Momentum. Controlling for latent class membership, first generation college status and exposure to remediation were negatively associated with four-year transfer likelihood, while increases in both first-year GPA and student Engagement were positively associated with transfer outcomes. However, when latent class specific slopes were estimated, exposure to Remediation and first-year GPA were statistically significantly (p<.05) related to transfer only in Class 1:High Transfer Intentions, Few Barriers, while only First Generation Status was statistically significantly related to transfer in Class 3; Moderate Transfer Intentions, Low Academic Resources and Class 4: Moderate Transfer Intentions, Low Academic Momentum; student Engagement, at an inflated alpha of .10, was statistically significantly (p=.07) related to transfer in Class 4: Moderate Transfer Intentions, Low Academic Momentum. That latent class membership moderated the relationships between malleable factors and transfer likelihood provides underfunded community colleges with a more nuanced answer as to which variables are related to transfer. Using such information, community colleges could provide class-specific advice and interventions, rather than a one size fits all approach, which may or may not be right for each transfer subtype. In this way, community colleges may increase transfer rates in an efficient and strategic manner that meets the needs of its diverse student population.",,,
331,The importance of sub-watershed variability for predicting ecohydrologic responses to inter-annual climate variability and climate warming in California's Sierra Nevada watersheds,"This dissertation improves the understanding of how accounting for fine-scale variability of topography and soil is important for modeling ecohydrologic responses to climate change and variability in California's Sierra Nevada watersheds. In the first chapter, I apply the Regional Hydrologic-Ecologic Simulation System (RHESSys) to eight small watersheds and investigate how the spatial resolution of digital elevation model (DEM) resolution affects the accuracy of modeling streamflow and model estimates of ecohydrologic responses to inter-annual climate variability. Modeled streamflow estimates become worse with DEM resolution coarser than 10m, the explanation lying in the corresponding reduction in the spatial variance of the wetness index. In the second chapter, I use Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) to investigate the effect of soil parameter uncertainty in modeling ecohydrologic estimates in the two small watersheds with different snow regimes. The predictive uncertainty of annual evapotranspiration and net primary production estimates for a transient snow watershed are larger than those for a snow-dominated watershed, but the predictive uncertainty in model estimates for daily streamflow is larger for the snow-dominated watershed. The effect of soil parameter uncertainty varies seasonally, between wet and dry years, and its effect on ecohydrologic estimates is often large relative to the effect of climate warming. In the third chapter, I investigate the different hydrologic responses to climate warming between a snow-dominated watershed and a transient snow watershed. The modeling results show that the snow-dominated watershed has greater sensitivity to climate warming than the transient snow watershed. In the both watersheds, leaf area index and wetness index are primary factors controlling spatial patterns of seasonal evapotranspiration under both of historical climate conditions and climate warming scenarios. Climate warming results in increased spatial variability in monthly evapotranspiration, especially in the summer period. In the last chapter, I develop a strategic sampling design for collecting soil moisture and sapflux data to capture watershed ecohydrologic responses to inter-annual climate variability in a transient snow watershed. The comparison of model-based calculated hydrological similarity indicators with measured values shows that spatial patterns of field-sampled soil moisture data are similar to those of model-based estimates. However, the model fails to capture the soil moisture and sapflux dynamics in the riparian zone site, and in a site where lateral subsurface flow may not follow surface topography. Future research will reduce these errors by the use of finer-scale representations of microclimate, topography, vegetation, and soil properties in the model.",,,
332,Synthesis and characterization of PDMS-based block copolymers toward sub-10nm nanopatterning,"Block copolymer self-assembly has been used as nanopatterning towards applications of lithography for decades. For the purpose of smaller, faster and cheaper transistor developments, block copolymers with high Flory-Huggins parameter and better etching contrast need to be further developed. PDMS based block copolymers are of the most interest among all candidates. I synthesized a library of well defined PDMS-b-PMMA, PDMS-b-PS and PDMS-b-PEO through ""click"" chemistry. The Flory-Huggins interaction parameters of these block copolymers are characterized much higher than conventional block copolymers as expected. Therefore, sub-10 nm domain periods are achieved by these materials in bulk. Significantly, long range ordered nanoline and nanodot patterns have been produced by PDMS-b-PMMA. Furthermore, a small molecule (L)-tartaric acid used as a hydrogen bonding donor was proved to efficiently suppress the crystallinity of PEO and significantly enhance the self-assembly behavior. Finally, the triazole moiety in the middle of the block copolymer which synthesized by ""click"" chemistry was functionalized to produce an ionic junction block copolymer. The electrostatic interactions before the opposite charges act as an extra enthalpy to help the self-assembly. Therefore, order disorder transition temperature of the block copolymer was dramatically increased.",,,
333,Light harvesting through next generation solar cells: Dye-sensitized solar cell and plasmonic solar cell,"Since the use of fossil fuels has caused environmental pollution problems, scientists have been searching for alternative clean energy sources, which include conversion of solar energy to electricity. Silicon-based solar cells have been the mainstream, but their price is still high compared to fossil fuel energy generation. Therefore, next generation solar cells fabricated with higher efficiency, cheaper materials, and low manufacturing cost need to be created. With these proposed criteria, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and plasmon-induced hot electron solar cells were studied and are described in this dissertation. For the fabricated DSSCs, graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) was utilized as an inexpensive and efficient counter electrode catalyst replacing the expensive conventional platinum for standard DSSCs using a triiodide/iodide redox couple, an N719 dye, and FTO glass substrates. In spite of its versatile applicability thanks to the intrinsic semiconducting property and the electron-rich nitrogen surface functionality, g-CN has never been employed as an electrocatalyst in DSSCs, possibly due to its inferior electrical conductivity. In order to address this problem, a conductive material was deposited along with the g-CN onto the cathode and a sacrificial binder was used to ensure homogeneous coating of g-CN and the conductive material. When electrocatalytic performance was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on symmetric dummy cells, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) was found to decrease with a higher content of g-CN confirming its superior conductivity and potential catalytic activity. DSSCs with the g-CN catalyst on the counter electrodes exhibited good power conversion efficiencies comparable to that of Pt. For the plasmon-induced hot electron solar cells, a wholly plasmonic photovoltaic device in which photon absorption and carrier generation take place exclusively in the plasmonic metal was fabricated. Energetic 'hot' electrons resulting from the decay of excited plasmons were extracted using a Schottky barrier to produce the output photocurrent. Its wavelength response tracks the absorption spectrum of the transverse plasmon of the gold nanorods indicating that the absorbed photon-to-electron conversion process was exclusively associated with the Au. The aforementioned solid-state plasmonic solar cell was able to generate power with a respectable absorbed photon-to-electron conversion efficiency; however, high power conversion efficiency was not achievable with a thin TiO 2 layer most likely because of dielectric breakdown. In order to solve this problem, a liquid-junction using a redox electrolyte was employed between the two electrodes. The use of this liquid-junction greatly reduced the dielectric breakdown in the oxide layers that were utilized, leading to a great improvement in the long-term stability of the cell's performance.",,,
334,Systems Biology Approaches to Understanding Heterogeneity in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"In the last decade, high-throughput data has presented an opportunity for great strides in identifying biomarkers, understanding disease progression, and developing tools and knowledge for personalized medicine. The ability to extract multiple levels of biological information, from molecular and cellular level data including DNA sequence, RNA expression, and protein concentration, to organ and organism level data including brain imaging, neuroendocrine and neurocognitive data, provides the opportunity to gain a more detailed understanding of complex disease phenotypes. My research utilizes bioinformatics techniques to better understand development, progression, and treatment for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. By integrating heterogeneous data types ranging from molecular to tissue scales, I seek to better translate traditional signaling and gene regulatory networks results to clinically relevant biomarker panels and treatment strategies. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that develops in response to a traumatic experience. Although the majority of adults have experienced trauma, only a small percentage develop symptoms of PTSD. Additionally, many of these people develop other comorbid diseases, including depression or drug and alcohol abuse. Unfortunately, many do not respond to the currently available treatment options. This lack of recovery may be due to the complexity of PTSD, which is largely unknown. Specifically, PTSD may combine a heterogeneous set of subpopulations which require a distinct set of risk factors, diagnostic markers, and therapeutic targets. Here, I will present a strategy to gain biological insight into development, progression, and treatment of PTSD by identifying distinct biological subgroups of the disease. Specifically, I will use biclustering and dimensional reduction techniques to identify three subgroups from DNA methylation data. Using gene set enrichment analysis and clinical data, further characterization of these subgroups provides links to clinical phenotypes as well as biological function. Finally, I will outline the necessary next steps to implement these subgroup identification and characterization strategies into the overall goal of identifying PTSD diagnostics and therapeutics.",,,
335,"Institutions and Patrons in American Opera: The Reception of Philip Glass, 1976-1992","In the early 1980s, arts professionals from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation, and OPERA America expressed concern with the scarcity of new American operas and the stagnation of standard European repertory. Many believed the solution was to borrow from the vital world of American avant-garde music theater occurring outside of opera establishments, most successfully represented by Philip Glass. This dissertation uses the reception of Glass as a lens to examine the discussion transpiring among members of these arts organizations, showing how the various interlocutors were critical for a sudden flourishing of American opera. I focus on the role adventurous impresarios have played in American discourse about opera, promoting ideological orientations and controlling the resources that sustain artist reputations. I show how Harvey Lichtenstein at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Robert Brustein at the American Repertory Theater, and David Gockley at the Houston Grand Opera challenged the role of opera in American culture, lauding Glass's synthesis of popular and high art. Drawing from interviews and archival materials, this narrative charts interactions between Glass and the network of patrons, institutions, directors, critics, and performers who supported and influenced his work. I examine the meanings these people ascribed to Glass's music as a cultural phenomenon, situating their discourse within the context of the broader issues that vexed American opera. Exploring the activities of arts administrators provides a new entree into the larger world of American experimental music that nuances the ""maverick"" label that has so often been attached to Glass. As I contend, the various aesthetic frameworks that sustained the agendas of Lichtenstein, Brustein, and Gockley were at least as important in shaping public perceptions about Glass as anything the composer has said about himself. Because of these impresarios, Glass's operas became a model for innovation, bringing in record box office receipts and revitalizing American opera.",,,
336,"Global Food, World Music: Identity Formation in Consuming the Other","In this thesis, I discuss the approaches of ethnomusicology and food studies to the interrelated literatures on identity formation, tourism, authenticity, and cosmopolitanism. While the scholarship in these two disciplines may run parallel at the moment, by analyzing each field's approaches to these issues, I gain an understanding of possible points of contact and divergence of the fields. The primary purpose of this project is to provide a basis for potential future research merging the cultural productions and use of music and food. My primary research questions center around how the fields of ethnomusicology and food studies do overlap in theorizations of identity formation, tourism, and authenticity. How might cosmopolitanism be a useful concept in discussing music, food, and identity formation of middle class U.S. Americans? As an ethnomusicologist, what methodologies might be useful in such a project and can food studies offer us new methodologies? In the first section, I compare the influences of formative identity theorists in both ethnomusicology and food studies disciplines, noting the significant contributions of these scholars to both fields in establishing the significance of music and foodways in creating and sustaining group identities, such as nationalism. In the next section, I focus on music and culinary tourism, exemplifying the concerns of each field in terms of how tourists interact with the cultural identities of others, the staging of cultural minority identities, and the constructed values of authenticity. I also provide an explanation of the terms ""ethnic food"" and ""Americanization"", both frequently used by food studies scholars. Finally, I look at the literatures on world music and ethnic cookbooks as a means to explore ideas of appropriation and cosmopolitanism in consuming the other.",,,
337,An Examination of the Influences of an International Teaching Practicum on the Perspectives and Practices of Participating Teachers,"This study examines the ways in which an international teaching practicum influenced participants' perspectives about teaching, learning and schooling, and the ways that these new or changed perspectives materialized in the participants' teaching practice over the course of twelve months. To understand these influences, participants were given pre- and post- surveys that aimed to examine their intercultural competence, and were interviewed at three points in time after the completion of the international practicum. Their TEP supervisors were also interviewed. Findings revealed the ways in which participants made sense of their experiences abroad, and how the program supported (and possibly hindered) their sensemaking. Sensemaking was connected to changes in the participants' global awareness, critical consciousness, self-concept, and empathy. Participants felt that these personal impacts were related to corresponding changes in their teaching practices. They attempted to emulate their hosts, bring global awareness into their classrooms, and described culturally responsive practices and attitudes. Participants also reported that their international practicums influenced their professional marketability, goals, and decisions.",,,
338,"Holocene sea-level, climate, and estuarine stratrigraphy of Baffin Bay, Texas: studying past changes in coastal systems to elucidate future coastal response to changing sea-level and climate","Recent studies along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico document rapid back-stepping of estuarine environments of up to 20 km and 150 m/yr at ca. 8.2 thousand years ago (ka), 4.8, ka, and 2.6 ka. If such rapid changes in coastal environments occurred today along the urbanized coast of the Gulf of Mexico major economical and ecological loss would occur. Of these three backstepping events, only one can be tied to a known cause---the 8.2 ka event related to a rapid increase in the rate of relative sea-level rise. However, the cause of the latter two, the 4.8 and 2.6 ka events are largely unknown. To determine the relative roles of changes in sea level and climate in these two events, paleo sea-level (Chapter 2), climate (Chapter 3), and stratigraphic records (Chapter 4) are presented from upper Baffin Bay, Texas and neighboring playa Laguna Salada. As commonly used high-resolution sea-level indicators are absent from the southern Texas Coast, a new sea-level indicator is needed. I test the use of intertidal microbial mats in reconstructing Holocene sea levels from Baffin, Bay Texas (Chapter 2). The indicative range of microbial mats is +/-0.29 m, much less than the +/-2 m indicative range of typical sea-level indicators currently used along the semiarid Texas coast. The elevations of 22 buried radiocarbon-dated microbial mats plot within error of relative sea-level data derived from the central Texas coast for the past 5.0 ky indicating that microbial mats provide a robust proxy for paleo--sea levels along semiarid and arid coastlines. The high-resolution microbial mat relative sea-level record derived from the tectonically stable central Texas coast also provides a test of recently proposed Holocene Highstands based on emergent coastal deposits in Texas and Alabama. The microbial mat relative sea-level data, similar to relative sea-level data derived from Mississippi Delta basal peats and lower-resolution Texas estuarine bivalves, indicates an ever-decreasing rate of relative sea-level rise since ca. 5.0 ka and precludes the possibility of Holocene Highstands in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Paleoclimate records are also sparse along the southern Texas coast. A new quantitative drought proxy is derived from a transfer function between X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) elemental data from a Texas playa and a tree-ring drought record (Chapter 3). Using this transfer function, a 954-year tree-ring drought record was extended to ca. 3,000 ka. Ba, Br, and Pb were utilized as predictor variables. Machine learning algorithms, utilized to derive the transfer function, had maximum validation accuracies of 94%. Changes in the extended drought record correspond with the timing of the Roman Climate Optimum, Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age, and changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST). Increased drought frequency is coeval with nearby dune migration ca. 0.2 ka, 1.9 ka, and 2.6 ka. The highest drought frequency in the record occurs during the Medieval Warm Period ca. 1.0 ka followed by a decrease in drought frequency during the Little Ice Age ca. 0.4 ka. Increased drought frequency accompanies increased North Atlantic SST since 3 ka. This trend of warm North Atlantic SST and dry conditions over the study area follows secular meteorological observations and tree-ring records. These results indicate that lacustrine derived XRF element data can be used as a quantitative tool to reconstruct past drought records, and that North Atlantic SST modulated drought in southern Texas for the last 3,000 years. Within Baffin Bay, five flooding surfaces making periods of abrupt environmental change, between 1.1--1.0 ka, 2.7--2.1 ka, 3.8--3.0 ka, 5.2--4.9 ka, and 6.5--5.7 ka occur through a time-period of ever decreasing rates of relative sea-level rise and within error of periods of drying in southern Texas at ca. 1.0 ka, 2.6 ka, 3.4 ka, 4.8 ka, and 5.5 ka (Chapter 4). I hypothesize that these flooding surfaces, occurring when sea level in the Gulf of Mexico was rising < 2 mm/yr, and during independently documented drying events, were primarily driven by changes in climate through declines in fluvial sediment supply to the coast.",,,
339,Adhesion beyond the interface: Molecular adaptations of the mussel byssus to the intertidal zone,"The California mussel, Mytilus californianus, adheres robustly in the high-energy and oxidizing intertidal zone with a fibrous holdfast called the byssus using 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (Dopa)-containing adhesive mussel foot proteins (mfps). There are many supporting roles to mussel adhesion that are intimately linked and ultimately responsible for mussel byssus's durable and dynamic adhesion. This dissertation explores these supporting mechanisms, including delivery of materials underwater, iron binding, friction, and antioxidant activity. As the outermost covering of the byssus, the cuticle deserves particular attention for its supporting roles to adhesion including the high stiffness and extensibility of the M. californianus byssal cuticle, which make it one of the most energy tolerant materials known. The cuticle's matrix-granule composite structure contributes to its toughness by microcracking between its harder granules and softer matrix. We investigated delivery of cuticular material underwater, cohesion of cuticle proteins, and surface damage mitigation by cuticle protein-based coacervates. To investigate underwater material delivery, we made cuticle matrix mimics by coacervating a key cuticular protein, Mytilus californianus foot protein 1, mfp-1, with hyaluronic acid. These matrix mimics coacervated over a wide range of solution conditions, delivered concentrated material, settled on and coated surfaces underwater. Because the granules are composed of mfp-1 condensed with iron, we used the surface forces apparatus to investigate the effects of iron on the cohesion of mfp-1 from two different species of mussels and found that subtle sequence variations modulate cohesion. Using the coacervate matrix mimics and, modeling the granules as a hard surface (mica), we investigated the wear protection of coacervated mfp-1/HA to mica under frictional shear and found that preventing wear depends critically on the presence of Dopa groups. In addition to cuticle-derived mechanisms for adhesion protection, we also tested for direct chemical mechanisms by tracking redox in the mussel adhesive plaques and found a persistent reservoir of antioxidant activity that can protect Dopa from oxidation. Overall, the mussel byssus represents an excellent model system for understanding adaptive mechanisms of both underwater adhesives and tough materials and I propose in this dissertation that these supporting mechanisms are intimately linked and ultimately responsible for the durable and dynamic underwater adhesion of mussels in the intertidal zone.",,,
340,Mediating scale: From the cosmic zoom to trans-scalar ecology,"We live in an era of unprecedented medial access to other scales, thanks to advances in digitization, big data, probe microscopy, distributed telescopic arrays, satellite imaging, screen technologies, and visualization techniques. To what extent have the protocols, assumptions, and affordances of these technologies shaped what we can and cannot see when we access the scales they make available? This dissertation examines an explosion of ""scalar media"" in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, from early ""cosmic zoom"" books and films to the current media ecologies of nanotechnology and geoengineering, and asks what role they play in our discursive framings of ecology, technoscience, and the human. Instead of relying upon conventional understandings of scale to characterize the relationships between human and non-human entities, the focus of this study is on the conjoined cultural and material processes that divide phenomena into discrete scales and differentiate matter into new assemblages at new scales. Scale, then, has two faces: On one hand it delimits a theater of action for a given individual or collective subject---determining which objects take on meaning within that subject's milieu---and on the other, scale ""pushes back"" in the form of nonhuman entities that exhibit non-continuous, scale-sensitive properties that irrupt our implicit notions of a continuum underlying the forces of nature or culture. Thus scale mediates between the assertions of material assemblages and the assertions of categorical thought. The great crises of the Anthropocene---global climate change, pollution, species extinction, human overpopulation, ocean acidification, and the displacement of climate refugees, among others---all play out at this defamiliarizing intersection between scalar access and scalar alterity. Within this circuit of mediation our multi-scalar environments are reduced and framed into signifying milieus. As an interdisciplinary work of scholarship, this dissertation discusses cosmic zoom books and films, literary works from the eighteenth century to the present dealing fundamentally with issues of scale and identity, philosophical texts from Democritus onward, popular speculative fiction dealing with nanotechnology, amateur documentary and online media, and theoretical texts in the fields of the environmental humanities, science and technology studies, media studies, and literary studies. By engaging and accounting for scale as both a primary form of differentiation external to the human and as an arbitrary set of size domains generated through disciplinary knowledge production, this dissertation hopes to expand both our operative definition of ""scale"" and our understanding of media to embrace the processes by which new forms are generated in both the material and discursive domains of our milieu. This study thus argues that any attempt to produce a resilient future-oriented ecology must also engage the production of new, trans-scalar subjectivities, and vice versa.

341,Characterization of the contact-dependent growth inhibition system implemented by wall-associated protein A (WapA) of Bacillus subtilis,"Bacterial habitats are usually very diverse and can involve interspecies competition or even competition between similar subspecies since many organisms are trying to utilize the same resources. In the case of kin selection for those of the same subspecies, various methods are employed to self-select for kin including the use of toxin-antitoxin systems, in which all bacteria of the same species in the associated region receive the toxin of interest but those that do not contain the associated antitoxin protein are inhibited by a specific mechanism. These toxic mechanisms include DNase, RNase and pore-forming activity. Additionally, these toxin-antitoxin systems may be deployed by general secretion into the surrounding areas or by means of direct contact, or contact-dependent inhibition (CDI). Characteristic of the various contact-dependent growth inhibition systems found in diverse species is a large toxin protein in which the N-terminal end of the protein is highly conserved and the C-terminal end (CT) is highly divergent. It has been determined that the CTs of these various strains provide the toxin activities of these proteins. Additionally to this there exists immediately downstream of these large toxin genes another gene that encodes an immunity protein. This immunity protein is also highly divergent from other contact-dependent growth inhibitory containing strains, consistent with the idea that they must block activity of the polymorphic CT region of the toxin protein. Thus far, contact-dependent growth inhibition systems have been described in gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, but none have yet been described in gram-positive bacteria. Bioinformatic analysis has identified a locus in Bacillus subtilis that contains two genes that have similar structural characteristics to that of previously described contact-dependent-growth inhibitions systems. In this thesis I now describe a new system of contact-dependent growth inhibition that is present in many subspecies of Bacillus subtilis, which is mediated by the toxin protein by the name of wall-associated protein A (WapA). It demonstrates that the toxin activity of these proteins is found at the C-terminal ends of each WapA, which encode tRNases whose activity can be blocked by a protein encoded by the downstream gene of wapA termed wapI. Additionally, while the N-terminal regions of all wapA genes studied so far are highly conserved, the toxin encoding CT regions vary vastly. The highly polymorphic nature of CTs can also be seen in WapI proteins, which can only prevent toxicity of their cognate WapA-CTs. This toxic activity is delivered in a contact-dependent manner, and the toxins themselves target a different set of tRNA species. Bacillus strains that contain differently expressed CTs create a noticeable exclusion interface when allowed to swarm over a semi liquid surface and meet up with the opposing strain, while the interface can be avoided by providing the cognate immunity gene that corresponds to one's opponent. However, the WapA system does not seem to function the same when competing wild type strains, as WapI no longer shows significant protection from other subspecies, indicating that there may be another toxin system in play. This novel toxin-antitoxin system thus offers new insight into means by which gram-positive bacterial species can maintain homogeneity of populations and compete for resources.",,,
342,Nano to Micro Scale Coulter Counters,"As biotechnology advances, personalized medicine has become one of the prominent trends. It can be briefly described as an effort to provide preventative, diagnostic and treatment measures for health problems implemented on an individual basis. Resistive pulse technique is a measurement scheme that has found a wide range of applications in this field. In this dissertation, research on devices that are based on resistive pulse technique from nano to micro scale are presented. Nanopore sensing, one of the major candidate technologies for next-generation DNA sequencing is an example of nano-scale application of this technique. It is a promising technology due to its potential to provide label-free, robust and rapid DNA sequencing. However, there are several challenges in reaching this ultimate goal. We present an architecture for solving the aggregate base detection problem through ubiquitous, cost-effective CMOS fabrication. We describe the challenges and advantages of this approach. Beyond DNA sequencing, there are many exciting potential applications of synthetic nanopores, such as sizing and investigating polymer based constructs. Due to its well understood properties, DNA can be used to build functional nano-mechanical structures. However, DNA nano-structures usually lack a robust validation and quality control method, leading to populations that are poorly characterized in terms of shape and size. In this dissertation, the feasibility of utilizing synthetic nanopores to characterize a high volume of DNA nanotubes is investigated. Next, a micro scale application of resistive pulse technique for cancer diagnosis is explored. Particularly, Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) have recently emerged as indicators of cancer metastasis. Thus, efficient detection of CTCs can provide non-invasive biopsy, enable personalized medicine and help understand cancer biology. Currently used immunoassay based CTC detection techniques are inefficient and insufficient to classify extremely heterogeneous CTCs such as Circulating Melanoma Cells (CMCs). Cancer cells have markedly different physical attributes, such as size and stiffness, and can be used to distinguish tumor cells from normal cells. We report a micro-fluidic chip potentially meeting the urgent need to detect individual CTCs in a label-free, fast and inexpensive fashion while maintaining cell viability. We present the design, fabrication and modeling of microfluidic channels that enable the classification of CTCs based on their size and stiffness. We use the device was to classify melanoma (MNT1) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cells both alone and in the presence of blood cells.",,,
343,The Contact-Dependent Growth Inhibition Pathways of Burkholderia pseudomallei 1026b and Escherichia coli EC93,"Bacteria engage in social behavior by communicating through a variety of mechanisms. One method of communication is contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI), a phenomenon in which one bacterium binds and delivers a toxin to a closely related target cell, using the proteins CdiB and CdiA. This toxin blocks cell growth unless the target cell contains an immunity protein, CdiI. The CDI pathway is the process by which toxins are delivered and activated, using distinct target-cell proteins such as outer membrane receptors and inner membrane transporters. The first chapter of this thesis focuses on the CDI system from Burkholderia pseudomallei 1026b. We identify three genes whose products appear to be necessary for growth inhibition, and describe a potential CDI pathway for this system. The second chapter discusses the mechanism by which Escherichia coli EC93 binds target cells. Mutations in BamA, the CdiAEC93 receptor, are described. These mutations confer resistance to CDI and block cell-cell binding. Both chapters demonstrate the variety and species specificity of CDI growth inhibition pathways.",,,
344,Effects of Molecular Structure and Processing on Morphology and Performance of Small Molecule Solar Cells,"This dissertation is concerned with the materials properties of conjugated molecules and their application in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) type solar cells with particular attention paid to the role of processing in determining morphology and device performance. Utilizing alternating electron rich and electron deficient moieties in the conjugated backbone results in tunable energy levels allowing molecules to be tailored to achieve desired optoelectronic characteristics. Two high performance materials in particular are studied in detail with respect to their physical and electronic properties. Specifically, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, UV-viable absorption spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction are used to examine the BHJ nanostructure in conjunction with current voltage measurements to elucidate structure property relationships. A series of molecules designed for specific goals such as improved absorption and electronics are also each briefly described. Though none of these materials give high efficiencies in BHJ solar cells compared with the first two materials, these smaller studies help demonstrate the intricacies of controlling morphology and how it can affect device performance.",,,
345,The Practice of Food Sovereignty and Buen Vivir in Ecuador's Sierra Region,"Ecuadorian member organizations of the transnational social movement La Via Campesina won legal recognition of the state's responsibility to guarantee one of their central demands, food sovereignty, or the people's right to determine their agri-food systems and the extent to which this right can be exercised, in that country's 2008 constitution and 2009 food sovereignty law. These victories came after decades of uprisings by rural and indigenous social movements resulted in the election in 2006 of Ecuador's populist president, Rafael Correa, who denounced neoliberalism and made the alternative development paradigm of buen vivir (or ""living well,"" from the Kichwa sumak kawsay) a central part of his Citizen's Revolution. Academic literature in the wake of these developments has focused on the ideas of plurinationality and ecologically sustainable development embodied in the concept of buen vivir (Davalos 2009, Escobar 2010, Cobey 2012, Oviedo 2014), analysis of state-social movement interaction in institutionalizing the food sovereignty policy regime (Pena 2013), and participation in this process by urban consumer movements (Van Ongeval 2012). Nevertheless, research into the praxis of food sovereignty and buen vivir by rural communities themselves remains limited. In order to address the dearth in academic literature on these topics and investigate the gap between food sovereignty in principle and in practice, this project takes an action research approach to investigate practices of food sovereignty in three communities of the Sierra region of Ecuador. Specifically, the questions of 1) how practices of food sovereignty mesh with or contradict state policy and social movement rhetoric, 2) how such practices inform the notion of buen vivir as an alternative development strategy, and 3) the extent to which an action researcher can contribute to the food sovereignty of the communities being studied are addressed. These are addressed via the researcher's participant observation at the invitation of each community as a participant on a multicultural exchange program sponsored by the Quito-based NGO Huayra Causay, for whom the researcher interned for a period of six months. The study finds positive outcomes such as mobilization for grassroots land reform, collaboration with multinational NGOs for targeted investment in irrigation infrastructure and the creation of community governance for its oversight, and partnership with municipal governments to promote rural producer's associations with direct marketing opportunities such as farmer's markets. However, significant obstacles still remain, such as contradictory policy, high rate of return conditionality for state investment, and intransigence of the national assembly in the participatory legislative process for food sovereignty, making the notion of buen vivir a still-distant ideal for the communities studied.",,,
346,Understanding and Engaging Online Audiences,"Social media has turned all of us into potential authors of content. This phenomenon has further facilitated the formation of new dynamic audiences---all of whom center on the data we share. Although there have been several related analyses, most research assumes that the online audience is only an observer. This has led to the design of platforms that are adaptations of traditional marketing tools wherein audiences are surveyed and categorized anonymously and content authors have minimal interaction with them. The types of collaborations produced by such tools are limited. This research recognizes that the internet has transformed how authors and audiences operate. The thesis explores the dynamics of this emerging ecosystem, from authors, who share personal content with friends and family, to citizen reporters who collaborate with audiences to oppose drug cartels. The thesis demonstrates how to incorporate the understanding of these dynamics into the design of novel platforms. The thesis does this via individual case stories of such systems, for instance the prototype system ""Hax,"" which dynamically allows people to visualize relevant audiences for sharing and collaborating, or the tool Botivist, which dynamically recruits and assembles collective efforts with online audiences. The thesis discusses how, together, we can create a future where platforms produce a true symbiosis between authors and audiences to facilitate collective efforts.",,,
347,"Parenting the Transgender Child: Transitions in Gender, Sexuality, and Identity","This thesis captures the experiences and perspectives of a new generation of parents who identify and raise a child as transgender. Drawing on in-depth interview data with 56 parents, who speak to 43 cases of significant childhood gender variance, I explore several dimensions of the trans-parenting phenomenon that illuminate new cultural reckonings with gender, sexuality, the body, the binary, and identity. First, I examine the wealth of interactions and observations parents have with and of their children, through which parents ultimately come to understand their children as transgender. These stories highlight the child-directed, child-centered dynamics of childhood socialization in a new context---gendered childrearing and (trans)gender identity development---dynamics that are the vehicle of trans-affirmative parenting. Next, I turn to parents' and professionals' distinctions between, and sometimes re-interpretations of, ""trans"" and ""gay"" understandings of non-normative expression. I then explore parents' newfound reckonings with non-binary identities and expressions, both practically and conceptually. Lastly, I consider parents' privacy negotiations on behalf of their children, along with their biomedical accounts for their children's transgender embodiment, and the cisgender body logics that undergird both. Taken together, the analyses across these different domains of parents' experiences expose the cultural work that is giving (trans)gendered subjectivities increasing viability and intelligibility at particularly early points it the life course. The research also shows the prevailing constraints that a binary order imposes on more gender-variant and non-binary subjectivities and embodiments, especially for children assigned male and trans-feminine possibilities, as well as the raced and classed inflections of this parenting model.",,,
348,"Of Water and Healing: Ad Mediam and Hercules in the Context of Imperial Roman Expansion and the Provinces, 2nd - 3rd centuries CE","This dissertation presents a framework for interpreting healing sites in the Roman provinces as vehicles for the adaptation, transmission and reception of Roman material culture. Using a wide range of interdisciplinary methods, this dissertation is the first to consider the important role of Hercules at the intersection of healing, landscape, and imperial expansion dynamics. It addresses a number of case studies of naturally occurring thermal mineral healing sites in the provinces with primary associations to the hero-god Hercules, located in Numidia, Gaul and Greece, and Dacia, while examining a wide range of material, including sculpture, numismatics, inscriptions, and small finds. Important for understanding the formation of Roman identity, Ad Mediam -- an ancient curative sanctuary of thermal springs located thirty miles from Trajan's bridge into Dacia (roughly modern day Romania), like other healing sites, supported transprovincial networks and served as important arena of cultural, social, religious, and political transmission in the Roman Empire. Through an analysis of space, dedicatory activity, representation strategies, and the natural environment, past interpretations regarding the significance of material culture in the context of healing sites are here reconsidered. Engaging with later historiography, this dissertation strives to integrate a variety of objects and material culture more typically treated separately in the specialized literature in order to challenge assumptions about the homogeneity of Roman ""provincial"" material culture and to explore the importance of stylistic variety, objects' use values, and the importance of the natural and built landscape in the formation of Roman identity.",,,
349,"American tan: Modernism, eugenics, and the transformation of whiteness","This dissertation explores the emergence of the suntanned white body in the United States between the World Wars and its dual significance to modernism and the eugenics movement. The suntan serves as a revealing lens for examining the nexus of health, class, gender, and race in early American modernist art and visual culture. Rather paradoxically, as Euro-Americans were trying to preserve certain racial boundaries through eugenics, they also experimented with their own skin color in unprecedented ways. Yet through the popular practice of suntanning, Euro-Americans often transgressed the very racial color lines they sought to maintain. Suntanning---a physical transformation whose most visceral form is the visual---has yet to be critically examined as a subject of art history. This study considers the nineteenth-century medical origins of suntanning as heliotherapy, modern notions of the skin as surface in the consumer culture of the 1920s and '30s, and the primitivist impulse of early American modernist artists in their appropriation of Native American cultural references as well as skin tone. I examine a broad spectrum of visual material ranging from travel, fashion, and cosmetic advertisements to Alfred Stieglitz's photographic portraits of a suntanned Georgia O'Keeffe ""playing Indian."" I also assert that suntanning is a visual phenomenon in and of itself, a performative process by which skin changes color and texture and becomes a natural canvas. The tanned white body, therefore, serves as a floating signifier suggesting everything from eugenic health to primitivist desire. This dissertation adds richer dimension to our understanding of early American modernism by exposing the colored side of whiteness.",,,
350,Implementation of Common Core State Standards & the Standards of Mathematical Practices How Can Professional Development Support this Process?,"There is a need for effective professional development to build the skills needed to teach the Common Core State Math Standards (CCSMS) and the Standards of Mathematical Practices (SMP). The purpose of this study was to explore teachers' perspective of the SMP, the implementation process teachers were using for these practices, how they were transforming their teaching practices to match these new requirements and the role professional development (PD) played in this process. Qualitative data was gathered through teacher interviews. Analysis of the collected data uncovered common themes, including positive implementation perspectives and implementation expectations, challenges and concerns. Participants had strong positive feelings regarding the changes the CCSMS and SMP brought to education. They were excited because, even in the early stages of using some of the SMP, they saw positive results with students' mathematical thinking. Teachers also expressed concern with their lack of experience and knowledge of these standards, and the challenges some students were having with these new standards. When it came to PD, participants indicated a need for diverse opportunities to expand their skills regarding using the CCSMS and the SMP in their teaching. These participants felt that PD needed to address their needs based on their level of knowledge and skills.",,,
351,Interactive Latent Space for Mood-Based Music Recommendation,"The way we listen to music has been changing fundamentally in past two decades with the increasing availability of digital recordings and portability of music players. Up to date research in music recommendation attracted millions of users to online, music streaming services, containing tens of millions of tracks (e.g. Spotify, Pandora). The main focus of up to date research in recommender systems has been algorithmic accuracy and optimization of ranking metrics. However, recent work has highlighted the importance of other aspects of the recommendation process, including explanation, transparency, control and user experience in general. Building on these aspects, this dissertation explores user interaction, control and visual explanation of music related mood metadata during recommendation process. It introduces a hybrid recommender system that suggests music artists by combining mood-based and audio content filtering in a novel interactive interface. The main vehicle for exploration and discovery in music collection is a novel visualization that maps moods and artists in the same, latent space, built upon reduced dimensions of high-dimensional artist-mood associations. It is not known what the reduced dimensions represent and this work uses hierarchical mood model to explain the constructed space. Results of two user studies, with over 200 participants each, show that visualization and interaction in a latent space improves acceptance and understanding of both metadata and item recommendations. However, too much of either can result in cognitive overload and a negative impact on user experience. The proposed visual mood space and interactive features, along with the aforementioned findings, aim to inform design of future interactive recommendation systems.",,,
352,The Holocene History and Facies Architecture of the Nueces Bayhead Delta of the Northwestern Gulf of Mexico,"The economic importance of coastlines highlights the need to understand how coasts evolve in response to changing climate. Prior work suggests that many of the estuaries in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico underwent large changes at 2.6, 4.8, and 8.2 ka. Twenty-eight vibracores, eight Geoprobe cores, twenty-eight radiocarbon ages, and twenty-five kilometers of seismic profiles were used to determine the response of the Nueces Bay-head Delta to the 2.6 ka and 4.8 ka events. Within the cores we identified nine sedimentary facies representing five distinct deltaic environments. Within the 25 kilometers of seismic data, we identified five seismic facies that correspond to the deltaic environments identified within the sediment cores. Fifteen sand lobes interpreted to be buried mouth-bar deposits identified in the seismic profiles and cores were used to track changes in the location of the seaward edge of the delta through the middle to late Holocene. Following progradation of the delta at 7.5 ka, the delta underwent two backstepping events in which the delta front transgressed up to 20 km at 4.8 ka and 2.6 ka. Following these two backstepping events the delta prograded up to 20 km seaward of the deltas maximum landward location. During delta progradation from 4.8-3.2 ka delivering 8.3x103 m3/yr of sand was delivered to the delta. During delta backstepping from 3.2-2.6 ka 6.5x103 m3/yr of sand was delivered to the delta. During the last phase of delta progradation from 2.6 ka-present delivering 6.6x103 m3/yr of sand was delivered to the delta. The decrease in the volume of sand delivered to the delta during the backstepping event at a time when the rate of sea-level rise as sea-level rise was decreasing and regional records of climate show drying suggests that the backstepping events were likely driven by climate changes.",,,
353,Total Synthesis of Natural Products Inspired by ortho -Quinone Methide Chemistry,"ortho-Quinone Methides (o-QMs) are highly reactive chemical motifs harnessed by nature for a variety of purposes. Their applications in organic synthesis had been very limited until the low-temperature controllable generation of o-QMs developed by our group. To accelerate the synthetic renaissance for this venerable species, we expanded the application of the o-QM Diels-Alder (o-QMDA) reaction in the total synthesis of pterocarpan family and paecilospirone. Pterocarpans constitute the second largest family of plant-derived isoflavanoids. Their structural diversity, which results from a variety of oxygen and carbon substituents projecting off their central tetracyclic benzopyran-benzofuran core, gives the pterocarpan family a broad range of differing pharmacological activities. In this project, three pterocarpans: (-)-medicarpin, (-)-sophoracarpan A, and (+/-)-kushecarpin A were synthesized for the first time in 9, 10, and 11 steps, respectively. Key features include the o-QMDA reaction to construct the chroman core and p-QM cyclization to furnish the furan ring. A unified synthetic route for most pterocarpans was developed that is amenable to enantioselectivity. The stereochemistry of sophoracarpan A and B were reassigned based on nOe experiments and crystal structure. Paecilospirone, isolated in 2000 from a marine fungus Paecilomyces sp., was the first reported spiro[chroman-2,1'(3' H)-isobenzofuran] natural product. This potential mitotic inhibitor was first synthesized in 2011 by Brimble and coworkers in 19 steps. To access this challenging target more efficiently, our strategy using o-QMDA reaction has constructed the carbon skeleton of paecilospirone in 6 steps. Despite the inability to install the final benzylic alcohol, we were able to advance the material to provide access to des-hydroxy paecilospirone in a rapid fashion.",,,
354,Topological phases : Anyonic quantum spin chains and gapped and gapless spin liquids,"Topologically ordered phases of matter represent a novel form of order that does not fit the familiar Landau symmetry breaking paradigm. One type of topological phase occurs in two dimensional systems of electrons in a strong magnetic field and is known as the fractional quantum Hall state. Such fractional quantum Hall states are known to have low energy excitations with anyon exchange statistics, generalizing Bosonic and Fermionic statistics. When the ground state of the quantum Hall state populated with well-separated anyons is degenerate, the anyon statistics are non-commutative and such anyons are known as non-abelian anyons. In particular, some of the simplest such systems are Bosonic quantum Hall states containing anyons which generalize the ordinary SU(2) quantum spin degrees of freedom. These theories are described by so-called SU(2) at level k Chern-Simons theories, well known from Witten's work on the Jones Polynomial and are called Read-Rezayi states. Here we will investigate the collective phase assumed by a chain of interacting spin --1 anyons in the SU(2) at level k=5 state, which turns out to be the simplest anyonic generalization of the ordinary bilinear-biquadratic SU(2) chain of interacting spin --1 quantum spins. Using numerical simulations to obtain the spectrum of the anyonic chain we will show that when such an anyonic spin --1 SU(2) at level 5 chain is staggered, new phase transitions appear in the phase diagram and that these phase transitions are described by conformal field theories in the universality class of the well studied conformal minimal models which we identify. Because the anyons in the SU(2) at level k phase are deformations of ordinary SU(2) spins, it will also be instructive to review the effect of staggering in ordinary SU(2) spin chains of spin 1/2 and spin--1, and to draw parallels with the staggered anyonic chain. We will also study a model of spin 1/2 quantum spins on the Kagome lattice with an SU(2) invariant chiral three spin interaction on each triangular plaquette which breaks time-reversal and parity symmetry. In the case of uniform chirality, where each triangular plaquette has the same chirality, we demonstrate that this provides a simple local Hamiltonian whose ground state is the long sought-after Kalmeyer-Laughlin state, which is a bosonic quantum Hall state at filling factor 1/2 . We arrive at this result, which we first justify physically through heuristic arguments using a Chalker-Coddington type network model approach, by comparing numerically obtained universal characteristics of the topological phase, including entanglement properties and modular S and T matrices of our model to those known analytically for the Kalmeyer-Laughlin state. The underlying Hamiltonian is shown to arise simply from the half-filled Hubbard model on the Kagome lattice in an applied magnetic field. Therefore, these results set the stage for possible future discovery of the elusive Kalmeyer-Laughlin quantum Hall state in conventional interacting Mott-insulating electronic solid state materials. When the chiralities of the three-spin interactions on the plaquettes of the Kagome lattice are staggered, a heuristic network model analysis as well as results from numerical work on the quasi-one dimensional system suggest that the physical system is an unusual gapless spin liquid which possesses lines in momentum space at which gapless SU(2) spin excitations, known as ""spinons"", reside. Many-body systems possessing such lines in momentum space which host gapless Bosonic excitations represent a poorly understood class of non-Fermi-liquids in which the gapless Fermionic excitations occurring at the Fermi surface of an ordinary Landau Fermi-liquid are replaced by a similar ""Bose surface"" structure of gapless Bosonic excitations in momentum space. We present arguments for the presence of this exotic non-Fermi-liquid state in the staggered Kagome spin model by (i) relating the latter to a ""chiral"" 2-channel Kondo lattice model which is more amenable to an analytic description than other Kondo lattice models due to the chiral nature of the Kondo interaction, and by (ii) analyzing a similar but different system built from Majorana zero modes as opposed to quantum spins.",,,
355,MOCVD Emitter Regrowth Technology for Scaling InGaAs/InP HBTs to Sub-100nm Emitter Width,"By scaling semiconductor thicknesses, lithographic dimensions, and contact resistivities, the bandwidth of InGaAs/InP Hetero-junction Bipolar Transistors (HBTs) has reached 550/1100 GHz ft/f max at 128 nm emitter width (wE). Primary challenges faced in scaling the emitter width are: developing high aspect ratio emitter metal process for wE < 100nm, reducing base contact resistivity rhob,c, and maintaining high DC current gain beta. The existing W/TiW emitter process for RF HBTs cannot scale below 100 nm. Process modules for scaling the emitter width to 60 nm are demonstrated. High aspect ratio trenches are etched into a sacrificial Si layer and then filled with metal via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). Metals with high melting points are chosen to withstand high emitter current densities (J E) at elevated junction temperatures without suffering from electromigration or thermal decomposition and is thus manufacturable. ALD deposition of TiN, Pt, and Ru are explored. Novel base epi designs are proposed for reducing Auger recombination current (IB,Auger). A dual doping layer in the base is proposed with a higher doping in the upper 5 nm of the base for lower rho b,c and a lower doping in the remainder of the base for reducing IB,Auger. Presence of a quasi-electric field (DeltaEC) in the upper doping grade accelerates electrons away from the region towards the collector, thus further reducing IB,Auger. Selective regrowth of the emitter semiconductor via Metal-Organic Chemical Vapour Deposition (MOCVD) is proposed for decoupling the extrinsic base region under the base metal from the intrinsic region under the emitter-base junction, for increasing beta,ft, and improving rho b,c. Carbon p-dopants in the InGaAs base are passivated by H+ during regrowth. Annealing to reactivate carbon induces surface damage and increases base sheet resistance (Rb,sh) and rhob,c. Process techniques for minimizing Rb,sh and rhob,c in an emitter regrowth process are demonstrated and compared. rhob,c of 5.5 .mum2 on p-InGaAs is demonstrated on Transmission Line Measurement (TLM) structures after regrowth and anneal, by protecting the semiconductor surface with tungsten. This is comparable to 2.9 O.mum2 measured on TLM structures that do not undergo regrowth and anneal. Feasibility of emitter regrowth is demonstrated on Large Area Devices (LADs) with SiO2 as regrowth mask, and W cap during anneal. Emitter-regrowth and non-regrowth devices of identical dimensions and epi design are compared. Emitterregrown HBTs yield higher beta of 28 as compared to 13 for non-regrowth devices. Benefits of emitter regrowth cannot be ascertained on LADs due to high series resistance and large gap spacings between base metal and emitter-base junction. A process flow is proposed for scaling regrown HBTs to 60 nm emitter widths. The process incorporates ALD emitter metal technology that is demonstrated in the first half of the dissertation. New epi designs for regrown-emitter HBTs are optimized for maximizing beta, ft. Scaling regrown-emitter HBTs is essential for realizing their benefit over non-regrowth HBTs.",,,
356,"The Use of Emotional Shifts in Health Messages as a Strategy for Generating Talk and Promoting Attitude, Belief, and Behavior Change","Although there is a large body of research on the effectiveness of a variety of strategies for designing health messages, much of this research consists of experimental studies concerned with the immediate persuasive effects of message exposure on isolated individuals. Thus, these studies typically do not measure talk as an outcome of health message exposure. However, research suggests that talk about health messages can influence message effects. Specifically, the nature of talk in response to health messages (i.e., whether it is supportive or unsupportive of the message) and the degree of message elaboration generated by talk have important implications for the effects of messages on attitudes, beliefs, and behavior. Research also suggests that intense emotion plays an important role in generating talk about health messages. The purpose of this dissertation was to investigate the effects of health messages containing shifts in emotional valence on the likelihood of talk, features of the talk generated, as well as psychological and behavioral outcomes, when compared to messages that were singular in their emotional valence. This research was the first to conduct an experiment to compare the effects of two persuasive health messages containing shifts in emotional valence -- from a positive to a negative emotion (pos-neg) or from a negative to a positive emotion (neg-pos) -- with two single-valence emotional messages, one negative and one positive, on outcomes related to talk and persuasion. Attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral outcomes were measured at two time points, immediately following message exposure and again one week later. Information about conversations related to the message and/or behavior were also collected at the one-week follow-up. Emotional shift messages were found to generate more talk than single-valence messages because they were more emotionally intense and elicited greater message processing. These mediating variables were also responsible for the effect of emotional shift messages on persuasive outcomes at Time 1 and Time 2. This demonstrates the potential of emotional shift messages to promote both talk and persuasion. Additionally, messages ending with negative emotion were more effective in influencing beliefs and attitudes at Time 1 as well as generating not only more talk but more positive talk compared to messages that ended with positive emotion. This research also revealed that intention to avoid texting while driving immediately following message exposure had a greater influence on beliefs and behavior at Time 2 than talk. This suggests that the characteristics of talk may be a more important determinant of message effects than whether talk occurred.",,,
357,Pushing the envelope of magnetic tweezer resolution,"The magnetic tweezer is a single molecule instrument that can measure the extension of biomolecules by tracking tethered probe particles. Due to its experimental simplicity and ability to apply a constant external force to probe particles, the magnetic tweezer is ideally suited to measuring single molecule dynamics under applied tension. In this thesis, I push the resolution of magnetic tweezers to angstrom spatial resolution by using a high-speed camera which can achieve more than 10 kHz temporal resolution.

358,Traumatic Utopias: Staging Power and Justice in Black and Latinx Queer Performance,"Rarely spoken in the same breath, the loaded terms of trauma and utopia serve as provocations to rethink how shared histories of struggle call new collectives into being. This dissertation examines the generative tension between trauma and utopia in Black and Latin&commat; queer performance texts from the 1960s to the present. In so doing, it offers a theoretical model I term traumatic utopia, or the use of historical traumas as the raw material for generating concrete utopias in creative and activist spaces. By focusing on what Josefina Baez calls ""that very concrete utopia"", I look to how participatory performance practices do not model a utopian future but actually create the space in which transformation becomes possible. My use of utopia, then, is not unbounded or existential but about discrete settings---in the theatre, in the cultural studies classroom, in the performance workshop structure---that collaboratively enable other visions of collective sociality and healing. Traumatic utopias exist in creative spaces as a site for social transformation through the power of art to expose the root of suffering, not a spectacle of sufferers, to provoke rather than pacify audiences into enacting visions of liberation in their own lives---in ways often illegible to the demands of mainstream representation or state recognition. In the so-called post-Civil Rights era social actors often locate trauma in a static past, and reduce utopia to a fantasy informed by naive investments in change. This dissertation intervenes in cultural and critical discourses of trauma by arguing that remembering and mourning are not incompatible with healing, hope, and transformation. Through interdisciplinary analysis of a rich performance archive, my project shifts conversations about trauma in queer and critical race theory away from a politics of (spectacularized) hopelessness and toward the everyday transformation of social realities constituted in struggle. While never losing sight of the institutional, I pay close attention to the way power operates and circulates between bodies at the level of the quotidian. This project thus bridges the divide between analyses that emphasize the institutional at the expense of the individual and those that romanticize agency at the risk of neglecting the devastating effects of power. That is to say, the critique of institutional trauma and the imagination of liberatory possibilities both provide vital optics for art and activism. Building on Black and Chicana feminist queer traditions of self-definition in the face of trauma, each chapter centralizes social life and spirituality against the grain of a ubiquitous politics of hopelessness---from plays that address Emmett Till's sonic legacy and BlackLivesMatter, explored in Chapter 1; to Black feminist revolutionary theatre, explored in Chapters 2 and 3; to digital activism and tactical poetry along the Mexico/U.S. border, explored in Chapter 4. In addition, an epilogue reflects on the Afro Latin&commat; utopian imagination. The Black/Latin&commat; queer performance literature I close read attends equally to the very real violences and daily lived traumas of imperialism, colonialism, sexism, and racism, and the need for imagining other ways to be in the world. I define performance literature broadly as texts that exist on the page and stage (plays, ensemble pieces, choreopoems and other works that combine dance, gesture, music, and spoken word)---materializing in and between situated bodies. A genre by definition meant to be read aloud and to transform (in) provisional communities, I take seriously the work of performance literature in shaping and transforming reading publics. My reading of performance (as) literature centers the critical methodologies of literary and cultural studies more than theatre studies per se. Pedagogy also informs this approach: I have taught all of the texts assembled here so my readings reflect, sometimes explicitly, how classrooms can operate like theatre spaces. In examining performance texts that generate new social modalities, I remain attentive to each work's reception history and cultural context to assess the stakes of its political juncture. This constellation of works rethinks the discursive limits of trauma alongside abolitionist politics and utopian poetics of social upheaval. Amidst dystopian realities, Black and Latin&commat; performance literature contends with the structural traumas of global racial capital to forge queer networks of creative solidarity that imagine and inhabit a livable social world. Against the colonialist imposition of borders, nations, binaries, walls, and cages, utopian visions activate the abolitionist demands of cultural producers who seek the dissolution of oppressive institutions. In the face of state violence exist possibilities for speaking truth to power, for mobilizing around social issues, and for creating spaces to grieve personal and shared traumas. Performance literature can be a rich site for all three of these aims: the creation of alternative forms of knowledge production, grassroots coalitional work, and community healing.

359,Design of frequency dividers using nonlinear resonances,"dividers are essential devices widely used to transfer energy from a higher frequency input to a lower frequency output in many RF applications. This thesis is focused on design of passive MEMS-based low-power frequency dividers based on the nonlinear response of coupled resonators. Our resonance devices make use of subharmonic resonance cascade, developing a chain of MEMS resonators to achieve a frequency division of 2N. Three types of device structures with different coupling methods have been designed, and the dynamics has been simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics. For the experimental realization and testing purpose, both electrostatic forces and motion via piezoelectric base have been considered for device actuation. Sensing techniques, tuning on the stiffness and fabrication process have been discussed briefly for the purpose of future study.",,,
360,Assessing and Mapping Vulnerability in the California Commercial Sea Urchin Fishery,"This dissertation develops and evaluates a vulnerability assessment termed the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI). The LVI estimates the relative ability of California commercial sea urchin fishermen to cope with the change associated with proposed marine protected areas (MPAs). A key goal in establishing MPAs is to minimize the potential negative impacts and maximize conservation benefits to local fishing communities. However, current efforts to assess the impact of proposed MPAs upon fisherman livelihoods largely assume a linear relationship between percent of fishing area or revenue lost and magnitude of impact to fishermen and do not consider the differential abilities of fishermen to cope with change. The three manuscripts included in this dissertation develop the vulnerability assessment framework and methodology (Livelihood Vulnerability Index), implement and evaluate the vulnerability assessment across multiple scales, and explore how vulnerability assessment scores may be used to spatially weight and thus better represent the importance of fishing areas in marine spatial planning. The major contribution of this research is the operationalization of a method to systematically assess the vulnerability of fisherman livelihoods---an understudied population group. In applying this vulnerability assessment methodology I found that: 1) the historical and current socioeconomic, environmental, and regulatory conditions fishermen experience in a given place predicted vulnerability levels; 2) the use of weights applied to vulnerability measures within the vulnerability assessments did not significantly impact vulnerability scores and rankings; and 3) fisherman perceptions of what factors may be important to measure vulnerability levels may not coincide with the best predictors of vulnerability levels. Furthermore, in applying the vulnerability assessment output (LVI scores) to spatial fishing data I found that: 1) the use of spatial data weights may be negligible if spatial data across fishermen are highly clustered as observed in spatial fishing patterns; 2) it is important to consider the scale of analyses since analyzing data at coarser resolutions may exclude the importance of fishing grounds from smaller ports or underrepresented fishermen groups ; and 3) to suitably address the issue of scale, data aggregation techniques may be usefully applied to better represent the importance of fishing areas from underrepresented fishermen groups.",,,
361,Progress Toward a Quantitative Understanding of Solvent Vapor Annealing for Block Copolymer Lithography,"Block copolymer lithography is being actively researched as a patterning technology to supplement existing 193nm immersion photolithography and enable the semiconductor industry to keep pace with Moore's law. Block copolymer films generally require post-deposition annealing, and the annealing process itself is critical. Solvent annealing is a newer alternative to the incumbent thermal annealing technique and overcomes many of the limitations of thermal annealing, however the fundamentals of solvent annealing have yet to be understood in part because existing solvent annealing techniques are quite primitive. A new controlled co-solvent vapor annealing system was designed and assembled which provides precise and independent control over solvent vapor activity. The phase behavior of a cylinder-forming poly(styrene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) block copolymer annealed with toluene and water vapor was investigated for a range of solvent vapor activities. Thin film morphology was characterized using a combination of atomic force microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and synchrotron grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering. The thin film morphology is strongly influenced by the solvent removal process, and transformations between ordered phases are possible during this step. The domain spacing of the block copolymer, a key parameter for patterning applications, can be tuned from 25nm to 31nm by adjusting the solvent vapor activities during annealing; this represents an increase of up to 40% relative to the bulk equilibrium domain spacing of 22.6nm. The applicability of this technique to the directed self-assembly of block copolymers was demonstrated by tuning domain spacing to control the number of rows of block copolymer domains which pack into fixed-width graphoepitaxial confinement features.",,,
362,Strategies to Produce Efficient Electrocatalysts and Improve Electrode Designs for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells,"Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells are electrochemical devices that convert chemical energy to electrical energy. These devices are attractive alternative power sources due to their compact designs, high efficiencies, low emissions, and low noise but have issues with high cost and low durability. In this thesis, electrochemical and thin-film methods were used to understand the limitations of the electrocatalyst in PEM fuel cells and address the issues that limit PEM fuel cell commercialization. The electrochemical deposition of Pt from a novel plating solution was used to control the proximity of fuel cell electrocatalysts. We found that optimized pulse potential deposition parameters produced a large density of nanoparticles with narrow size distribution (1.36 +/- 0.36 nm) on amorphous carbon supports. This resulted in thin catalyst layers (< 8 microm thick) that contained 93 % less Pt that performed similar to and greater than commercial fuel cells. In addition, pulse potential deposition was used to produce functioning PEM fuel cells by using the Nafion membrane as a template to selectively localize Pt in the three-phase reaction zone. The fuel cell performance of these devices had Pt loadings down to 11 microg cm--2 with a maximum power density of 213 mW cm--2. The catalyst layer was redesigned to improve conventional catalyst layer designs that limited MEA durability. A spin cast thin-film method was developed to produce smoother electrode surfaces that lead to lower resistance, isotropic conductivity, and increased contact area to the Nafion membrane. These fuel cells produced higher power and were resistant to electrode delamination. The catalyst activity and stability was improved by redesigning the support structure via constant potential electrolysis of 4-aminomethylpyridine on carbon electrodes. The Pt nanoparticles that were electrodeposited on carbon electrodes functionalized with 4-aminomethylpyridine had improved size and dispersion compared to a non-functionalized support. The fuel cell performance was comparable to commercial MEA at low currents which contained only 25.5 microg cm--2 Pt less than 2% from the DOE 2020 target.",,,
363,Structural Characterization of Organometallic Supramolecular Assemblies with Complex Shapes by Ion Mobility Spectrometry-Mass Spectrometry,"Coordination-driven self-assembly is a technique that has been increasingly used to generate supramolecular materials for use in various nanotechnologies which require specifically designed cavities and shapes. Ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) provides a method to characterize the shape of organometallic supramolecular assemblies that cannot be unambiguously characterized through traditional methods such as X-ray crystallography or NMR due to obstacles such as insolubility or symmetry between isomers. Here drift cell IMS-MS is used to obtain absolute cross sections of a number of 2- and 3-D supramolecular assemblies, some of which do not have X-ray structures available. Experimental cross sections are compared with modeled candidate structures to make a final conformation or structural assignment. The temperature dependence of the cross sections of rigid supramolecular assemblies was investigated by IMS-MS to evaluate the newly-developed projected superposition approximation (PSA) computational algorithm against the traditional projection approximation and trajectory methods.",,,
364,UV Laser Diodes,"There are a wide range of applications for laser diodes operating at wavelengths below 360 nm including sterilization, water purification, chemical detection, and other industrial applications. Despite the clear market and obvious advantages diodes lasers would have over incumbent technologies, commercially available III-Nitride lasers are presently limited to wavelengths greater than 370 nm. Much of the technical difficulty arises from the generation of defects such as cracks and threading dislocations due to misfit strain. The radiative efficiency of GaN/AlGaN based emitters is much more sensitive to threading dislocation density than visible InGaN emitters, resulting in the need for higher quality substrates and films. With Semipolar GaN substrates we are able to exploit a unique relaxation mechanism that is unavailable for traditional c-plane nitride devices grown on sapphire. This allows for thick, partially relaxed, AlGaN films with defect densities lower than anything previously reported. Using these low defect density AlGaN films we have fabricated lasers in the near UV and demonstrated the potential for much shorter, deep UV devices. However this same mechanism that allows for these relaxed buffer layers also limits the critical thickness of the waveguide structures, resulting in low optical confinement factors. Exotic waveguide structures such as limited area epitaxy and asymmetric relaxed waveguides can be used to mitigate these issues. The low quantum efficiency of indium-free active regions on semipolar orientations grown by MOCVD is a serious impediment to short wavelength devices. It is likely the result of the formation of thermodynamically stable facets that causes the reduction in radiative efficiency. Growth by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) can improve the quantum efficiency of these active regions by kinetically suppressing the formation of these facets. Electrically injected semipolar (202 1) laser diodes grown on a relaxed AlGaN buffer layers are demonstrated. The lasing wavelength was 384 nm. Reduction in the lasing wavelength was not achieved due to the challenges previously mentioned.",,,
365,Between Africa and Islam: An Analysis of Pre-Colonial Swahili Architecture,"This work re-considers current descriptions of pre-colonial Swahili stone architecture by applying formal analysis to structures from the 'golden age' of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and the Swahili heartland regions of mainland Tanzania and Kenya. The results of this analysis are compared to mainstream descriptions of Swahili architecture. They are then used to make comparisons between the remains of pre-colonial Swahili stone structures and those in built environments that are popularly identified as essentially 'Islamic.' This project seeks to generate an updated description of early Swahili architecture while providing a useful case study of Islamic architecture at the margins of the field. The data for this work was attained through a combination of archival and onsite research. The latter was carried out through visits to Kenya and Tanzania over the course of two summers, 2006 and 2009. The analysis is separated into sections focusing on religious, domestic and public spaces that were chosen from a cross section of stone town sites. The findings support that pre-colonial Swahili spaces were designed by and for the local Swahili community. The analysis of religious structures suggests that nine-bay mosques may have had a commemorative function. For larger mosques it is proposed that longitudinal orientation and the visual obstruction of the mihrab by central pillars are deliberate (rather than accidental) features that were intended to emphasize the direction of prayer. The analysis of housing reveals that pre-colonial Swahili stone houses exhibit only minimal degrees of visual restriction: the stringently gendered, intimacy gradient that is thought to circumscribe both social and physical Swahili space was a relatively late development that can be linked to the period of Omani colonization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The late colonial period also marks the earliest evidence of a formal relationship between Swahili stone houses and coastal South Arabian houses. The analysis of public space suggests that pre-sixteenth century parallels between Mijikenda and Swahili urban form are tenuous at best. When these parallels exist they can be ascribed to a shared cultural climate without the necessity of identifying direct links between one or another local groups.",,,
366,"Fitt for Many Imployments: Gilbert Mabbott, the London Press, and the Working of Westminster","This dissertation focuses on the career of Gilbert Mabbott, a little known but influential player in the British Civil Wars of the seventeenth century. As both a newswriter and print licenser, he played an integral role in the development and shape of the news industry during a period famous for the profundity, contentiousness, and turbulence of its presses. By examining his licensing strategies and publication record, I have better defined the nature of censorship and its limits. In the process, this dissertation proves that he was the editor of the radical newsbook, The Moderate. Mabbott's licensing and his stewardship of the Moderate show that he was not a Leveller, but a radical Independent who favored the settlement of England according to the Agreement of the People. His licensing and resignation from the post of licenser illustrate his advocacy for a greater freedom of the press. Mabbott also serves as a telling example of early modern political culture. His work as a parliamentary clerk led to a career as a London agent. Similar to a modern lobbyist, he was responsible for securing the personal and public interests of a wide range of employers, from private individuals to city governments and even the army itself. These various lines of employment challenged traditional authorities, disrupted the patron-client relationship, and ultimately helped Mabbott to break free of the patron-client system.",,,
367,The Influence of Japanese Colonial Education on the Formation of a Taiwanese Identity,"This thesis focuses on the formation of Taiwanese identity under the influence of Japanese colonial education. Since identity is relationally constructed (shifts historically depending on the changing social context and situation), cultural identity usually becomes stronger when a group faces an outside threat. In this thesis, I will show how the Japanese occupation affected Taiwanese self-identity, and how the colonial education changed the stratification of the Taiwan's society, and shaped the thought of Taiwan's educated elite.",,,
368,"Poetical Illustrations: Image, Text, Empire & History in British Literary Annuals","In 1822, just before Christmas, London publisher Rudolph Ackermann produced a beautiful volume called Forget-Me-Not: A Christmas and New Year's Present for 1823. Filled with pictures accompanied by poetry, the Forget-Me-Not inspired myriad imitators, known collectively as literary annuals. By the early 1830s, the Forget-Me-Not and its roughly one hundred competitors---each selling edition sizes in the thousands if not tens of thousands---were given by their purchasers as holiday gifts to friends or family. Despite literary annuals' popularity, which lasted into the 1850s, their peculiar media conventions and contributions to contemporary cultural discourse have not been well understood. This dissertation recovers literary annuals' significance through the relationship between texts and images in their pages. Typically, annuals' editors began with pictures (usually steel-plate engravings), and then hired contributing authors to write poetry or prose to accompany each one. I examine annuals' use of ekphrasis---or in the annuals' terms, ""poetical illustration""---as it is understood in neuroscientific and psychoanalytic studies: as an artistic display of proprioceptive or cross-modal thinking, processes that are central to one's ability to differentiate oneself from others, and which allow for inter-subjective experience as well. I also incorporate analyses of ekphrasis that compare the text's approach to the image with the self's approach to otherness, as well as accounts that emphasize the importance of affect in the interpretation of images. From this standpoint I consider in detail annuals' contributions to two overlapping discourses in early 19th-century Britain: the development of a national historiography that comprehended the increasingly politically-empowered middle class (annuals' primary audience), and the development of British imperialism in Asia, particularly India and China. By looking at topical trends in several of the longest-running literary annuals over time, including the Oriental Annual, Finden's Tableaux, Fisher's Drawing Room Scrapbook, and The Keepsake, I show how the multimedia practice of ""poetical illustration"" facilitated improvisational engagements with historiographic and imperialist discourses. By closely reading several annuals, I demonstrate their social contribution beyond their circulation as gifts. In their unique employment of ekphrasis, they characterized the production of Britain's self-image as contingent, improvisational, and constantly negotiable.",,,
369,Functionalized Mesoporous Silica and Carbon Materials for Fuel Cell Applications,"Functionalized mesoporous silica and carbon materials have been developed as new approaches toward potentially overcoming the current limitations of polymer electrolyte fuel cell technologies. Functionalization of high-surface-area materials is a novel material synthesis method that can provide attractive macroscopic properties that are often difficult to achieve with single materials. Mesoporous silica membranes synthesized by using self-assembly of block copolymers were sequentially functionalized with aluminosilica and acid moieties to yield high proton conductivities, compared to perfluorosulfonic acid ionomers, the current industrial standard membrane, which provides insufficient proton conductivities under low humidity conditions, thus limiting the operating temperatures of polymer electrolyte fuel cells. As pore connectivities of mesoporous silica membranes are highly dependent on mesostructural ordering, mesoporous silica membranes with transient structures between cubic and hexagonal structures were functionalized with aluminosilica and perfluorosulfonic acid moieties, which provide high hydrophilicities and proton concentrations, respectively. High acid loadings, high hydrophilicities, and the robust proton conducting channels of these membranes yield high proton conductivities, which are stable with humidity conditions and are therefore slightly higher (~3x10 -3 S/cm) than Nafion(TM) (~2x10-3 S/cm) under low humidity conditions (80 C and 20% relative humidity). Additionally, improving surface areas and mechanical properties of mesoporous silica membranes were sought to further increase proton conductivity. Water-vapor treatments strengthen the silica frameworks, yielding micro- and macro-crack-free mesoporous silica membranes with increased surface areas (~1,000 m2/g), while incorporating organic materials blended with silica frameworks improves the mechanical properties, overcoming the brittleness of silica materials. Resultant membranes with high surface areas allow for a significantly increased amount of acid moieties (2.6 mmol/g) on the mesoporous silica membranes as well as improved proton conductivities (~5.8x10-2 S/cm at 80 C and 20% relative humidity). Functionalized mesoporous carbon materials were prepared via a similar synthesis protocol to exhibit significantly different material properties, electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic activities, which show promise to develop an alternative to costly platinum-based cathode catalysts in polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Fe,N-doped mesoporous carbon catalysts were prepared from a widely available N-containing organic material, melamine, and iron nitrate salt pyrolyzed within the mesopores of silica templates. Resultant materials exhibit high surface areas of ~700 m2/g, surface N content of ~3 atom%, surface Fe content of ~0.2 atom%, and also high electrical conductivity of ~20 S/cm. Compared to activated-carbon-supported platinum catalysts, Fe,N-doped mesoporous carbon materials exhibit greater oxygen reduction activities under alkaline conditions, established by high half-wave potential of 0.87 V compared to Pt/C catalyst (0.85 V), and slightly lower activities under acidic conditions (half-wave potential of 0.72 V vs. 0.84 V for Pt/C catalyst). Favorable surface compositions have been established for Fe,N-doped mesoporous carbon catalysts by systematically varying surface N species to improve oxygen reduction activities under acidic conditions. Correlation between surface compositions and electrocatalytic activities reveals surface graphitic N and iron species are crucial to yield oxygen reduction activities. The catalysts also show high alcohol tolerance, which allows for improved peak power output from direct ethanol fuel cells, compared to activated-carbon-supported platinum catalysts.",,,
370,"Emotionally Charged: Exploring the Role of Emotion in Online News Information Seeking, Processing, and Sharing","In light of the growing use of the Internet to access news, this dissertation first aimed to explore how message-relevant, discrete emotions (anger, fear, and hope) affect online news message processing, information seeking, and preferences for policies related to news topics. Second, in response to the now ubiquitous presence of social media sharing buttons on major news websites, this dissertation sought to understand the role that emotion plays in the news sharing process, including motivations for sharing and how emotions influence the specific responses that people want to receive after sharing. 452 undergraduates participated in a 4 (Emotion Type: anger, fear, hope, no emotion) x 2 (Emotion Goal Relevant Information: present vs. not present) x 2 (Website Browsing: browse vs. no browse) experiment. On an online news website developed for the purposes of this study, participants were first instructed to read an emotionally-framed news message about texting and driving. Participants in the website browsing conditions were allowed up to 8 minutes to select other stories on the site that varied in their topic and emotion relevance by clicking on hyperlinks. Participants were free to share any story they read with their online social networks. Their patterns of website browsing and exposure times were automatically recorded. Emotional responses, policy preferences, story recognition, and reasons for sharing were measured after the experimental treatment. Results indicated that the approach emotions of anger and especially hope lead to a willingness to stay on a message page longer than the avoidant emotion of fear. However, negative emotions promoted better recognition of story details than did hope. The results also support the notion that discrete emotions differentially affect information seeking consistent with Nabi's (1999) predictions. In terms of news sharing, the findings support the idea that social sharing in public forums should be viewed as an emotion-specific phenomenon as participants were more willing to share anger- than fear-evoking stories and desired responses to shared information differed among emotions. Overall, the findings deepen our understanding of the role that emotion plays in determining how news consumers respond to and engage with content presented on online news sites.",,,
371,Biases against the Advantaged and the Role of Status Legitimacy,"Biases against advantaged groups are rarely examined in social psychology research. The different forms that this bias might take are not well-understood. In addition, predictors of biases against advantaged groups are not well-established. Across three studies, a number of different types of biases against advantaged groups were identified. In addition, beliefs about the status-legitimacy of advantaged and disadvantaged groups were associated with biases against groups. Interestingly, status-legitimizing beliefs about disadvantaged groups were more closely associated with bias than were status-legitimizing beliefs about advantaged groups. Moreover, results from these studies suggest that status-legitimizing beliefs about advantaged groups (relative to status-legitimizing beliefs about disadvantaged groups) require significant cognitive resources and are also relatively mutable and inaccessible. Results from these studies are discussed as they pertain to classic theories on intergroup relations, with an emphasis on how status-legitimizing beliefs about specific groups relate to System-Justification Theory. These studies offer insight into the understudied topic of biases against advantaged groups.",,,
372,Investigation of the Parameters Inuencing Thermal Barrier Coating Toughness Through a Novel Measurement Technique,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are key components of multilayered thermal protection systems for gas turbines. Failure mechanisms often involve the propagation of delamination cracks within this zirconia-based ceramic layer. Increasing the toughness of this layer is an essential element of any failure mitigation strategy. Progress hinges on (i) developing an ability to assess the toughness of TBCs and (ii) cultivating knowledge on how to optimally exploit toughening mechanisms for these materials. Mode I toughness of air plasma-sprayed TBCs can be measured by sandwiching free-standing coatings in a modified double cantilever beam configuration. Quantification of R-curve behavior is straight-forward provided that: (i) the crack tip position can be correctly determined as a function of the beam deflection, (ii) the energy release rate can be calculated accurately while accounting for complicating factors such as the finite compliance of the ceramic layer and transverse shear effects, and (iii) the fracture process zone is small compared to other relevant dimensions. These interrelated challenges are addressed by a combination of digital image correlation (DIC) measurements and finite element (FE) analyses. A key insight in the present approach, which facilitates the extraction of the crack tip location from DIC data, is that the centerlines of the beams experience negative displacements at a characteristic distance, which is insensitive to reasonable variations in specimen dimensions and TBC properties, ahead of the crack tip. Thus, a simple method is developed to determine the crack length from DIC displacement measurements using a fitting procedure with FE results. Applying this methodology to 8wt% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) dense vertically cracked (DVC) material reveals R-curve behavior with steady-state fracture resistance that is appreciably higher than the initiation toughness. Features observed on the fracture surface strongly suggest that a crack bridging and pull-out mechanism, enabled by the DVC microstructure, is responsible for the substantial improvement of the TBC's macroscopic resistance to fracture. There is also evidence of ferroelastic switching, a mechanism reported to provide 8YSZ with superior intrinsic toughness. Contrasting the performance of the DVC coatings to those with a standard ""porous"" microstructure reveals the impact of the bridging mechanism. The efficacy of this mechanism in a material with low intrinsic toughness is investigated through DVC coatings of 20wt% yttria-stabilized zirconia (20YSZ), a composition that does not exhibit ferroelastic switching. Analysis of novel TBC compositions further contributed to understanding of the effect of each mechanism and their interplay. To probe the evolution of toughness during service, coatings that had been exposed to high temperature were examined. While these experiments were not conclusive, this area may be attractive for future work. This research contributes to the understanding of current state-of-the-art TBCs, enabling improved durability predictions. The tools, analysis techniques, and comparisons now available can be implemented as guides in assessing the mechanical properties when devising new coatings.",,,
373,Ballistic Resistance of Ceramics and Ceramic-Metal Systems,"The pursuit of enhanced armor materials and the efficient design of armor systems is required to keep pace with the ongoing development of anti-armor weapons. The objective of this dissertation is to improve the ballistic performance of ceramic armor materials and to identify design principles for weight-efficient ceramic armor systems. The approach utilizes numerical simulations combined with validated constitutive models, including the extended Deshpande-Evans model for dynamic ceramic deformation. The work begins with a numerical study to investigate the effect that design has upon penetration resistance and propensity for failure in ceramic-metal bilayers and trilayers of identical areal density that are subjected to ballistic impact. The results reveal that the ceramic-metal bilayer design offers the greatest resistance to penetration and that the penetration resistance is compromised by taking metal from the rear and placing it at the impacted front of the structure (forming a trilayer). Failure resistance is found to correlate with low relative levels of energy dissipation within the target in contrast to energy dissipation in the projectile. Accordingly, failure resistant designs are found to have large mass ratios of ceramic-to-metal. Relationships between the material properties and the rate-dependent fracture strength of ceramics are determined, which enable the development ceramics with improved ballistic performance through manufacturing. Dynamic strengthening observed at high rates is attributed to two mechanisms that inhibit microcrack growth and thus delay the fracture process: (i) radial inertia-induced confinement and (ii) the finite velocity of microcracks. Two key parameters, the quasistatic strength and the critical strain rate, are determined as functions of material properties. Using these parameters a universal scaling relationship is developed that describes the rate-dependent compressive strength of ceramics in a state of uniaxial stress. The limit to the interface defeat capability of ceramics is investigated under a constant force loading condition. While not observing dwell, we find that below a critical load interface defeat is observed and above a critical load penetration occurs at a constant rate. Suppression of microcracking is found to significantly increase the interface defeat threshold of ceramics.",,,
374,A Way Forward: Social Entrepreneurial Models and Systemic Change in Metropolitan Mexico,"In this paper I explore social entrepreneurship as an alternative approach to solving social problems. I examine how those labeled as social entrepreneurs (SE) define and use the term as well as how large organizations utilize the concept to advance their respective agendas. I compare existing interpretations of social entrepreneurship and the 'Social Business' model advanced by Muhammad Yunas. Furthermore, I take a close look at how location may contribute to a ""social entrepreneurial-ready"" environment by honing in on the case of Mexico's social and economic instability. I also use the case of Ashoka: Innovators for the Public, along with two acknowledged social entrepreneurs sponsored by Ashoka to demonstrate the organizational structure and the collaborative efforts necessary for the success of these social entrepreneurial projects. I conclude by considering the potential challenges for social entrepreneurs and the necessity for further support of SEs.",,,
375,Exploring Transition Trajectory from Quadrupedal Stance Using ZMP Based Bang- Bang Control and Quadratic Programming,"Both quadrupedal and bipedal robots have their own advantages. In order for some quadrupedal robots, such as Jet Propulsion Laboratory's RoboSimian, to act as bipedal robots, a transition motion is often needed. In this thesis, we present a ZMP based bang-bang control method to solve for a minimum time transition trajectory for a simplified dynamic model. Also, we explore two different quadratic programming problem formulations to plan for a fast pitching up robot trajectory from being horizontal in hope that the robot can be balanced when it's near an upright position. We also investigate different ways to improve the speed a body trajectory given a limited physical capability of a robot.",,,
376,The Birth of World: The Spark of Eckhart in Heidegger and Bataille,"This dissertation explores the symbiotic relationship that has developed over the last century between two seemingly disparate discourses: Christian mystical theology and phenomenology. My principal concern is the origin and context of this relationship. How and why have we arrived to a situation where atheist philosophers have found helpful resources in the mystical traditions? More specifically, how and why did phenomenologists, beginning with Martin Heidegger, first engage mystical theology in order to formulate post-death-of-God conceptions of the human subject? Finally, how did Heidegger's earliest French readers---the forebearers of deconstruction and the so-called ""theological turn"" in French phenomenology---accomplish this task in response to his early analyses of the human and its relationship to the world? Answering these questions will help to explain how mysticism became a legitimate philosophical resource for those thinkers who not only do not believe in God, but who are openly antagonistic to such belief, at least in its metaphysical iterations. It will also help to explain how post-Heideggerian deconstructive philosophies became a helpful dialogue partner for those philosophers of religion interested in formulating non-metaphysical theologies by way of engagement with the mystical traditions. In sum, knowing the roots, contexts, and history of the unlikely intimacy of these two intellectual domains will enable thinkers on both sides of the conversation to understand more clearly the stakes involved in theological engagements with post-Heideggerian philosophy and philosophical openness to certain elements of mystical theology.",,,
377,ZMP and Value Iteration Based Planning to Assist Fast Walking for RoboSimian,"This thesis presents a ZMP based motion planning using a simplified model of RoboSimian, a quadruped disaster response robot by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Stanford University that is to compete in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC), along with a method of planning for a swing trajectory for a limb using value iteration to optimize the walking speed of RoboSimian. The ZMP based planning is shown to be difficult for large step sizes because of the joint velocity limit. However, the value iteration for planning a swing trajectory was effective in finding an optimal trajectory which improves the overall walking speed of RoboSimian. Lastly, comparing the two methods, we show that when the joint velocity limit is low it is better to use the value iteration based gait but if the joint velocity limit is increased, the ZMP based method will generate a faster gait.",,,
378,Avian Eloquence in Premodern English Literature,"Medieval and Early Modern English writers consistently affirmed interspecies connections between humans and birds in order to meditate upon ethical approaches towards others, and in order to understand the rhythms of the larger systems (both earthly and heavenly) in which all creatures participate. Building upon recent work in animal studies by literary critics and other philosophers, my dissertation counters the view that early writers used animals only symbolically. Instead, I use close-readings of four key works (the Anglo-Saxon Seafarer, Chaucer's House of Fame, Pembroke's translation of Psalm 68, and Shakespeare's Macbeth) to show how some of English literature's most prominent early texts represent interspecies commonality as occurring at three levels: material embodiment, social experience, and immaterial spirituality. While different writers across this long period voiced their avian characters in various ways, from onomatopoetic renderings of bird sounds to putting human speech in their beaks, a commitment to naturalistic depiction of avian habits is visible throughout. Also prominent is a sense that birds are eerily human-like. Their complex social structures, vocal communication, and song resemble human practices. Birds, however, have something we have always longed for: flight. This makes them the earthly animals physically closest to heaven, granting them a liminal status in which they are both deeply creaturely and also closest to the Creator. I suggest that such poetic renderings become particularly prominent at times of expansion of emergent media technology, because animal communities and communications can become a focus of human nostalgia for simpler forms. They also become sites of anxiety about what is lost---including a feeling of lost ethical virtue---when technology changes the human social landscape. The current animal turn is related to earlier such turns, and all are influenced by changing media.",,,
379,Immediacy In Creative Coding Environments,"We often face impediments to the realization of creative and productive work. These impediments take many forms, social, temporal and technical, and any effort to ameliorate them has the potential to further creative output and afford a more satisfying degree of personal expression. This dissertation examines strategies for removing such impediments by considering immediacy to be the primary concern informing the design of creative coding environments. We examine immediacy as it relates to the execution of artistic works as well as the social aspects of creative production: publication, browsing of prior work, consulting with peers and collaboration. We explore high-level abstractions and meta-programming strategies as a mechanism for simplifying the creation of audiovisual mappings, user interfaces and signal processing graphs in an effort to remove barriers between conceptualization and realization. Although prior literature argues that creative coding is best served by domain specific languages, we argue that our research augments the expressiveness of general purpose programming languages and obviates much of the need for domain specific solutions. We document various implementations of this research and their contributions to a new audiovisual authoring environment, Gibber, designed to improve immediacy in creative coding.",,,
380,Both Sides of the Interface: Building an Education Interface For a Digital Video Archive with an Interprofessional Group,"In 1999, it was necessary to build an interface for the Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive (the world's largest digital video archive at the time) that constituted over 120,000 hours of video of over 52,000 video testimonies of Holocaust survivors, rescuers and witnesses. In order to build this educational research interface, an interprofessional team was formed. Groups of professionals worked together on the interface design process from Fall 1999--Summer 2001 through the Online Inquiry Working Group series. The overarching problem that this dissertation examines is how an organization develops a collaborative interprofessional group to build a public, educational research interface for a large video collection, and in what ways this group influences the design process. This problem was explored from two angles: the back of the interface (the archival system itself) and the front (the interface design process). This study examines the overall 2-year iterative process of the Online Inquiry Working Group series and key moments of interaction within particular Working Groups. Data was gathered from an ethnographic perspective by videotaping and then transcribing the Working Group series and collecting artifacts. A second phase of data collection involved conducting interviews with key participants of the Working Group after the conclusion of the series. These data were analyzed using domain analysis and discourse analysis. This analysis led to three findings. The first set of findings is that preparation for participation is key to ongoing interprofessional interaction. When bringing together more than one interprofessional group to an ongoing interprofessional interaction, complementary preparation for participation is required. The second set of findings focus on issues related to valuing and incorporating the expertise of teachers and education researchers. These findings identified how bringing the educators into the design process in the early stages impacted the usability of the final product. The third set of findings examine what is gained by making the back of the interface visible so that end users have the ability to research an archive and how this process is critical to the support of the inquiry process.",,,
381,Changes in the Indian summer monsoon during the last interglacial: insights from two hydrological proxies,"Most of our knowledge about the history of Indian and Asian monsoons has relied on delta18O records extracted from cave deposits in India and China. While these records are highly resolved and have the most robust age models, the reliance on a single proxy, delta18O, as an indicator of changes in precipitation amount harbors significant uncertainty. This is due to the difficulty in separating the various components influencing calcareous delta18O records. Here we present an independent and spatially integrated measure of past Indian summer monsoon precipitation extracted from a sediment sequence recovered from the northern Bay of Bengal, an area within a runoff-induced low salinity plume. The focus is on the time window spanning Termination II and Marine Isotope Stage 5 (145-70 kyr BP). We use delta18O, Ba/Ca, and Mg/Ca analyzed in tests of the surface-dwelling planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber (white). Comparison of the temperature and ice volume corrected delta 18Osw record with the Ba/Ca record, a proxy for runoff, shows important differences. Consistent with the Kutzbach's hypothesis (Kutzbach, 1981), the Ba/Ca record indicates that strong monsoon intensities correspond with strong northern hemisphere summer insolation with a decreasing trend from strongest monsoon during MIS 5e (~130 kyr BP) and weakest during MIS 5a (80 kyr BP). In contrast, delta18Osw shows monsoon runoff to be comparable or stronger during MIS 5c and 5a relative to 5e. The delta18O-based observation shares some commonality with the results of East Asian and West African monsoon reconstructions. We removed the delta18Osw component related to runoff amount from the delta18Osw record and obtained delta 18Oresidual, which due to the setting we primarily interpret to reflect changes in the delta18O of precipitation (delta 18Oprecipitation). delta18Oprecipitation is significantly depleted during MIS 5a and 5c relative to 5e and enriched during Termination II. Variations in the delta18O of precipitation in the Indian and East Asian domains, likely result from changes in moisture source, pathway, and the seasonality of precipitation. The major result of this study lies in revealing a large-scale imprint in calcareous delta 18O archives unrelated to the amount of precipitation and establishing an independent record of ISM precipitation during the last interglacial.",,,
382,Voice and Valency in San Luis Potosi Huasteco,"This thesis presents an analysis of the system of transitivity, voice and valency alternations in Huasteco of San Luis Potosi (Mayan) within a functional-typological framework. The study is based on spoken discourse and elicited data collected in the municipalities of Aquismon and Tancanhuitz de Santos in the state of San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The research presented here contributes to the typological understanding of valency and voice, as well as to the better understanding of these phenomena within the Mayan linguistic family. In this thesis a detailed morphological analysis of voice and valency in SLP Huasteco is set forth, together with a description of the intricate interaction between the lexical, morphological, syntactic and discourse level in the expression of events in this language. The thesis distinguishes between the lexical-semantic property of valency and the syntactic-pragmatic property of transitivity, which corresponds to a finer distinction between valency alternations and voice proper, and is reflected in the structural encoding of these phenomena. This thesis proposes a subcategorization of SLP Huasteco verbs based on their morphosyntactic behavior with respect to valency and valency alternations that in turn corresponds to their lexical semantic properties. The thesis considers verb roots and thematic suffixes to be central to the encoding of valency. It presents the encoding of valency alternations with ambitransitive roots as well as valency augmenting suffixes, mainly causatives and applicatives. This dissertation also describes the forms and functions of the antipassive and passive voices, and concludes that the Huasteco antipassive has the main semantic/pragmatic function of lowering the transitivity of the clause, whereas the passive has in most cases the syntactic/pragmatic function of putting the prominent topical third-person participant into the absolutive argument of the intransitive clause. In sum, this study shows that this intricate interaction between different levels of the structure is central to the understanding of the grammar of this language, and that fine distinctions in meaning and function correspond to finely nuanced grammatical forms.",,,
383,Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms Controlling Tunable Reflectance,"Loliginid squid have a unique reflectin protein-based adaptive (i.e., tunable) biophotonic system organized in specialized cells called iridocytes. Reflectin proteins were initially discovered in static iridocytes. In this dissertation I seek to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing the neurotransmitter induced tunable changes in color and brightness of light reflected by adaptive iridocytes. Applications to adaptive optics may be envisioned. I have uncovered salient aspects of this system that allow for and drive adaptive iridescence by making observations at the molecular, macromolecular, cellular and organismal levels in the squid, Doryteuthis opalescens . I dispelled previous misinformation about the unique membrane architecture of the iridocytes and the important water flux associated with color transition. I have further characterized the unique reflectin proteins correlated with adaptive function as well as changes in post-translational modifications commensurate with changes in color. I have explored some of the self-assembly properties of the reflectins. I have also made observations at the organismal level; in particular, the sexually dimorphic adaptive structural color. My studies present insights into the mating behavior of this animal and, more pertinently, open new routes for exploration and understanding of this biophotonic system. I have discovered a new cell type (adaptive leucophores) that function to produce adaptive broadband scattering. This work provides an advanced understanding of dynamic iridocytes and opens the door to potential insights through future work in (but not limited to): bionanophotonics, reversible protein self-assembly, protein phosphorylation, bionanofabrication, membrane organization, protein-protein interactions, and cell signaling.",,,
384,Emerging Methodologies for Interdisciplinary Research Practice,"Media arts practice often includes activities that may be at odds with the goals of empirically-oriented research, such as experimenting with representation, challenging cultural assumptions, and questioning the meaning and impacts of technology and innovation. This dissertation investigates the following question: what methodologies effectively enable media artists to operate both pragmatically and creatively within interdisciplinary research projects? To answer this question, I propose framing media arts activities in terms of the following methodological themes: generation, augmentation, provocation, and mediation. I present a series of collaborative art works and research projects---including Data Flow, Fluid Automata, Information Poems, Annular Genealogy, Natural Material Browser, among others---as case studies that elucidate these overlapping themes. I contend that they more accurately describe the creative activities of media artists, and moreover that they provide an effective way for explaining the emerging roles of the media artist when integrating creative arts practices into interdisciplinary research projects.",,,
385,"Microstructural Transformations in Concentrated, Charged Vesicle Suspensions","Vesicles and bilayer membranes are self-assembled aggregates of surfactant molecules. Charged vesicle suspension-based formulations such as household fabric softeners constitute a multi-billion dollar business worldwide; yet a fundamental understanding of what determines suspension microstructure, and thus product stability, is lacking. Vesicles in such suspensions can spontaneously transition from having a single bilayer membrane to so-called ""onion"" vesicles involving multiple imbedded bilayers. These spontaneous transformations can negatively impact the suspension's shelf life and flow behavior. This work has been aimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms driving microstructural and rheological transformations that occur in concentrated vesicle suspensions over time, and relating them to key suspension parameters such as its volume fraction and the mechanical properties of the constituent vesicle membranes. Such an understanding could allow for better design of commercial formulations with predictable physical and mechanical behavior. In this work, various steps have been taken to characterize and examine the key properties of vesicle bilayers and vesicle suspensions. Using the classical technique of micropipette aspiration coupled with a modified experimental protocol that is better suited for charged vesicles, novel measurements of mechanical properties of highly charged lipid bilayers have been made, and the effect of salt concentration on these properties is studied. The depletion-attraction induced adhesion of highly charged multilamellar vesicles is studied using a new Cantilevered-Capillary Force Apparatus, and direct measurements of hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic interaction forces involved in the adhesion process have been made. Furthermore, a simple dilution method to determine the hydrodynamic volume fraction of concentrated, polydisperse and multilamellar vesicle suspensions has been developed and optimized to arrive at a robust recipe for measuring this key parameter. This technique has been used in conjunction with cryo-TEM imaging to quantitatively follow both the macroscopic and microstructural time-evolution of cationic vesicle suspensions at different surfactant and salt concentrations. It was observed that charged unilamellar vesicles in a suspension can spontaneously deflate and subsequently transition to form bilamellar vesicles, even in the absence of externally applied triggers such as salt or temperature gradients. The results presented herein provide strong evidence that the driving force for this deflation-induced transition is the repulsive electrostatic pressure between charged vesicles in concentrated suspensions, above a critical effective volume fraction. Lastly, the coupling between the rheological behavior of charged vesicle suspensions and the thermotropic phase transitions of the constituent bilayer and its mechanical properties has been examined to discern mechanisms leading to the formation and aging of charged vesicle gels.",,,
386,Physically-Aware Architectural Exploration and Solutions for Heterogeneous Processors,"Microprocessor architectures are evolving at a pace greater than ever before, primarily driven by the rapidly growing mobile industry. To meet the industry's stringent power, performance and cost demands there is a rising trend towards building heterogeneous processors with both CPU cores and off-chip components on the same chip. Multicore heterogeneous processors significantly improve energy efficiency due to reduced off-chip communication and allow for customization of the heterogeneity composition which can be varied to fit a wide range of platforms and workload conditions. A comprehensive system-level analysis to explore architectural solutions thus becomes critical to find properly matched architectures with optimal power and performance characteristics. We observe that heterogeneous systems' behavior becomes increasingly sensitive to changes in the low-level physical attributes---the processor's floorplan, layout, or device technology. We also observe that accounting for physical design parameters can lead to considerably different architectural choices when the application characteristics executed on heterogeneous architectures change. Very few system level analysis frameworks to analyze heterogeneous architectures exist and they do not account for physical design effects. Physical design parameters are usually available at a much later stage in the design process when the parameters are optimized independently of system-level parameters as it is too late to modify the architecture at this point. In this thesis, we develop a physically aware exploration framework and provide several synthetic heterogeneous applications that allow for a comprehensive evaluation of various architectural and physical design configurations under different workload conditions. We introduce several architectures that achieve significant all around improvement in system characteristics that could be attributed to the fact that physical design parameters are considered at the system-level. We show that ignoring physical design aspects leads to sub-optimal architectures for particular application categories. We show that an unexplored potential for performance improvement and significant energy savings exists when pure physical design based alternatives such as 3D stacking and emerging devices like Vertical Slit Field Effect Transistors (VeSFETs) can be traded-off along with architectural options and software application characteristics at the system level. Physically aware system-level models provide vital insights needed to develop and test novel architectural solutions that uniquely exploit features of emerging technologies. We discuss the distinct features and advantages of such architectures which are possible only due to the knowledge of the underlying physical attributes.",,,
387,Numerical Scaling Studies of Kinetically-Limited Electrochemical Nucleation and Growth and the Exact-Lattice-First-Passage-Time Algorithm,"Precise design and control of novel electrodeposition applications require computational algorithms that efficiently and accurately capture details at a large range of length- and time-scales. This work presents the development of the Exact- Lattice-First-Passage-Time (ELFPT) method, an efficient and exact method for the simulation of surface diffusion, nucleation and growth during electrodeposition processes on physical lattices. It is based on the First-Passage-Time approach, replacing the hops of random walks with larger jumps at appropriate times. The method includes a flux of particles onto the deposition surface, surface diffusion of adatoms, nucleation and island growth, edge diffusion of adatoms around islands, multi-layer growth, and the option for heteroepitaxial growth onto foreign sub strates. ELFPT is particularly well suited for simulation of systems with dilute concentrations of diffusing particles. The ELFPT method was applied to model systems emulating the five important categories of electrodeposition: (1) Homoepitaxy, (2) Heteroepitaxy, (3) Multi-Layer Growth, (4) Growth on Monoatomic Step Terraces, (5) Single Crystal Probability in Confined Areas. The five systems were studied for large ranges of key parameters and empirical scaling properties were discovered for several systems. The method was found to be up to 100x faster than KMC under ideal conditions, while simulations of the more realistic model systems were generally about an order of magnitude faster than KMC. ELFPT retains the resolution and accuracy of KMC simulations, and automatically reverts to KMC when diffusion lengths reach the atomic lattice range. The numerical results confirm the nearest-neighbor distribution predicted by point-island theory and we found that in heteroepitaxial systems the nearest- neighbor distribution is primarily influenced by the substrate parameters DS and FS, where DS is the diffusivity of adatoms on the substrate, and FS is the flux density of adatoms to the substrate. A time-dependent intensity parameter analysis was used to distinguish between layer-by-layer growth, island growth and quasi-layer-by-layer growth. Nucleation on stepped terraces occurred only when the width of the terrace was large compared to the exclusion zone adjacent to the step edges. An empirical parameter, Lambda = log 10 (D/F)/log10 r2, was found that can estimate the probability of growing a single crystal in a confined area of given size r2.",,,
388,Surface Interactions in Biological Systems -- Myelin Membrane and Articular Cartilage,"Understanding the surface interactions in biological systems is very important but difficult due to its complexity from various molecules with different properties. Moreover, there are not many researchers studying biological systems at the molecular scale with a chemical engineering perspective. Contributing to the knowledge of biological systems from new perspectives can not only give a better understanding of the biological systems themselves but also possibly help to find different and innovative ways to prevent and treat diseases that are associated with the biological systems. The objectives of this research were to investigate the molecular mechanisms of (i) myelin adhesion, and (ii) articular cartilage lubrication. Myelin, which is a multi-lamellar structure of asymmetric lipid bilayers, requires a sufficient inter-membrane adhesion for stability of the tissue structure. When the structure is disrupted, myelin eventually deteriorates, leading to demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. The lipid composition was found to be a critical factor; even a slight change in lipid composition alters the lipid domain distribution and membrane fluidity, which changes the myelin basic protein (MBP) adsorption mechanism. Abnormal adsorption of MBP can lead to a decrease in inter-membrane adhesion, which could be one of the main molecular reasons for demyelination of myelin tissue. Articular cartilage, mainly responsible for smooth, well-lubricated, and painless motion of joints, is a very robust tissue that can bear load and friction throughout a human's life. Osteoarthritis is a disease where the cartilage malfunctions due to damage (caused by many situations e.g., injury, obesity, and infection), which is characterized by excessive pain. In this study, the hyaluronic acid (HA) trapping mechanism has been proposed which is an effective way for HA to act as a boundary lubricant at a sufficiently high load and shear rate. Also, the importance of HA grafting and grafted HA molecular weight on wear protection and synergistic properties have been investigated. Finally, stick-slip friction has been proposed as a possible cartilage wear mechanism.",,,
389,Analysis and Verification of Web Application Data Models,"Nowadays many software applications are deployed over compute clouds using the three-tier architecture, where the persistent data for the application is stored in a backend datastore and is accessed and modified by the server-side code based on the user interactions at the client-side. The data model forms the foundation of these three tiers, and identifies the set of objects stored by the application and the relations (associations) among them. In this dissertation, we present automated techniques for data model specification, verification and repair. We first present an approach for automated verification of data models that 1) extracts a formal data model from an object-relational mapping, 2) converts verification queries about the data model to queries about the satisfiability of logic formulas, and 3) uses an automated decision procedure to check the satisfiability of the resulting formulas. To improve the ease-of-use for this formal verification framework, we provide property templates for specifying data model properties, which are automatically translated to logical formulas before verification. To further automate the specification and verification process, we present techniques for automatically inferring properties about the data model by analyzing the relations among the object classes, and identifying patterns that correspond to a subset of our property templates. We then check the inferred properties on the data model using our automated verification techniques. For the properties that fail, we present techniques that generate fixes to the data model that establish the inferred properties. We implemented these techniques in a tool for analyzing web applications built using the Ruby on Rails framework and applied it to five open source applications. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach is effective in automatically identifying and fixing errors in data models of real-world web applications.",,,
390,Overcoming Limitations of Poly(Ethylene Glycol) in Therapeutic Applications by Copolymerization of Functional Epoxide Monomers,"Functional epoxide monomers were copolymerized with ethylene oxide (EO) via anionic epoxy ring-opening polymerization to overcome the limitations of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), such as lack of functionality and non-biodegradability. First, in order to introduce multi-functionality along the polymer backbone, allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) and ethylene glycol vinyl glycidyl ether (EGVGE) were statistically copolymerized with EO. Besides the general effectiveness of the anionic mechanism on copolymerizing epoxide monomers, some issues regarding geometric and structural isomerism in the resultant copolymers was unambiguously characterized and controlled. Isomerization of pendent allyl groups on AGE during the anionic polymerization process was found to be dependent on the reaction temperature. The isomerization was therefore controlled by lowering the temperature during polymerization resulting in robust preparative strategies for poly[(ethylene oxide)-co-(allyl glycidyl ether)] (P(EO- co-AGE)) with defined structure and functionality. Unknown comonomer sequence distributions of P(EO-co-AGE) and P(EO- co-EGVGE) were able to be characterized through the development of a novel methodology to estimate reactivity ratios. The measured relative reactivity remarkably contradicted the prevailing understanding of substituted epoxide reactivity in copolymerization. Our findings were supported by both independent kinetic observations and theoretical calculations. Next, for introducing biodegradability along PEG backbone, hydrolytically degradable methylene ethylene oxide (MEO) units were incorporated via activated monomer polymerization of EO and epichlorohydrin (ECH) followed by a simple elimination reaction. The synthesized P(EO-co-MEO)s underwent hydrolytic degradation under physiological conditions at different rates dependent on temperature and pH. The only products of degradation were small fragments having defined molar masses and end-group structures. Finally, using many of our new strategies for addressing PEGs deficiencies, a PEG-based copolymer platform was developed for a targeted therapy application in order to demonstrate the potential capability of our PEG modification strategies. As a polymeric drug carrier, poly[(ethylene oxide)-b-(ethylene glycol vinyl glycidyl ether)] (P(EO-b-EGVGE)) was functionalized to carry multiple drug molecules via enzymatically cleavable ester linkages, and then efficiently conjugated with a targeting nucleoline aptamer. The synthesized aptamer-polymer hybrids successfully performed all of their designed functions: The long EO block provided enough water-solubility for the hybrid molecules to maintain their small size in aqueous medium. The EGVGE repeat units securely carried the payload while the aptamer recognized and promoted internalization into the target cells, and selectively released the drug cargo by enzymatic cleavage of the pendent ester bonds.",,,
391,Thermochemical Design of Robust Environmental Barrier Systems for Ceramic Composites,"SiC-based ceramic matrix composites offer the promise of superior mechanical properties at higher temperatures than the nickel superalloys currently used for structural components in the hot section of modern gas turbine engines, enabling improved engine efficiency and reduced emissions. The hostile conditions within the engine, however, necessitate the use of environmental barrier coatings (EBC) to prevent the volatilization of the protective SiO2 scale. Current rare earth (RE) silicate EBCs effectively control the volatilization reactions but are susceptible to mechanical damage and are not sufficiently robust to withstand the corrosive attack of molten silicate deposits. A systematic environmental protection strategy is proposed to address these protection deficiencies. This approach is intended to improve the intrinsic volatilization resistance of the composite matrix while introducing new materials into the EBC architecture to mitigate the degradation caused by siliceous deposits. The incorporation of Y-bearing compounds to the SiC-based matrix enables the oxidative growth of a Y-silicate scale. The lower SiO2 activity of this silicate presumably reduces the scale volatility. The scale morphology can be controlled by including AlO1.5 to promote the generation of a transient liquid phase. The availability of yttrium at the surface is also strongly correlated to relative hermeticity of the matrix material; less hermetic configurations enable internal oxidation that, while not desired because of the potential degradation of fibers or fiber coatings, promotes the outward migration of yttrium. The initial design of the improved coating system, termed a T/EBC, was based on the requirement to use phase stable, thermochemically compatible materials to meet individual protection goals. Coatings optimized in terms of these requirements were unable to mitigate molten silicate infiltration. This deficiency is related to nuances in the reaction equilibria that render the smaller RE cations (eg. Yb) less effective in rapidly crystallizing the melt than larger RE cations (eg. Gd or La). Regardless of the coating composition, the efficiency of the crystallization reactions is reduced with increasing temperature due to increased partitioning to the reprecipitated Hf/ZrO 2 fluorite phase. Based on this new understanding further improvements to the T/EBC architecture including compositional modulation or the incorporation of additional layers are proposed.",,,
392,A Versatile CMOS Enhanced Adaptive Biosensing Platform for Label-free Single Molecule/Cell Detection,"Genes, proteins and cells provide a wealth of information essential for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Resistive-pulse sensing using solid-state nanopores and polymeric micropores has emerged as a new biomolecule-sensing platform. The technique involves sensing the ionic current flowing through a pore in an insulating membrane separating two ionic reservoirs. The blockage of this ionic current provides information on the length of the biomolecule (e.g. DNA), and physical characteristics such as size, stiffness and shape, (in the case of a tumor cell), enabling label-free detection. This transduction of the biomolecular property to an electronic signature will enable low-cost, high-throughput, accurate and easy-to-use biomolecule detection platform, paving the road to personalized medicine. The realization of such a detection platform will also aid in the early detection of diseases, which in cases such as cancer can greatly improve the survival rate. The deformability of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC), for example, was identified as a novel biomarker and has been proven to be an effective predictor for cancer metastasis. In this work, the existing approaches, challenge and limitation were discussed and investigated. A fully integrated biomolecule sensor platform with digitally assisted baseline cancellation was designed and implemented in a 0.6micrometer CMOS process. The design is capable of sensing particle size spanning from DNA (nanometer scale) to cell (micrometer scale). The high dynamic range low-noise front-end compresses the signal logarithmically and encodes the signal into single-bit stream with a delta-sigma modulator. The baseline information is then digitally extracted and processed using an FPGA. Our proposed design can tolerate a steady-state base- line current of 10 micro-ampere and has a usable bandwidth of 750kHz. Experimental results from a 5kbp DNA sensed using a 5nm silicon nitride pore and mice J774A.1 macrophage cells sensed using a single micropore in a polyethylene terephtahalate (PET) film confirm the versatility of the CMOS sensing platform.",,,
393,Microscale Topographic Influence on Grassland Primary Productivity on Semiarid Hillslopes,"Understanding the distribution of plant productivity is vital for understanding the spatial variability of ecosystem functions. This study evaluates microtopographic controls (1m-12m) on plant productivity on three rolling hills in Sedgwick Natural Reserve, located in south-central California. Specifically I evaluate the relationship between topographic metrics and plant biomass production through space and time. Biomass was measured using destructive harvests and seasonal Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data. Eighty-three 1x0.5m2 quadrats of aboveground plant matter at peak biomass (ANPP) were harvested for the 2012 growing season. For the 2009 growing season, AVIRIS derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to estimate biomass at roughly monthly intervals from March to August. I evaluate whether seasonal changes in growing degree days (GDD) was a better predictor of plant phenological events than cumulative days since first soil moisture increase. To characterize topography, I used a 1m resolution digital elevation model derived from terrestrial lidar data to calculate curvature, aspect, and the Compound Topographic Index (CTI) - an index that integrates the flow accumulation area and slope. Using GDD, I found that ecosystem productivity was not temperature limited early in the growing season. Using webcam images I was able to remotely monitor phenological events quantitatively, but was not able to calculate NDVI because I lacked appropriate spectral bands. Plants growing on north facing slopes consistently had higher ANPP than those on south facing slopes, due to lower temperatures, hence greater preservation of soil moisture. No correlation was found between CTI or curvature and ANPP across the 83 sampled points in 2012, potentially because it was a dry year and there was limited water redistribution to lower positions in the landscape. Although a relationship between topography and soil moisture is probably valid for humid areas, it is subject to considerable variability in semiarid grasslands because during low rainfall years, evapotranspiration consumes much of the moisture that could be available for downslope movement. In these settings it is important to consider the amount and duration of water input as well as soil properties in understanding the distribution of soil moisture as it might influence plant productivity.",,,
394,Failure of Ceramic Composites in Non-Uniform Stress Fields,"Continuous-fiber ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are of interest as hot-section components in gas turbine engines due to their refractoriness and low density relative to metallic alloys. In service, CMCs will be subjected to spatially inhomogeneous temperature and stress fields. Robust tools that enable prediction of deformation and fracture under these conditions are therefore required for component design and analysis. Such tools are presently lacking. The present work helps to address this deficiency by developing models for CMC mechanical behavior at two length scales: that of the constituents and that of the components. Problems of interest are further divided into two categories: '1-D loadings,' in which the stresses are aligned with the fiber axes, and '2-D loadings,' in which the stress state is more general. For the former class of problems, the major outstanding issue is material fracture, not deformation. A fracture criterion based on the attainment of a global load maximum is developed, which yields results for pure bending of CMCs in reasonable agreement with available experimental data. For the latter class of problems, the understanding of both the micro-scale and macro-scale behavior is relatively immature. An approach based upon analysis of a unit cell (a single fiber surrounded by a matrix jacket) is pursued. Stress fields in the constituents of the composite are estimated using analytical models, the accuracy of which is confirmed using finite element analysis. As part of a fracture mechanics analysis, these fields enable estimation of the steady-state matrix cracking stress for arbitrary in-plane loading of a unidirectional ply. While insightful at the micro-scale, unit cell models are difficult to extend to coarser scales. Instead, material deformation is typically predicted using phenomenological constitutive models. One such model for CMC laminates is investigated and found to predict material instability where none should exist. Remedies to the model to correct this deficiency are proposed; the remediated model is subsequently utilized in conjunction with an analytical model to probe stress fields adjacent to holes and notches in CMC panels. However, even the revised model is incapable of capturing the range of experimental behavior reported for CMCs with both stiff and compliant matrices. To ameliorate this deficiency, a new elastic-plastic constitutive model is developed. It extends the deformation theory of plasticity from metals to CMCs, and its predictions of near-notch strain fields in an open-hole tension test compare favorably to strains measured using digital image correlation. Based on these developments, future experimental and modeling work is proposed. With respect to the latter, cohesive interface simulations seem particularly suited for capturing multiple interacting damage mechanisms at multiple length scales in a physically sensible manner. In principle, they can function as virtual tests, guiding both engineering design and materials development.",,,
395,Enhancing Sustainability for Organic Semiconductors,"Organic semiconductors are useful for several industrially relevant, cutting edge products, including display technologies (LED), photovoltaic cells, sensors, thermoelectric energy materials, memory devices and energy storing batteries. They possess several advantages over inorganic counterparts because their chemical, physical and charge transport properties can be readily tuned in a predictable manner through standard organic chemistry transformations. Most importantly, organic semiconducting materials offer the opportunity to be processed via solution deposition techniques, opening the door to low cost, high throughput production methods and integration into a diverse array of products. This dissertation focuses on efforts to enhance sustainability in organic semiconductors through a molecular design and synthetic approach. Chapter one details our research to combine the attractive properties of conjugated polyelectrolytes and narrow band gap conjugated polymers to generate narrow band gap conjugated polyelectrolytes, which were amongst the first examples of molecules combining these structural features, and discusses some of the interesting modifications in optoelectronic properties that were observed. Chapter two describes a modular D1-A-D2-A-D 1 small molecule semiconductor architecture and the structure/property relationships of thirteen chromophores that showcase the utility of this architecture to tailor properties for specific applications. Chapter three extends the investigation of D1-A-D2-A-D1 small molecules and identifies two structural features that enable solution processing from environmentally friendly media, including ethyl acetate and water.",,,
396,Does Signaling Theory Account for Aggressive Behavior in Video Games?,Signaling theory originated in evolutionary biology and explains the mechanisms behind the honest communication of information between organisms. Communication scholars are increasingly turning to signaling theory as a way to test evolutionary explanations for human behavior. The present study tests if receiver-dependent costly signals can be used to predict the moment of aggressive behavior in video game environments. High status (but not high trait aggression) male subjects were fastest to engage in combat against a low voice pitch male opponent - but only when subject skill was high. This result underscores the importance of video game skill as a variable of interest as well as the need for video games researchers to tease out when real-world behaviors map to video game contexts.,,,
397,Coupling between crystal structure and magnetism in transition-metal oxides,"Transition-metal oxides exhibit a fascinating array of phenomena ranging from superconductivity to negative thermal expansion to catalysis. This dissertation focuses on magnetism, which is integral to engineering applications such as data storage, electric motors/generators, and transformers. The investigative approach follows structure-property relationships from materials science and draws on intuition from solid-state chemistry. The interplay between crystal structure and magnetic properties is studied experimentally in order to enhance the understanding of magnetostructural coupling mechanisms and provide insight into avenues for tuning behavior. A combination of diffraction and physical property measurements were used to study structural and magnetic phase transitions as a function of chemical composition, temperature, and magnetic field. The systems examined are of importance in Li-ion battery electrochemistry, condensed-matter physics, solid-state chemistry, and p-type transparent conducting oxides. The materials were prepared by solid-state reaction of powder reagents at high temperatures for periods lasting tens of hours. The first project discussed is of a solid solution between NiO, a correlated insulator, and LiNiO2, a layered battery cathode. Despite the deceptive structural and compositional simplicity of this system, a complete understanding of its complex magnetic properties has remained elusive. This study shows that nanoscale domains of chemical order form at intermediate compositions, creating interfaces between antiferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism that give rise to magnetic exchange bias. A simple model of the magnetism is presented along with a comprehensive phase diagram. The second set of investigations focus on the Ge-Co-O system where the spin-orbit coupling of Co(II) plays a significant role. GeCo2O 4 is reported to exhibit unusual magnetic behavior that arises from Ising spin in its spinel crystal structure. Studies by variable-temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveal a magnetostructural transition and capacitance measurements show evidence for magnetodielectric behavior. The above work uncovered a Co10Ge3O16 phase that had a known structure but whose physical properties were largely uncharacterized. This project examined its metamagnetic properties using detailed magnetometry experiments. Upon the application of a magnetic field, this material goes through a first-order phase transition from a noncollinear antiferromagnet to an unknown ferrimagnetic state. Lastly, this thesis explored the chemical dilution of magnetism in some perovskite and delafossite solid solutions. In the perovskite structure, compositions intermediate to the endmembers SrRuO3, a ferromagnetic metal, and LaRhO3, a diamagnetic semiconductor, were investigated. While the magnetism of this system is poised between localized and itinerant behavior, a compositionally-driven metal to insulator transition, revealed by electrical resistivity measurements, did not strongly impact the magnetic properties. Instead, both octahedral tilting and magnetic dilution had strong effects, and comparison of this characterization to Sr1-- x CaxRuO3 reinforces the important role of structural distortions in determining magnetic ground state. The final materials studied were of composition CuAl1-- xCrxO2 (0 < x < 1) in the delafossite structure. The primary interest was the geometric frustration of antiferromagnetism in CuCrO 2 and significant short-range correlations were observed above TN. The analysis found that reducing the number of degenerate states through Al substitution did not enhance magnetic ordering because of the weakening of magnetic exchange.",,,
398,Networks of Encouragement: Who's encouraging Latino students and White students to enroll in honors and Advanced Placement (AP) courses?,"Using affiliation network data collected at a large high school in Southern California, this paper examines differences between who encourages Latino students and who encourages White students to enroll in advanced courses. Previous research has found a positive association between emotional support and academic achievement, and thus, this study shifts the foci from who informs students to who encourages them. This study also used a new survey instrument, Student Networks of Encouragement (SNE), developed by the author, in order to disaggregate large network clusters (family, school, peers) into smaller roles (principal, teacher, guidance counselor, etc.) that are embedded within these large networks. This study found that on average Latino students and White students have different networks of encouragement. These results provide evidence for disaggregating large network clusters (family, school, peers) into smaller more nuanced network roles in order to identify new network clusters that are associated with diverse student populations.",,,
399,Kinetic Analysis of Organometallic Catalyst Precursors in Solution and on Surfaces,"The rational design of catalytically active materials requires detailed knowledge of the synthesis parameters that affect the nature and distribution of active sites. The goal of my research is to understand and quantify the reactions leading to the formation of active sites in order to control their subsequent reactivity. This study requires both detailed fundamental knowledge of the synthesis parameters that affect the nature of the reaction and experimental engineering skills including several chemical characterization and analysis. In my graduate work, I studied 1) the transformation of organogold precursor to gold nanoparticles, and 2) the reaction of homogeneous rhenium catalyst for olefin epoxidation. These catalysts have in common well-defined, molecular precursors and the use of kinetics to evaluate the formation of the active sites.",,,
400,Understanding Squid Beak Biochemistry: A Model for Bio-inspired Gradient Material Processing,"Functional gradient materials are used in Nature to mitigate contact damage between two dissimilar materials. A candidate to study such materials are Humboldt squid beaks (mechanical gradient) which are large in size, acellular and sheet-like, allowing for easy handling. Of particular interest with the squid beak is the use of a hydration gradient to form the beak mechanical gradient. Understanding how this hydration gradient is created and results in a mechanical gradient can potentially provide a strategy to reduce contact damage in multi-component assemblies as well as providing a robust and environmentally-friendly manufacturing alternative to energy-intensive composites such as fiberglass. Studying squid beak's hydration gradient essentially means scrutinizing the beak proteins and their post-secretion processing since the gradual distribution of beak proteins is proposed to be responsible for the hydration gradient. Here, full sequences for two families of squid beak proteins are presented and their functions discussed. These were obtained with fast turnaround by employing traditional proteomics techniques together with RNA-Seq, a recent technique based on Next Generation Sequencing. Chitin-binding beak proteins (DgCBP) which are present throughout the beak make up one of these families and were shown to bind reversibly to chitin using a chitin-binding assay. Thus it is proposed that DgCBPs may be responsible for binding chitin together reversibly during the initial stage of beak formation. The second group consists of His-rich beak proteins (DgHBP) which are proteins with hydrophobic C-terminal tandem repeats that include His residues arranged in GHG motifs. DgHBPs are likely to be precursors to the polymeric cross-links that are beak pigments as the GHG motifs in the tandem repeats can be cross-linked by catechols to form His-catecholic adducts, similar to those previously isolated from digestion of beak pigments. In addition, the possibility of DgHBPs coacervates was probed in experiments using synthetic analogs of DgHBPs. Coacervation had been observed in other marine biomaterials and offers an avenue for efficient transport of DgHBPs through the dense chitin network in the squid beak. Results from these experiments suggest that DgHBPs likely formed coacervates when exposed to seawater and are ultimately cross-linked into insoluble complexes by catechols ultimately.",,,
401,Improvement and Integration of Silicon Nanowires for Thermoelectric Applications,"Thermoelectric materials enable conversion between thermal and electrical energy, with applications that include power generation, waste heat recovery, and solid-state cooling. Conventional thermoelectric devices, however, are both relatively inefficient and based on scarce materials such as tellurium. For high thermoelectric conversion efficiency and figure of merit ZT, materials must exhibit a high Seebeck coefficient (S ), large electrical conductivity (sigma), and low thermal conductivity (kappa). While many of these properties are correlated, they can be independently controlled with nanostructures that selectively scatter phonons over electrons. This approach has led to remarkable advances with Si, an attractive material due to its abundance and scalability, where individual Si nanowires (NWs) were shown to have a 100x improvement in ZT over bulk Si from a reduction in kappa. Despite this progress, greater values of ZT as well as devices that consist of many Si NWs are necessary for Si thermoelectrics to be a competitive energy technology. As the Si NW kappa approaches the theoretical limit for Si, further improvements in ZT must be made by increasing the thermoelectric power factor (S2sigma). Electrically gated Si NWs are investigated since field-effect charge carriers have a greater mobility and sigma than those contributed by dopants from the lack of ionized impurity scattering. A semi-classical transport model was used to calculate the thermoelectric properties of gate-all-around Si NWs for a range of geometries and gate biases. Mobility enhancement was found to increase power factor, with a 2 -- 3x improvement over bulk Si expected for 6 nm x 6 nm Si NWs. Sub-40 nm trigated Si NWs were also fabricated on silicon-on-insulator substrates. Gate dependent thermoelectric properties were measured for gated Si NWs with different widths and compared to n-type Si thin-films. Both S and sigma exhibited strong modulation with gate bias, which resulted in a maximum power factor that was greater than n-type Si. Dense arrays of Si NWs are also required for efficient Si-based thermoelectric power generators and coolers. A novel process was developed to pattern and etch Si NWs from n-type bulk Si substrates, which were then embedded in a low-kappa spin-on glass (SOG) matrix. The Si NWs had diameters < 100 nm, a height of 1 mum, and the Si NW array had a high packing density of 15--20%. Thin-film devices were also fabricated with the Si NW/SOG composite material for cross-plane thermoelectric measurements. The Si NW/SOG composite was found to have a comparable S and a 100x lower kappa than bulk Si. Although the Si NW/SOG composite was relatively thin, &ap;30 muW of generated power was measured with a DeltaT of 56 K. This is the first demonstration of high-density Si NW arrays for thermoelectric applications, and a large increase in both power generation and efficiency are expected with thicker films.",,,
402,"Bathed, Strained, Attenuated, Annihilated: Towards Quantum Optomechanics","The field of optomechanics studies tiny devices that can be pushed mechanically by light. It is an extremely promising avenue towards tests of quantum mechanics on a macroscopic scale, by transferring quantum states of light to nano- or micromechanical objects. This dissertation concerns a long term research program to create quantum superpositions of a macroscopic mirror in an optomechanical cavity. This dissertation has two broad thrusts. The first focuses on microfabrication of a new type of device called optomechanical trampoline resonators, consisting of a small mirror on a cross-shaped tensed silicon nitride membrane. Devices have been fabricated with high mechanical and optical quality, including a 300 kHz device with quality factor 480,000, as well as a device of optical finesse 107,000. These devices are well into the sideband-resolved regime and suitable for optical cooling to the quantum ground state. One such device has been optically cooled to approximately 10 phonons. The second major thrust is theoretical. Creating a macroscopic superposition is a challenging problem, requiring optical cooling to the ground state, strong coupling, extremely high optical finesse and extremely low frequency. A realistic assessment of achievable parameters indicates that it is possible to achieve ground state cooling or strong coupling, but not both. This dissertation proposes a new technique using postselection to achieve macroscopic superpositions with only weak coupling. This relaxes some of the required parameters by orders of magnitude. Prospects for observing hypothetical novel decoherence mechanisms are also discussed.",,,
403,"Darwinism and Religion in England's State Secondary Schools, 1920--1980","This dissertation examines the teaching of evolution in England's state secondary schools from its curricular entrance for an elite minority in the 1920s through its spread to the masses over the next sixty years. Historians writing on the teaching of evolution in schools have focused almost exclusively on the United States, where it has been surrounded by creationist opposition and judicial contention. This dissertation is the first comprehensive historical study of such teaching in England, Darwin's homeland, whose state schools also included mandatory religious education. It investigates four important aspects: the expansion and content of evolution in science curricula; how religious education classes dealt with evolution; what role the teaching of evolution played in secularization; and how the English case differed from the American. I navigate England's localized, complex school system, with its highly variable curricula, mainly via external examination boards' syllabuses, textbooks, counties' ""agreed syllabuses"" of religious education, educational journals, and archival records of science and religious education organizations. For English thinkers the debate lay not between creation and evolution; by the late nineteenth century, English clergy had come to accept the common descent of man and animals from primitive forms. Rather the contention among educators centered on evolutionary mechanism, pitting Darwinism's random variation and natural selection against teleological theories of evolution, or those based on predesigned goals and directed change. Was man a cosmic accident or was he created in the image of God? I offer three conclusions. First, English schools failed to give students satisfactory answers regarding Darwinism and Christian doctrine, preferring avoidance, obfuscation, vagaries, appeals to mystery, or reconciliation via non-Darwinian theories. Second, the teaching of the Darwinian mechanism played only a small part in sparking England's great secularization in the 1960s, because its haphazard nature was non-existent or clouded in most students' education before the 1970s. Nevertheless, evolution teaching still significantly contributed to this secularization by conflicting with some students' imbibed Biblical literalism or by offering escape from the God hypothesis. Third, England's state religious education gave rise to science trumping religion while America's separation of church and state facilitated fundamentalist-influenced students' rejection of evolution.",,,
404,Developing a General Interaction Potential for Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions in Self-Assembled Systems,"In self-assembled systems such as micelles, vesicles, lipid bilayers, biological membranes, and proteins, the intermolecular interactions between aggregates and within individual aggregates determine the structures, properties, and functions of such systems. These interactions can include long range interactions, such as van der Waals, electrostatic double layer, polymeric (steric), hydration, and hydrophobic interactions, or shorter-ranged specific interactions such as hydrogen bonding, coordination bonds, and ligand-receptor binding. Understanding of the range and magnitude of such forces, which can be understood in terms of inter-particle or intermolecular interaction potentials, is important for controlling and engineering desired system properties. Two of the most important interactions in aqueous solutions, hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, do not have widely accepted, simple, analytical interaction potentials. Hydrophobic interactions are attractive forces that arise between hydrophobic surfaces due to the inability of water to form a hydrogen bond network near an extended hydrophobic interface. Conversely, hydrophilic interactions (also known as hydration forces) are repulsive forces that occur upon confining hydrated surfaces. In this thesis, direct force measurements between hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces in several different self-assembled systems are used to empirically derive and describe a general interaction potential that can account for the attractive forces due to hydrophobic surfaces as well as the repulsive forces due to hydrated surfaces. The generality of the interaction potential is illustrated by quantitative analysis of several systems, including light-responsive surfactant bilayers, self-assembled nanoparticle aggregates, and silicone coated surfaces. These systems all have a complicated combination of hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic interactions in the presence of other conventional interactions such as van der Waals, electrostatic, polymeric, or hydrogen bonding interactions. It is demonstrated herein that both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions can be quantified with the same general form of interaction potential: an exponentially decaying interaction with pre-exponential factor depending on the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of the surfaces. The hydrophobic/hydrophilic interaction potential allows for a quantitative description of interaction forces between surfaces at all distances that can describe complex structural transformations, unique aggregation behaviors, and adhesion phenomena in aqueous self-assembled systems.",,,
405,Population dynamics throughout the urban context: A case study in sub-Saharan Africa utilizing remotely sensed imagery and GIS,"The characteristics of places where people live and work play an important role in explaining complex social, political, economic and demographic processes. In sub-Saharan Africa rapid urban growth combined with rising poverty is creating diverse urban environments inhabited by people with a wide variety of lifestyles. This research examines how spatial patterns of land cover in a southern portion of the West African country of Ghana are associated with particular characteristics of family organization and reproduction decisions. Satellite imagery and landscape metrics are used to create an urban context definition based on landscape patterns using a gradient approach. Census data are used to estimate fertility levels and household structure, and the association between urban context, household composition and fertility levels is modeled through OLS regression, spatial autoregressive models and geographically weighted regression. Results indicate that there are significant differences in fertility levels between different urban contexts, with below average fertility levels found in the most urbanized end of the urban context definition and above average fertility levels found on the opposite end. The spatial patterns identified in the association between urban context and fertility levels indicate that, within the city areas with lower fertility have significant impacts on the reproductive levels of adjacent neighborhoods. Findings also indicate that there are clear patterns that link urban context to living arrangements and fertility levels. Female- and single-headed households are associated with below average fertility levels, a result that connects dropping fertility levels with the spread of smaller nuclear households in developing countries. At the same time, larger extended family households are linked to below average fertility levels for highly clustered areas, a finding that points to the prevalence of extended family housing in the West African city.",,,
406,Hybrid Thermosensitive Liposome -- Nanoparticle Drug Carrier with Triggered Release,"Four key elements are conventionally recognized for an effective drug carrier: ""retain, evade, target, and release."" Liposomes have been developed that effectively retain drug within the interior, contain a polymer surface coating for extended circulation, and will passively accumulate at the tumor. However, retaining drugs, evading the body's defenses, and accumulating in tumors are not enough. The challenge still facing liposomal drug carriers is initiating and controlling drug release when desired, without compromising drug retention. We present a novel drug carrier consisting of a thermosensitive liposome coupled to a plasmonic nanoparticle. Continuous-wave irradiation by physiologically friendly near infra-red light at 800 nm generates heating localized to the liposome membrane. The heating increases the liposome permeability in an irradiation dose-dependent manner. Liposome permeability is enhanced through the inclusion of a small molar fraction of single-chained lipid, or lysolipid, resulting in rapid release of small molecules. This enables precise control of contents release with low temperature gradients confined to areas irradiated by the laser focus. Critical to this design is the ability to engineer a liposome with temperature-dependent membrane permeability. We describe the role of lipid structure on membrane transition from the less permeable solid gel to the more permeable fluid phase, and tune the membrane to undergo its transition at a temperature slightly above physiological. We demonstrate enhanced release achieved by the presence of lysolipid, and then present techniques for incorporating micellar-forming agents into pre-formed liposomes in order to synthesize large unilamellar vesicles. This gives us two distinct structures of hybrid liposome-nanoparticle drug carrier---small (200 nm) liposomes with nanoparticles tethered to the exterior surface and large (micron diameter) liposomes with nanoparticles encapsulated within the interior. We attach either hollow gold nanoshells or copper (II) sulfide nanoparticles to the liposome carrier, and then demonstrate rapid and controllable contents release due to the interconversion of light into heat by the nanoparticles. We further demonstrate release in response to localized nanoparticle heating, freeing the system from relying on regional hyperthermia. Finally, we use this system to deliver a common anticancer drug, doxorubicin, to prostate cancer cells in vitro and demonstrate enhanced cell killing.",,,
407,Investigation of Interleukin-13 and STAT6 Transcription Factor Signaling in Polycystic Kidney Disease,"Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) affects over 600,000 individuals in the United States and accounts for 5--10% of end-stage renal disease. Currently, there are no preventative treatments. 85% of the ADPKD patients have mutations in the gene polycystin-1 (PC1), which we have previously shown to interact with the protein signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6. Here we show that STAT6 is activated in cystic epithelia from mouse models, that STAT6 is part of a positive feedback loop, and that genetic removal or pharmacological inhibition of STAT6 reduces disease. Interleukin-13 (IL13), which we found highly expressed in cyst fluid, is sufficient to induce expression of several genes, including periostin, galectin-3 and IL24 in kidney epithelial cells, with STAT6 being necessary for periostin expression. Inhibition of IL13 or the IL13 receptor using protein compounds proved unsuccessful in decreasing disease, most likely due to their inability to access the cystic space. A potential solution is to exploit...(embargoed)...therapies may not.",,,
408,"Democratization, Civil Society, Human Rights Implications, and the State-Society Balance in Armenia","The relationship between the government, international institutions and the civil society sector in Armenia, as in many other post-communist states that became independent with the fall of Soviet Union, reveals some unexpected outcomes of democracy promotion and raises new and interesting questions about the prospects for democratization within such states' typically autocratic and semi-authoritarian systems. In the 1990s, when USSR split into newly independent, officially democratic states, many observers rather optimistically held up these small, politically weak republics to serve as promising test grounds for potential best practices from Western norm-exporting institutions as well as aid programs also largely designed to support the development of democratic governance and market economies. On the institutional level, the European Union (the ""EU""), over time, has garnered recognition and some praise as a successful agent of democratization in third countries. Perhaps EU's most notable achievements so far, the 1980s transitions of Greece, Spain and Portugal coupled with the most recent successful advancements in the Eastern post-communist space, have given it grounds to proclaim its success and universalize this approach with regards to all subsequent post-communist cases . The European Neighborhood Policy (the ""ENP"") and the European Partnership (EaP) are EU's modern `vehicles' for normative transfer. Through these relatively new programs, the EU attaches incentives for successful political and economic reform and a transfer of norms though increasing and deepening interaction with domestic actors. In particular, the EU's interaction with domestic civil society organizations (""CSOs"") and the confluence of these CSOs with the semi-authoritarian Armenian state and other non-state actors, such as the large Armenian Diaspora, present a rich phenomenon to examine. In my thesis, I argue that the policies employed by the ENP and the EaP are insufficient and incongruent in context of the Armenian state and civil society organizations. Further, using a case study involving an Armenian democratically minded NGO and an analysis of the successes and failures of its diverse civic initiatives targeting state violations of human and civil rights, I demonstrate the anemic nature of the proliferating, yet utterly ineffective Armenian civil society. Ultimately, my research suggests that the chances of developing a stronger Armenian civil society as well as the potential for Armenia's democratization in general, can be markedly improved with the help of a more proactive, inclusive, and punitive as well as rewarding EU.",,,
409,The College Readiness and College Outcomes of White and Latino Students: An Invariance Testing Approach,"It has long been documented that not all students succeed in college despite being identified college-ready by college admission. Possibly, traditional measures of college readiness, such as class rank and scores on generally accepted standardized exams, fail to adequately represent the knowledge, skills, and attributes that are required by students to realize college graduation. Furthermore, gaps in postsecondary outcomes between White and Latino students are well-known and are persistent even when comparisons are kept within one postsecondary level. Conceivably, the differences in home backgrounds and high school environments experienced by Latino and White students distinctively influence their college readiness. Utilizing a national representative sample (ELS: 2002), this two-study research attempted to compare White and Latino students on: (1) college readiness means, (2) college outcomes as predicted by college readiness, and (3) student and high school background factors contributing to students' readiness for college. At the core of the research, college readiness was conceptualized as a multifaceted, second-order factor, and the measurement and structural parameters of the model were tested for their invariance across groups. Results indicated that the measurement model was not invariant across subgroups. Therefore, Latinos and Whites were not compared on their college readiness means. Nevertheless, differences were noted in the means of the first-order factors, almost exclusively against the Latino students, suggesting Latino students fall short on some college-relevant competencies. Expectedly, Latinos were more likely than Whites to not advance their education beyond high school, and Whites were more likely to attend 4-year colleges (Study 1). Nonetheless, despite their allegedly lesser capacity, Latinos' patterns of persistence into the second year at 4-year institutions were comparable to those of Whites (Study 2). Differences were noted in the contribution of various background factors to the two groups' college readiness. In conclusion, strengthening the college expectations of Latino students and improving the high schools they attend may help increase their participation in the postsecondary system. Furthermore, developing and validating a comprehensive measure of college readiness and implementing such a measure as a formative tool in schools may facilitate students' advancement toward college readiness and meaningfully increase successful postsecondary participation.",,,
410,"Design and Epitaxial Growth of Ultra-scaled N-polar GaN/(In, Al, Ga) N HEMTs by Metal Organic Chemical Deposition and Device Characterization","It is well known that GaN HEMTs are excellent candidates for high-speed, high-power applications because of the large band gap and relatively high electron velocity of GaN-based materials. The emerging N-polar HEMTs have been shown to be an attractive alternative to developing high-frequency GaN HEMTs with the following advantages over Ga-polar HEMTs: (a) the existence of a natural back barrier increases electron confinement, (b) very low contact resistances can be achieved to the 2DEG, and (c) aggressive scaling of both the gate-barrier and channel thicknesses while maintaining high charge in the channel from the polarization electrostatics of the back-barrier is possible, because of the independence of charge inducing layer and gating barrier layer. To achieve high current-gain (fT) and maximum oscillation frequencies (fmax), the gate length has been aggressively scaled down to 20-nm. For the sub 100-nm gate length HEMTs, scaling down the channel-thickness (tch) in GaN/(In,Al,Ga)N high-electron-mobility-transistors(HEMTs) is essential to eliminating short-channel effects. However, this scaling can degrade both charge density (ns) and mobility (micro), thereby reducing channel-conductivity. The epitaxial design and growth of ultra-scaled N-polar GaN/(Al, In, Ga)N HEMTs has not been explored yet for achieving high frequency and RF power performance. The object of this work is to develop epitaxial structures with scaled channel thickness (_ 10-nm) and high channel conductivity, as well as low gate leakage and high breakdown voltage, using metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. A combinational back barrier design with both AlGaN and InAlN materials was proposed to retain high channel conductivity for ultra-scaled channel thicknesses. With the back barrier design of AlN/InAlN/AlGaN, sheet resistance of ~230 ohm/sqr; and mobility ~1400 cm2/V-s were obtained for devices with 5-nm-thick channel. The fabricated sub-100nm T-gate HEMTs (By Dr. Dan Denninghoff) exhibited Ion of 4A/mm, peak gm of 1887 mS/mm, fT and fmax of 201GHz, 406GHz respectively. Furthermore, the back barrier design space for achieving high channel conductivity with tch<5-nm was investigated. By implementing indium compositional-grading (from In0.18Al0.82Nto AlN), low sheet-resistance of 329 ohm/sqr; was demonstrated for a HEMT with 3-nm-thick-channel. The second main part of this thesis is to solve the very negative pinch-off voltage and high gate leakage problems in the SiNx capped first generation N-polar InAlN HEMTs. A thin InAlN cap layer on top of the GaN channel layer was employed for reducing gate leakage and improving breakdown voltage. Using this technique, devices with breakdown voltages up to 500 V were obtained. In addition, microwave power result for N-polar InAlN/GaN HEMTs was obtained for the first time. The stability of InAlN cap layer and AlGaN cap layer was compared under high field stress. A gate-degradation was observed in the devices with InAlN cap. In contrast, the devices with AlGaN cap layer exhibited better stability under high field stress. The behavior of vertical channel scaling with AlGaN cap layer was then investigated. 3-nm-thick channel with high Al composition AlGaN cap was developed for sub 100-nm gate RF power HEMTs. Additionally, the atomic structure and Ga-unintentional incorporation of AlN interlayer were studied. The growth strategy for high Al-content AlN was discussed.",,,
411,Structure-property relationships in a polymer memristor,"It has recently been shown that blends of semiconducting and ferroelectric polymers exhibit memristance, a property by which the resistance of a material can be reversibly switched between states purely as a function of its electrical history. While devices with relatively good memory retention times, cycle lifetimes, and on-off ratios have been made from poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) blended with poly(vinylidene fluoride-ran-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)), the morphology of such blends is composed of large, irregular domains of P3HT. These large domains represent a significant waste of material, as the memristive effect is believed to only arise at the interfaces of the domains, not in their cores. We show that, through the application of knowledge of how more conventional polymers interact in blends, we can control the morphology of these memristive devices through materials selection and potentially improve device performance as well as provide an additional means of optimization through morphological control. Through electrical characterization in a vacuum probe station and use of atomic force microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, we show that we can smoothly alter morphology in a blended polymer memristor and that these memristors demonstrate switching with on-off current ratios of up to 100 and shelf lives of at least 18 months in atmosphere.",,,
412,Insights into Protein-Protein Interactions within the Bacterial Flagellar Motor C-Ring,"The cytoplasmic ring (C-ring) of the flagellar motor consists of three proteins: FliG, FliM, and FliN, each present in different copy numbers. These proteins perform the function of transmitting torque from the stators to the basal body, as well as regulating the rotational direction of the flagellum. Despite decades of study and great progress towards the understanding of the molecular details of the flagellum's mode of action, substantial questions still remain about its detailed architecture and molecular mechanisms. Here we describe a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments designed to provide insight into the structure of the flagellar C-ring. We begin this work by presenting a background of the forms of cellular motility and provide context for the flagellum within the great diversity of motility mechanisms. We then summarize the bacterial chemotaxis signal transduction system, one of the most deeply characterized signaling pathways within biology. Lastly we introduce the flagellum with a focus on C-ring structure and function. The research portion begins with a characterization of the interaction between the FliG N-terminal domain (FliGN) and the C-terminal region of the flagellar membrane protein FliF (FliFC). We find that these two proteins interact strongly and that this interaction causes widespread conformational changes throughout FliGN. Based on NMR and other biophysical data we propose a binding site for FliFC centered on helix 1 of FliGN. In the next section we further characterize the interaction between FliF C and FliGN. We generate a fusion FliFC-FliG N polypeptide and characterize this complex. Using spin labeling experiments we confirm our predicted interaction site between FliFC and FliG N. We also identify a novel interaction between an important hydrophobic patch on the FliGNM linker and FliGN. Next we study and characterize the domain architecture of the full-length FliGNMC protein. By evaluating pair-wise domain interactions and comparing NMR spectra of numerous FliG constructs, in combination with in vivo experiments, we provide evidence that the FliG middle- (FliGM) and C-terminal (FliGC) domains interact in an intra-protomer manner. This model is in excellent accord with the 3D structure of the Salmonella typhimurium C-ring as derived from cryo-EM. Lastly, we describe a number of experiments probing complex formation between FliG, FliM and FliN, with the aim of determining how these interactions are modulated by CheY binding.",,,
413,Improved orientation estimation for smart phone indoor localization,"The use of commercial Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) within navigation filter applications has seen a steady increase with the large growth of the smart phone market. Unfortunately, the IMUs utilized within mobile phones tend to be highly inaccurate and susceptible to large amounts of noise and bias. Indoor locations in particular are well known to poses various sources of magnetic interference which can cause magnetometer readings to be inaccurate at best. To counteract this, IMU based navigation systems often take advantage of application-specific characteristics to reduce the effects of noise on the resulting filter. In this paper, an application-specific navigation filter is presented specifically for indoor environments that reduce the dependence on the magnetometer during times of detected interference. The results of this filter are combined with a Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) system to provide a robust indoor localization solution.",,,
414,Convergent global gene expression patterns recapitulate morphological convergence in squid symbiotic bioluminescence,"Convergent evolution is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the history of life. Classic examples of convergent traits, such as the camera-eyes in vertebrates and cephalopods or the wings of bats, birds and insects, convey the efficacy of natural selection as well as the common environmental constraints shared by organisms. Yet, the extent to which convergent molecular processes accompany structural convergence remains unclear. Convergent forms of bioluminescence have originated often across diverse forms of life, providing an excellent system for investigating the molecular signature of convergent evolution. Within cephalopods, an unusual form of bioluminescence dependent on luminous symbiotic bacteria has evolved multiple times. This project focuses on two distantly related species of squid, Euprymna scolopes and Uroteuthis edulis, which rely on such bioluminescent organs for a form of crypsis called counter-illumination. Although these species are separated by 300 million years of evolution, both organs invariably develop as distinctively bi-lobed structures called photophores, featuring prominent crystalline lenses and reflectors, and can recruit and culture luminous bacteria from surrounding waters. Here, I develop novel phylogenetic and quantitative approaches that reveal evidence that the evolution of a convergent phenotype is associated with the convergent expression of thousands of genes. To achieve this, I first infer the relationships among extant cephalopods using a multi-gene supermatrix approach for over 400 species. Using a series of independent phylogenetic analyses---including an implementation of a novel continuous-time Markov modeling approach---I then demonstrate that bacterial photophores have originated repeatedly during squid evolution. With this phylogenetic evidence strongly favoring convergence, I then assayed the expression of a suite of genes with documented roles in photophore physiology in a representative species from each of the two clades in which my analysis suggests independent origins. In Euprymna, we know that this complex organ not only regulates bacterial activity and modulates light output but also uses light-sensitive cells to detect light levels. Results of the quantitative expression assays largely concurred with the phylogenetic assessment: many key photophore genes are expressed at different levels between the two species. However, a different picture emerged upon comparison of global gene expression profiles underlying the two photophores. Using Illumina high-throughput sequencing I recovered full transcriptomes from the photophores as well as homologous traits from the two species. Three different measures of similarity indicate striking similarity between convergent photophores---as similar as expected in homologous traits. To account for possible co-linearity among genes (e.g., genetic modules), I also developed a regression technique to model tissue transcriptomes while minimizing the effect of co-varying gene expression values. These models suggest that not only homologous traits but also the convergent photophores have highly predictable gene expression patterns. Finally, I quantify and annotate genes specific to photophores in both species to determine which genes of similar function have been co-opted during the evolution of both photophores. Among the transcripts identified with high and/or localized expression in the photophore are several components of the innate immune system. This discovery contributes to the growing body of evidence that the innate immune system plays a crucial role in animal-microbe symbioses. The emerging picture suggests that, while the convergent evolution of bacterial photophores is characterized by a number of differences in gene expression---evident in candidate gene assays, the transcriptomic landscapes underlying these traits are largely congruent. Thus, squid bacterial photophores provide evidence that congruent expression patterns of thousands of genes can mirror the phenotypic evolution of a convergent trait.",,,
415,Regional Benthic Foraminiferal Oxygen Isotope Stacks for the Last Glacial Cycle,"The development of high quality age models for paleoclimate records is critical for constraining leads, lags, and rates of change within the climate system, which helps to elucidate the mechanisms of past climate changes. For example, improvements to age models for paleoclimate records from marine sediment cores were central to proving Milankovitch theory. In this dissertation, I compiled a quality-controlled database of almost 300 previously published benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope (delta 18O) records from globally distributed sites. The only way to directly date marine sediments is by radiocarbon dating, but this technique can only be used back to about 40,000 years ago and is subject to uncertainties about past surface reservoir age changes. Chapter 2 presents an averaged high-latitude North Atlantic reservoir age reconstruction based on aligning 33 deep North Atlantic benthic delta18O records and comparing high- and low-latitude planktonic foraminiferal radiocarbon dates. This reconstruction shows increased reservoir ages during the beginning of the last deglaciation and the Younger Dryas, which suggests that previous chronologies based on the assumption of constant reservoir age need to be revised by up to about 1,000 years. North Atlantic reservoir ages are also a proxy for Atlantic meridional overturning circulation strength, so deglacial reservoir age excursions provide insight into the timing and role of ocean circulation changes during the deglaciation. Regional benthic delta18O stacks and chronologies fill an important niche between global stacks and studies comparing a few well-dated records. Chapter 3 presents seven different regional benthic delta 18O stacks with independent planktonic 14C-based age models for 0-40,000 years ago. The stacks show regional differences in the timing of benthic delta18O change of up to 4,000 years during the last deglaciation. In Chapters 4 and 5, the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian benthic delta18O stacks are extended beyond the limits of radiocarbon to 145,000 years ago and combined into a single volume-weighted global stack. The regional stacks aligned to proxy data with well-constrained absolute age estimates provide improved chronostratigraphic constraints for the last glacial cycle. The volume-weighted global stack demonstrates errors of up to 4,000 years in the currently accepted global benthic delta 18O stack.",,,
417,Elasticity Primitives for Database as a Service,"Transactional databases are a critical component in data intensive applications. They enable application developers to persist and query data without having to design for concurrency control, fault tolerance, atomic multi-operation transactions, or physical storage layout. Due to their utility and general purpose design databases are widely used within organizations. However, databases are predicated on an architecture that assumes one database instance is dedicated to hosting a single application. Organizations managing many small databases with fluctuating requirements, face wasted resources and redundant costs. Building a database-as-a-service platform allows for the effective consolidation of many databases into a reduced number of servers. This dissertation focuses on the primitives, or tools, required to transform traditional database architectures into a distributed, scalable, and self-managed data platform. The presented primitives enable system elasticity, or the ability for a system to dynamically adapt the available capacity in response to changing resource requirements. First, we propose a self-managed controller to leverage expert administrators in managing database placement and maintaining system performance. This controller provides a method to identify resource requirements at runtime and a method to empirically learn how various databases will behave when colocated. These techniques are utilized to place databases and load-balance the system when resources are constrained. Second, this dissertation presents two techniques to migrate databases between servers without making the system unavailable for applications. These advances include the live migration of shared nothing databases and the live reconfiguration of partitioned main-memory databases. The presented primitives are critical steps in building a scalable database platform to host many applications using existing database architectures.",,,
418,Scalable and High Quality Algorithm Design For High Level Synthesis,"Current trends in SOC (System-on-Chip) design impose ever greater productivity demands on designers to meet the functional and technological complexity challenges while meeting decreasing time-to-market pressure. How to efficiently schedule and map operations, data movement and variable storage on a practically constrained hardware platform is a crucial part of high quality digital system design. Current high-level flows use a manual divide and conquer approach. In particular, system level instances are partitioned into tasks which are composed of operations. The multi-level approach is due in part to the failure of scalability of existing scheduling and mapping algorithms. This work describes a hierarchical framework that can dramatically increase the scalability of existing scheduling and mapping algorithms while maintaining the same or superior quality. The framework does not rely on existing application hierarchy. Instead, it automatically builds a hierarchical representation from a flat one, and uses the hierarchy to globally guide the scheduling and mapping process. The result is a practical scheme enabling a two order of magnitude increase in problem scale (>10k operations) while maintaining near-optimal results. Further, this is achieved with sub-quadratic algorithmic complexity in contrast to current cubic heuristic complexity. This dramatic scalability improvement blurs the boundary between abstraction levels and promotes detailed scheduling and mapping optimization to the task level.",,,
419,The Double Life of Miklos Rozsa's Viola Concerto: An Arrangement for Solo Viola and Chamber Ensemble,"For this document, I have created a third form of Rozsa's Viola Concerto by arranging it for a chamber ensemble consisting of two violins, violoncello, double bass, and piano. The viola part has remained identical to the composer's own two versions of the piece. Creating this third chamber version is a foray into a different kind of performance paradigm for the solo violist. Most violists will seldom have the opportunity to play this piece in its full orchestral setting, and will almost always learn the piece using the piano reduction score as a guide, as this reduction is the only scored form of the piece that is readily available for purchase. Performing the orchestral version of the concerto requires renting parts, purchasing a performance license, and of course a full orchestra on stage. Inversely, the piano reduction, though beautifully rich and masterfully conceived, creates a more intimate effect than a full orchestra would, and despite the success of the piece in this form, something of a sense of grandeur and monumental musical texture, found in the orchestral score, is lost when contained with two hands at a piano. Such limitations are sadly why the piece is perhaps not performed enough, remaining somewhat inaccessible to the everyday violist. The creation of a third chamber setting of the concerto serves to alleviate these limitations and difficulties by supplying the solo violist with an accompaniment that embraces an orchestral feel, without an orchestral mass. I have done this by careful study of both original versions of the piece, seeking to capture all voices, textures, and interplay between the musical lines of the full orchestra and soloist, which often are left out of the piano reduction.",,,
420,Landscape effects on crop pollination,"Animal-mediated crop pollination is an essential ecosystem service for the production of 75% of globally important crops. In intensive agricultural production systems, this service is usually provided by managed honeybees, but wild bees are natural providers of this service and can enhance crop pollination even in the presence of honeybees. For the first chapter, I sampled pollinators associated with blueberry fields in south-central Chile and explore how landscape context can affect densities of queen bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), which is the most abundant wild pollinator found in these systems. Queen bumblebees can be positively affected by forest area and negatively affected by a high-food resource area (flowering crops that are attractive to pollinators). Both effects were strongest at spatial scales of 2500-meter radius distance. In the second chapter, I study the movement behavior of queen bumblebees foraging in blueberry fields. Observation data were used to link bumblebee densities to the number of times each flower in the field is visited by a bumblebee. A higher number of flower visits translates into larger fruit set/weight, up to a threshold at which pollen saturation occurs. Movement patterns were highly directional along blueberry rows, and individuals tended to move toward the nearest plants. Using movement models, I show that observed movement patterns translate into a relatively efficient crop pollination service provision compared to movement patterns with random directionality. In the last chapter, I explore how crop heterogeneity at the landscape scale can increase the provision of crop pollination services. Crop heterogeneity was specified by classifying crops according to their timing of flowering. Higher crop heterogeneity translates into a more continuous food supply that promotes colony growth. It also decreases the transient ""dilution"" effect which is the reduction of pollinator density with increasing flowering crop area.",,,
421,Influences on legislative behavior: Party unity and legislative careers in Mexico,"Influences over individual and collective behavior, as expressed by voting unity patterns in the legislative arena, constitute the main substantive topic for this dissertation. In this project we examine the main determinants of party unity, with an emphasis on explaining when and why party unity breaks down in legislative voting, in settings where party unity is generally high. Researchers have long focused on explaining party unity by relying on institutional factors, such as the structure and characteristics of the electoral system. By combining these dominant institutional approaches of party unity with a micro level study of the individual incentives legislators face to preserve or break the party line, we test and contrast the specific predictions from the literature regarding party and individual legislative voting behavior. The Mexican political system between 1998 and 2011 is taken as the case study to test the theoretical propositions set in the literature, as it combines availability of electronic legislative voting records with a mixed member electoral system that does not allow for consecutive reelection.",,,
422,Kallikrein-7 as a template for the rational design of enhanced Abeta selectivity,"Proteases play a central role in a wide variety of crucial biological functions to sustain life including food digestion, immune response, and cell apoptosis. As a consequence of their contribution to the regulation of fundamental intra- and extracellular processes, abnormal regulation of protease activity has been associated with diverse human conditions. Despite their importance in these fundamental physiological processes relatively little is known or understood about the rules that govern proteases' individual specificities. In the work presented here, the substrate specificity of the serine protease kallikrein-7 (KLK7) is elucidated by bacterial peptide display. Sequential rounds of cell sorting for bacteria displaying substrates that exhibit favorable cleavage kinetics revealed a preferred substrate motif that was remarkably similar to the hydrophobic core of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide that is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. KLK7 was found to cleave specifically within the hydrophobic core of Abeta peptide that is largely responsible for its aggregation propensity, thereby slowing amyloid fibril formation and promoting the degradation of preformed fibrils. Further work demonstrated that Abeta oligomer preparations treated with KLK7 afforded a significant increase in neuronal survival compared to untreated preparations in an in vitro model. To better understand the substrate:protease interactions that determine the specificity of KLK7, site directed mutagenesis was applied. Active site residue N189 that was previously proposed to determine the specifity of the enzyme was randomized, resulting in five active KLK7 variants, one of which increased its selectivity from a tyrosine motif towards a phenylalanine motif that is present within the Abeta hydrophobic core. Furthermore, W215 of KLK7 was further implicated to be a primary determinant of its substrate specificity and subsequent turnover by participating in a putative cation-pi interaction with basic residues of peptidyl substrates. The results presented here establish for the first time that KLK7 has an intrinsic Abeta degrading capacity with novel specificity determinants that could possibly be exploited in future therapeutic applications.",,,
423,Cooperation and Trust in Response to Mediated Narratives: Can Synchronous Exposure to Moral Content Promote Prosocial Behavior?,"People tend to act more cooperatively immediately after engaging in synchronous activities together. The range of activities which fit this pattern is not yet theoretically well-understood, but mediated moral narratives may provide an interesting test case to aid in developing this understanding. To test whether synchronous experiences during simultaneous media use foster cooperation, an online experiment was conducted wherein participants engaged in either synchronous or asynchronous media use behavior, with varying narrative content (morally-charged vs. amoral narratives) to manipulate the media experience. Cooperation was measured using both self-reported feelings toward other group members and the outcome of a weak-link economic game. While the hypothesized effects did not reach statistical significance with the data from this experiment, effect directions were as expected. Subsequent exploratory analyses suggest theoretically interesting insights and useful directions for future research in this area.",,,
424,"Invasion, Impact and Persistence of an Exotic Annual Grass","The spread and rise to dominance of exotic species into the semi-arid grasslands of the western United States represents one of the most dramatic biological invasions to date. Currently, 90% of grasslands within California are dominated by exotic species, most notably exotic annual grasses from Europe. The research conducted here evaluates the effects of the widespread exotic annual grass, Bromus diandrus, and its thatch (i.e. dead persistent litter) on the physical and community structure in a central California grassland. The controls over Bromus diandrus persistence and spread in grasslands were also evaluated. Observational comparisons between native and exotic-dominated grassland patches were used to determine that exotic-dominated patches had more thatch and 3x less light at the soil surface than neighboring native patches. There were fewer species associated with exotic-dominated patches and species traits, such as timing of growth, seed size and plant height, were important in determining the distribution of species in the two patch types. Thatch and Bromus diandrus density were manipulated to evaluate the underlying mechanisms leading to native forb decline in grasslands invaded by Bromus diandrus. Thatch inhibited the performance of native forbs, while competition from living Bromus diandrus had little effect. There was also a positive Bromus diandrus-thatch feedback, whereby Bromus diandrus performed best with moderate amounts of thatch. The positive Bromus diandrus-thatch feedback may be one important factor contributing to the rise to dominance and persistence of this species in many grasslands. Given the negative effects of Bromus diandrus and its thatch on native species performance, I sought to understand the controls over its spread under predicted global change conditions. Bromus diandrus spread was facilitated by N enrichment and constrained by prolonged drought periods achieved through repatterned rainfall treatments. The invasion of the exotic annual grass, Bromus diandrus, into the grasslands of California has altered important plant resources, like light, and lead to the decline of many native forb species. Largely these biological impacts are mediated through the production of thatch, rather than living Bromus diandrus, indicating that management actions focusing on thatch removal will be the most promising for reducing the impact of this species.",,,
425,The Changing Status of Converted Jews in Thirteenth- and Fourteenth-Century Northern France,"This dissertation explores the relationship between religious and racial persecution by examining Christian responses to converted Jews in thirteenth- and fourteenth-century northern France. By reconstructing attitudes of Christian intellectuals towards the possibility of Jewish conversion and exploring the socio-economic status and integration of converts, the dissertation clarifies the degree to which Judaism was believed to be inextricably linked to identity in medieval France. The dissertation draws on financial and administrative records to reconstruct the career trajectory of Philippe le Convers, a high-level royal agent and the godson of King Philip the Fair (r. 1285--1314). Other prominent medieval converts, such as Henry of Winchester in England, eventually faced limits to their ability to integrate into Christian society, but Philippe's status as a convert does not appear to have limited his career---or his influence at court---in any way. The dissertation also draws on evidence from property records, guild records, and tax assessments to examine the socio-economic status of other French converts, showing that a significant number of converts were well integrated into multiple sectors of the Parisian working world in the late thirteenth century. Parisian converts lived and worked in Christian neighborhoods throughout the city, and a significant number of Parisian converts practiced lucrative, prestigious trades. Some Parisian converts formed associations with prominent bourgeois by gaining access to Christian guilds or by marrying into well-placed bourgeois families. The dissertation also draws on narrative sources, such as chronicles and ecclesiastical visitation registers, in order to explore Christian chroniclers' perceptions of converted Jews from the late twelfth through the late fourteenth century, arguing that Christian chroniclers in France began to express heightened concerns about the status and trustworthiness of French converts, as a group, only after the expulsions of Jews from France in the early fourteenth century. France was one of the earliest countries to implement a national expulsion of Jews, and French policies played a major role in establishing the tone of anti-Jewish legislation throughout medieval Europe. Other studies have shown that the persecution of Jews intensified in northern Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and scholars have assumed that negative attitudes towards Jews must have applied to converts, as well. However, this dissertation argues that until the expulsions of the early fourteenth century, French converts were well integrated into Christian society and that evidence from a broad range of sources demonstrates a growing concern about the status and trustworthiness of converts in France only after the waves of expulsions in the fourteenth century.",,,
426,"Discriminating Among Plant Species and Functional Types Using Spectroscopy Data: Evaluating Capabilities Within and Across Ecosystems, Across Spatial Scales and Through Seasons","Remote sensing data provide a quantitative, spatially extensive and repeatable method for mapping and measuring Earth's vegetation. In particular, imaging spectrometers, which measure reflectance in many narrow, contiguous wavelengths, are sensitive to subtle differences in plant structure, biochemistry, physiology and phenology. The need for improved global assessments of biodiversity, species and plant functional type (PFT) distributions, and ecosystem function has paved the way for the proposal of a spaceborne imaging spectrometer with monthly, global coverage. In this research, I evaluated such a sensor's capabilities for accurately mapping species and PFTs in contrasting ecosystems, at varying spatial resolutions and through the year. Using airborne imaging spectrometer data acquired over five different ecosystems, I compared strategies for mapping dominant plant species. Different combinations of training data selection, dimension reduction and classification methods yielded a range of accuracies, but overall, species could be accurately mapped both within single ecosystems and when ecosystem data were pooled. By spatially aggregating these images to simulate coarser resolution data, I assessed the accuracy of both species and PFT classification in these same five ecosystems. My results demonstrated that the best resolution for mapping varied by site and with PFT composition and diversity. Finally, I analyzed monthly field spectroscopy data in a Mediterranean ecosystem to quantify seasonal changes in spectral separability and to relate these with phenological observations. For each of three vegetation communities, separability was related to plant functional trait differences and changed in response to phenological differences. Differences in separability were also observed between coastal and inland sites within the same community types related to local meteorological and site conditions. Overall, the results of this work support the launch of a spaceborne imaging spectrometer with global, monthly coverage. They demonstrate the utility of the entire spectrum for differentiating among species and PFTs, as well as the added value of monthly data for improving our understanding of the relationship between seasonal spectral change and phenological changes observed on the ground.",,,
427,Religious legitimacy and the nation of islam: In re ferguson and muslim inmates' religious rights in the 1950s and 1960s,"On January 9, 1961, Folsom State Prison inmate Jesse L. Ferguson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the Supreme Court of the State of California. Ferguson, a member of the Nation of Islam, alleged that prison administrators had denied Muslim inmates the right to freely practice their religion, violating their constitutionally guaranteed rights. In his defense, however, Director of Corrections, Robert A. McGee, argued that the Muslim inmates' ""quasi-religion"" posed a significant threat to the health, safety, and welfare of correctional facilities, inmates, and staff. In this thesis I examine the case documents, analyzing the context and content of In re Ferguson with the aim of explicating the arguments made before the court and situating them in a broader historical narrative. The Ferguson case reflects many of the religious and judicial debates of the 1950s and 1960s. These debates had a significant impact on the Nation of Islam's legal status in prisons and the extent to which constitutional protections of incarcerated members' religious rights applied. What I present is an analysis of relevant historical material through which we can trace contestations over the Nation of Islam's religious nature and its recognition as a religious organization in prisons.",,,
428,Aqueous synthesis of zinc oxide films for GaN optoelectronic devices,"GaN-based LEDs have generally made use of ITO transparent contacts as current-spreading layers for uniform current injection. However, the high raw material and processing costs of ITO layers have generated interest in potentially cheaper alternatives. In this work, zinc oxide transparent layers were fabricated by a low-cost, low-temperature aqueous epitaxial growth method at 90C for use as transparent contacts to GaN LEDs on c-plane sapphire, and on semipolar bulk GaN substrates. Low-voltage operation was achieved for c-plane devices, with voltages below 3.8V for 1mm2 broad-area LEDs at a current density of 30A/cm 2. Blue-green LEDs on 2021-plane GaN also showed low voltage operation below 3.5V at 30A/cm2. Ohmic contact resistivity of 1:8 x 10-2Ocm2 was measured for films on (2021) p-GaN templates. Ga-doped films had electrical conductivities as high as 660S/cm after annealing at 300C. Optical characterization revealed optical absorption coefficients in the 50--200cm -1 range for visible light, allowing thick films with sheet resistances below 10O/&square; to be grown while minimizing absorption of the emitted light. Accurate and reproducible etch-free patterning of the ZnO films was achieved using templated growths with SiOx hard masks. A roughening method is described which was found to increase peak LED efficiencies by 13% on c-plane patterned sapphire (PSS) substrates. In addition, ZnO films were successfully employed as laser-cladding layers for blue (2021) lasers, with a threshold current density of 8.8kA/cm 2.",,,
430,Spectral Properties of the Koopman Operator in the Analysis of Nonstationary Dynamical Systems,"In the first direction, we develop the Generalized Laplace Analysis (GLA) for both spectral operators of scalar type (in the sense of Dunford) and non spectral operators. The GLA is a method of constructing eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator corresponding to non-unimodular eigenvalues. It represents an extension of the ergodic theorems proven for ergodic, measure-preserving, on-attractor dynamics to the case where we have off-attractor dynamics. We also give a general procedure for constructing an appropriate Banach space of functions on which the Koopman operator is spectral. We explicitly construct these spaces for attracting fixed points and limit cycles. The spaces that we introduce and construct are generalizations of the familiar Hilbert Hardy spaces in the complex unit disc. Part II of the dissertation represents a divergence from the first part in that it does not deal with the Koopman operator explicitly. In the second part, we consider the problem of using exponentially mixing dynamical systems to generate trajectories for an agent to follow in its search for a physical target in a large domain. The domain is a compact subset of the n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn. It is assumed that the size of the target is unknown and can take any value in some continuous range. Furthermore, it is assumed that the target can be located anywhere in the domain with equal probability. In the second direction, we develop the theory of switched semigroups of Koopman operators. Each semigroup is assumed to be spectral of scalar-type with unimodular point spectrum, but possibly non-unimodular continuous spectrum. The functions evolve by applying one semigroup for a period of time, then switching to another semigroup. We develop an approximation of the vector-valued function evolution by a linear approximation in the vector space that the functions map into. A basis for this linear approximation is constructed from the vector-valued modes that are coefficients of the projections of the vector-valued observable onto scalar-valued eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator. The unmodeled modes show up as noisy dynamics in the output space. We apply this methodology to traffic matrices of an Internet Service Provider's (ISP's) network backbone. Traffic matrices measure the traffic volume moving between an ingress and egress router for the network's backbone. It is shown that on each contiguous interval of time in which a single semigroup acts the modal dynamics are deterministic and periodic with Gaussian or nearly-Gaussian noise superimposed. We cast this problem as one in the field of quantitative recurrence theory, a relatively new sub-branch of ergodic theory. We give constructive proofs for upper bounds of hitting times of small metric balls in Rn for mixing transformations of various speeds. The upper bounds and limit laws we derive say, approximately, that the hitting time is bounded above by some constant multiple of the inverse of the measure of the metric ball. From these results, we derive upper bounds for the expected hitting time, with respect to the range of target sizes [delta, V), to be of order O(--ln delta). First order, continuous time dynamics are constructed from discrete time mixing transformations and upper bounds for these hitting times are shown to be proportional to the discrete time case. Another viewpoint that is becoming more prevalent is the operator-theoretic / functional-analytic one which describes the system in terms of the evolution of functions or measures defined on the state space. Part I of this doctoral dissertation focuses on the Koopman, or composition, operator that determines how a function on the state space evolves as the state trajectories evolve. Most current studies involving the Koopman operator have dealt with its spectral properties that are induced by dynamical systems that are, in some sense, stationary (in the probabilistic sense). The dynamical systems studied are either measure-preserving or initial conditions for trajectories are restricted to an attractor for the system. In these situations, only the point spectrum on the unit circle is considered; this part of the spectrum is called the unimodular spectrum. This work investigates relaxations of these situations in two different directions. The first is an extension of the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator to dynamical systems possessing either dissipation or expansion in regions of their state space. The second is to consider switched, stochastically-driven dynamical systems and the associated collection of semigroups of Koopman operators. The dominating methodology used in the study of dynamical systems is the geometric picture introduced by Poincare. The focus is on the structure of the state space and the asymptotic behavior of trajectories. Special solutions such as fixed points and limit cycles, along with their stable and unstable manifolds, are of interest due to their ability to organize the trajectories in the surrounding state space.",,,
431,"Design, Synthesis and Theoretical Investigation of Small Molecules for Utility in Organic Semiconducting Devices","Four isostructural molecules, including p-DTS(FBTTh 2)2 were investigated with single crystal x-ray diffraction. While all four molecules appear topologically equivalent, two types of crystal structure were observed with distinct crystal systems and each with a characteristic molecular geometry. A multi-scale theoretical investigation of simulated isolated molecules and experimentally determined crystal structures offers a clear explanation for the observed lattices, where useful experimental data is unavailable. In order to elucidate the relationship between structure and properties, a class of small molecules was developed adhering to what can be described as a D'ADAD' architecture, where D, D' and A refer to an electron rich core, electron rich end-caps and electron deficient heterocyclic fragments, respectively. These fragments, as well as solubilizing side groups were systematically modified, yielding useful design rules for organic donor materials as well as record breaking small-molecule OPV devices. The top performing material in the group exhibited diminutive performance on the ubiquitous solution deposited substrate PEDOT:PSS due to interfacial chemistry. This led to the development of a new material, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, which was not susceptible to the interfacial chemistry with PEDOT:PSS, and broke the previous performance record for solution-processed small molecule OPV devices. Solution-processed small molecule bulk-heterojunction solar cells represent a specific subset of organic photovoltaics (OPV). OPV devices rely on materials with appropriately aligned frontier molecular orbitals, bandgaps commensurate with the solar spectrum, and ultimately must self-assemble into a morphology conducive to high device performance. Optical electronic and physical properties in organic materials are highly sensitive to their chemical structure and the conformations of those structures in space. Materials can be engineered to exhibit specific traits; a process referred to as ""molecular design."" While the molecular design toolbox is ever-expanding, each of these properties requires unique considerations, and indeed vary greatly in the degree of control the synthetic chemist has in producing predictable properties.",,,
432,Serialization and Hierarchy: From Data to Corpus in Linguistic Fieldwork,"The structure of digital documentation should empower linguists to search the entirety of a documentary archive. This should be possible even when multiple tools were used to enter the data into the archive. Current practice tends to lead toward fragmenting of archives along the lines of the tools themselves: data entered in one tool cannot generally be searched outside of that tool, and thus data produced by distinct tools cannot be combined and aggregated. The solution to this problem requires an approach which is more general than critique of existing software. In this thesis I elaborate a general but simple way to digitize linguistic data which enables annotation of arbitrary levels of linguistic or annotative detail. A key benefit of this approach is that it allows for documentation which can be searched across levels of language structure, and across varied sorts of linguistic annotation. It is hoped that this simpler, more general design for archival documentation will contribute to the production of linguistic documentation, upon which in principle many sorts of software could operate, and which would be of use to linguists with many and varied interests.",,,
433,Stepping Up the Cybersecurity Game: Protecting Online Services from Malicious Activity,"As a consequence, online services receive activity from both legitimate and malicious users. However, while legitimate users use these services for the purposes they were designed for, malicious parties exploit them for their illegal actions, which are often linked to an economic gain. In this thesis, I show that the way in which malicious users and legitimate ones interact with Internet services presents differences. I then develop mitigation techniques that leverage such differences to detect and block malicious parties that misuse Internet services. As a last example, I present EvilCohort, a system that detects communities of online accounts that are accessed by the same botnet. EvilCohort works by clustering together accounts that are accessed by a common set of IP addresses, and can work on any online service that requires the use of accounts (social networks, web-based emails, blogs, etc.). I then study the problem of misused accounts on online social networks. I first look at the problem of fake accounts that are set up by cybercriminals to spread malicious content. I study the modus operandi of the cybercriminals controlling such accounts, and I then develop a system to automatically flag a social network accounts as fake. I then look at the problem of legitimate accounts getting compromised by miscreants, and I present COMPA, a system that learns the typical habits of social network users and considers messages that deviate from the learned behavior as possible compromises. The rise in popularity of online services such as social networks, web-based emails, and blogs has made them a popular platform for attackers. Cybercriminals leverage such services to spread spam, malware, and steal personal information from their victims. In a typical cybercriminal operation, miscreants first infect their victims' machines with malicious software and have them join a botnet, which is a network of compromised computers. In the second step, the infected machines are often leveraged to connect to legitimate online services and perform malicious activities. As examples of this research approach, I first study the problem of spamming botnets, which are misused to send hundreds of millions of spam emails to mailservers spread across the globe. I show that botmasters typically split a list of victim email addresses among their bots, and that it is possible to identify bots belonging to the same botnet by enumerating the mailservers that are contacted by IP addresses over time. I developed a system, called BotMagnifier, which learns the set of mailservers contacted by the bots belonging to a certain botnet, and finds more bots belonging to that same botnet.",,,
434,Sometimes I'm Lesbian: Young Women's High School Coming Out Experiences in the Post-Gay Era,"This study explores young women's experiences ""coming out"" in high school. I find that across race and class backgrounds, young women in high school are increasingly coming to articulate their sexuality as fluid rather than with more conventional stable identity categories such as ""lesbian."" Based on 79 ethnographic interviews with women who came to see themselves as non-heterosexual in high school, I find 46 (58%) identify themselves as fluid/pansexual/queer or without a label, 7 (9%) identify as bisexual, 15 (19%) identify as lesbian but also somewhat fluid, and 11 (14%) identify as strictly lesbian. I find the use of ""fluid"" (and related synonyms) as a label is more than a shift in language; women who come to see themselves as fluid have markedly different experiences coming out in high school than do women who identify as lesbian. Young women in high school who identify as fluid and those who identify as lesbian have a similar process in coming to recognize their romantic and sexual attractions, and yet those who identify as lesbian are far more likely to feel stigmatized from their peers because of their sexual orientation.",,,
435,Development of Artificial Pancreas Using Enhanced Control Algorithm and Insulin Delivery,"Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is a metabolic disorder in which an individual experiences chronic hyperglycemia (high level of blood glucose), because the pancreatic beta--cells cannot produce or secrete sufficient insulin. Without proper exogenous insulin injection treatment, people with T1DM may experience the complications (vascular damage, kidney failure, or eye damage) related to chronic hyperglycemia, and the complications may eventually result in death. However, the insulin injection treatment also can be harmful, as an over-dose of insulin may result in hypoglycemia (low level of blood glucose) that may result in confusion, coma, or death. The theoretical analysis and simulation results regarding the impact of insulin PK/PD on an AP illustrated that the faster acting insulin would result in a faster meal disturbance rejection and tighter glucose regulation. The simulation and clinical evaluations of the semi-automated AP (the AP consists of subcutaneous closed-loop control and inhalation of rapid acting Technosphere RTM Insulin, TI, at meal time) demonstrated that the inhalation of TI at meal time provided the necessary first phase insulin that was not achievable by conventional subcutaneous insulin delivery alone. The semi-automated AP using TI provided faster meal disturbance rejection without imposing extra hypoglycemia risk. The AP using rapid absorbing intraperitoneal insulin also resulted in better glucose regulation (longer time in the clinically accepted safe region, 70-180 mg/dL, and lower postprandial blood glucose peak) compared to the conventional AP using subcutaneous insulin. In addition, the {it in silico} evaluations showed that the MHSE estimated the states more accurately than the Luenberger observer. The zone-MPC using the MHSE responded to the meal earlier and more aggressively compared to the zone-MPC using the Luenberger observer. An Artificial Pancreas (AP) is an automated closed-loop system that measures blood glucose concentration and delivers insulin to regulate blood glucose for people with T1DM. Even though there has been significant technological advancement in the AP development, slow absorbing subcutaneous insulin delivery has limited the AP{textquotesingle}s ability to deal with unannounced meal disturbances. As an effort to reduce the actuation delay of the system, rapid acting inhaled and intraperitoneal insulin delivery options have attracted attention as alternative insulin delivery methods for the AP development. In the work presented in this dissertation, the impact of insulin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) on performance and robustness of the closed-loop AP was investigated, and two novel APs using enhanced alternative insulin delivery options (inhaled and intraperitoneal routes) were designed and evaluated in simulation and in clinic. Also, a Moving Horizon State Estimator (MHSE) was incorporated into the zone Model Predictive Control (zone-MPC) algorithm to enhance the meal disturbance rejection capacity of the control algorithm.",,,
436,Regional Streamflow Response to Wildfire in California Watersheds,"Baseflow recession rates are an important tool for predicting low flows, yet little is known about how baseflow recession rates respond to wildfire at either watershed or regional scales. A mixed model was introduced to regionalize post-fire streamflow change. Mixed modeling is a statistical approach used to synthesize data containing a hierarchical structure, such as streamflow data pooled from multiple watersheds experiments. A parsimonious storage-discharge model was used to provide insight into the hydrologic processes controlling baseflow recession rates. Annual streamflow significantly increased following wildfire in California at a regional scale. This response was greatest in watersheds with higher percentages of watershed area burnt and during moderately wet years. The first-order control on baseflow recession rates in California was found to be inter-seasonal changes in antecedent storage, not wildfire. As every watershed and every wildfire event is unique, streamflow response to wildfire is only representative of the specific watershed and conditions that produced the response. Most post-fire streamflow change experiments involve single watersheds, which limits extrapolation of the results beyond the particular watershed examined. A comprehensive understanding of post-fire streamflow response is needed at a regional scale to improve water resources planning and ecosystem management in California. For this dissertation, the regional effect of wildfire was examined for two different components of the streamflow hydrograph; annual streamflow yield and baseflow recession rates. Annual streamflow is a key variable for streamflow management, but high variability in post-fire annual streamflow response at the watershed scale has limited predictions of post-fire annual streamflow response at the regional scale. Baseflow recession rates were observed to decrease by up to an order of magnitude as antecedent storage levels increased, indicating a shift in the source of recession flows from small, quickly-recharged aquifers at the beginning of the wet season to large, seasonal aquifers as the wet season progressed. Following wildfire, baseflow recession rates significantly decreased at a regional scale, suggesting that the dominant hydrologic processes affected by fire were related to post-fire reductions in above-ground vegetation (e.g. decreased interception, decreased soil evapotranspiration, decreased groundwater evapotranspiration).",,,
437,Primitive Model Simulations and Mean-Field Studies of Electric Double Layers,"When a charged surface, such as an electrode, colloid, or protein, is submerged into an electrolyte or ionic liquid, ions within the fluid rearrange into electric double layers (EDLs) that electrostatically screen the interfacial charge. The electrostatic potential and ion distributions within EDLs have long been described by mean-field local-density approximations (LDAs) that assume flat electrodes, uncorrelated ions, and bulk forms for the chemical potential. The objective of this work is to elucidate LDA failure mechanisms and supplement or supplant mean-field treatments of electrochemical systems that fail to capture correlated behavior. We develop an exceedingly general method, which requires no a priori model and identifies whether EDLs in a given electrolyte can obey a LDA, or whether more advanced approaches (e.g. integro-differential equations, atomistic simulations, etc.) are required, irrespective of the source of LDA breakdown. We combine continuum-level theoretical studies with complementary simulations in order to critically assess the accuracy of LDA models of implicit solvent electrolytes with equal and differently sized ions. We also pose a novel LDA model that seeks to address solvation, polarizability, and finite-size interactions present in actual and simulated EDLs with explicit solvent.",,,
438,Homogeneous Gold Catalysis: Ligand Design and Reactions of Alkynes,"In the past dozen years, great progress has been made in developing highly efficient homogenous gold catalysis. As soft ""pi"" Lewis acids, cationic gold(I) complexes are particularly powerful in terms of activating alkyne/allene towards nucleophilic attack, leading to a variety of synthetically versatile structures. During my research, several synthetic methods have been developed, including: (1) Au-catalyzed ligand-directed anti nucleophilic attack of alkynes; the new ligands I developed enable highly efficient gold-catalyzed nucleophilic addition of acids, anilines and water to the alkynes; and catalyst loadings could be lowered to 10 parts per million; (2) rapid access of chroman-3-ones via gold-catalyzed oxidation of propargyl aryl ethers; this step-economic and efficient transformation was realized by a bulky gold catalyst, Me4tBuXPhosAuNTf2 and bulky electron-deficient pyridine N-oxides derived from Hantzsch esters; (3) Au-catalyzed novel indole synthesis via a key [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement; 2-alkylindoles were produced with high regioselectivity and efficiency from easily accessed N-arylhydroxylamines under mild conditions; an improved approach involved cooperative dual catalysis of Zn and Au was developed; much broader substrate scope, shorter reaction time and good to excellent yields were achieved.",,,
439,Embedding Threshold Concepts in a Large Lecture Course: An Examination of Uptake of Disciplinary Actions,"This study looked at how threshold concepts were introduced in a large lecture history course. The analytical framework for viewing the results provided a lens to look at how the concepts were introduced and carried throughout the course. This framework, shaped by the situated learning and threshold concepts literature, looked at the ""careers"" of the concepts and how they were woven through a large learning system from professor to TAs to students. Research in teaching and learning in higher education in the last fifteen years addresses the importance of integrating disciplinary ways of thinking -- i.e. an understanding of the ways that questions are asked and investigated within disciplines -- in undergraduate courses. However, the application of this emergent research varies in history departments and in large lecture survey courses. This study addresses the gap in research about effective modes for introducing disciplinary thinking in a large lecture history course through the means of the threshold concepts framework. This dissertation contributes to three areas of research in higher education: application of threshold concepts at the course level; what this application looks like in terms of practices at the discussion section level; and the role of the teaching assistant in his or her own development in teaching history and within the discipline. In order for the careers of the concepts to carry through the course, certain teaching capabilities need to be in place to ensure the concepts reach students. The methods used to determine the uptake of concepts in the TA discussion sections were classroom observations, online surveys and interviews. Results show that teaching assistants are a crucial link for the careers of the concepts within a large lecture course. Moreover, teaching assistants' orientation to threshold concepts contribute to an explicit emphasis on the disciplinary concepts within their own work as disciplinarians and researchers. Tracing the careers of these concepts yielded more information about what is needed within the large course system in terms of the types of processes that need to be in place to support the inclusion of the concepts in the course. Threshold concepts afford faculty an opportunity to rethink the goals and principles that drive their course. Translation and framing of these concepts represented the threshold capabilities needed on the part of the teachers (both the professor and TAs) to support the movement of concepts from professor to students. The historical thinking strategies, such as analyzing primary sources, represented the particular threshold actions needed to support students in moving through thresholds to the discipline. While this is a baseline qualitative study of one large lecture course at UCSB, implications of this work contribute to graduate student teaching development and threshold concept course design.",,,
440,Light Scattering Behavior for Anisotropic Colloidal Particles,"The interaction of light with matter is one of the most fundamental processes in the physical sciences. In particular, the interaction of visible light with submicron particles is of great interest to a variety of scientific disciplines. Over the years, extensive theoretical models have been developed to calculate the light scattering properties for a variety of particle shapes and sizes. While extensive progress has been realized on the theoretical front, experimental analysis for nonspherical particles has been lacking. This is largely due to difficulty synthesizing nonspherical colloidal particles with high monodispersity. By taking advantage of a film stretching technique, we were able to synthesize large quantities of monodisperse polystyrene rod shaped particles with aspect ratios ranging from 1 to 9. The first study in this dissertation explores the incremental effects of changing particle shape on the total scattering cross-section and multi-angle intensity distribution. The second study investigates the relationship between particle shape and specular reflection properties for multilayered colloidal films comprised of identically shaped particles.",,,
441,"Fear of Miscegenation in the Antebellum Riots of New York 1834, Boston 1835, and Philadelphia 1838","My work begins with a brief history of the formation of the discourse of amalgamation/miscegenation and the historiography on the subject. It follows with a detailed narrative of the three riots in the cities mentioned. Then it offers an analysis of the unique role that abolitionist women played in these three riots, by unintentionally inciting the mob as they stepped out of their customary, socially sanctioned roles. A detailed analysis of the vital role of the anti-abolitionist media in inciting to violence and the abolitionists' response to it follows. The dissertation concludes with an analysis of the reasons for the decline of anti-abolitionist violence. It also offers a succinct look into the relationship between fear of miscegenation and lynching, asserting that the southern lynching mobs were driven by the same fear that fueled the mobs in the three northern cities examined. A frequently occurring disturbance among northern urban centers in antebellum America was racially-motivated mob violence against abolitionists and African Americans. My dissertation undertakes comparative analysis of incidents of anti-abolitionist and anti-Black mob violence in three major Northeastern cities: New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. I propose that the major cause for these incidents was fear of the social/romantic and/or sexual mixing of African Americans and Whites. To research this question, I examined data collected from primary sources stored in or held by the Rare Books and Manuscripts of the Library of Congress, the Boston Public Library, the New York Historical Society, the Antiquarian Society, the Library Company of Philadelphia, and Syracuse University, and included digitized newspapers of the period. Published primary sources were also consulted, as well as secondary sources on or related to the subject. I was impressed by the relationship I found between some of the antebellum violence against abolitionists and their supporters, and the repeated expressed fear and hatred of amalgamation (whether real or perceived as real). Even though others had mentioned the possibility of this relationship, no one had explored it in depth. At the end of the research phase of this work I saw how fear and hatred of amalgamation/miscegenation arose again in the late 19th century and the first five decades of the 20th century, thus attesting to the power of an ideology to foster violence.",,,
442,Vital Communication: Conflict Correspondents in Network Culture,"My dissertation examines these compelling figures, analyzing the ambivalent labor and the tricky logistics of war correspondence in the context of globalization, digitization, newsroom downsizing, and the war on terror. Drawing upon qualitative interviews, discourse analysis, archival research, and site studies, my research reveals that in order to survive, physically and professionally, war reporters must increasingly play a variety of roles: they must replace whole news bureaus that have been closed, they must blur the boundaries between above- and below-the-line labor, they must successfully wield digital technologies in competition with amateur bloggers whom they also exploit, and they must serve as a site of cultural value for the news networks even after they have been kidnapped, injured, raped, or killed. The present moment is defined by the visibility of war, exploding at sites that are increasingly monitored by both military and commercial entities. At a time when the Pentagon has restricted the agency of news organizations in warzones, and when amateur and quasi-professional bloggers in various geopolitical regions are destabilizing the primacy of mainstream news networks, scholars from both the humanities and the social sciences are closely evaluating the interconnections between war and media. Though media scholars such as Barbie Zelizer, Daya Thussu, and Toby Miller have crucially discussed the international television and online news coverage of the US-led War on Terror, I look closely at the nuanced cultural meaning of the conflict correspondents themselves, the increasingly beleaguered news employees who occupy the paradoxical position of both framer and framed, digital media producer and commodified cultural sign.",,,
443,The Self-efficacy of Businesswomen: Understanding Generational Cohorts of Saudi Arabian Advocates,"The purpose of this study is to explore the self-efficacy of Saudi businesswomen and advocates at the Saudi Arabian regional Chambers of Commerce and Industry and to contribute to our understanding of how Saudi Arabian women leaders develop over time. Through Bandura's self-efficacy framework (2005) and its effect on two key generational cohorts of women advocates, much can be learned about those women leaders advocating for the rights of Saudi businesswomen. My focus on self-efficacy of these two Generational Cohorts came from a pilot study (Alfrayan, 2013) on the self-efficacy component of leadership among Saudi businesswomen in three main regions in Saudi Arabia, Riyadh, Jeddah, and the Eastern province. The pilot study yielded evidence of the existence of two distinct Generational Cohorts among the Participants. The two Generational Cohorts are characterized by the event of the establishment of a women section that provided services to businesswomen. It is important to note that different geographic regions established women sections at their local chamber of commerce on different dates. Thus, the generations are not defined by time, but by context. Focus is given to how these leaders describe the development of their self-efficacy and what they chose to do with it. For the purpose of this study, the Generational Cohorts of the Participants were added as a dimension to understand how self-efficacy compares between generations. Using a Quantitative case study approach to closely studying six cases of two generational cohorts in three geographical locations was preformed. Applying Bandura's (1995) self-efficacy framework as the lens for examining the leadership development of businesswomen and professionals in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in two generations by researching the following questions were answered: What do Saudi Arabian businesswomen and advocates identify as the most important factors furthering and hindering the development of their self-efficacy to advocate for a larger role for women in business? and In what ways do these women leaders describe the two Generational Cohorts of women advocate's effects on one another?",,,
444,Essays in Environmental and Natural Resource Economics and Econometrics,"The third chapter deals with the identification and estimation of treatment effects under interference. The framework of potential outcomes has historically assumed that the treatment status of other individual's does not influence a given individual's outcome. However, many empirical settings are characterized by ""interference"", where an individual's outcome depends both on own treatment and the treatments of others. We extend the potential outcomes framework and define treatment effects that are relevant in such settings. Treatment effects may involve a comparison between outcomes when an individual's treatment status changes or when only the treatment statuses of others change. We propose necessary conditions under which a full range of treatment effects are identified and show how these effects can be estimated through a linear regression. Evidence from simulations suggests that incorrect specification of the regression equation can result is highly misleading estimates. In the second chapter, I investigate the ""resource curse"" hypothesis in the context of a single country (the United States), focusing in particular on the role of institutional differences across states in mitigating or amplifying the resource curse. I build on the work of Papyrakis and Gerlagh (2007) by explicitly considering the interaction between a state's natural resource wealth and its institutional quality as measured by per capita corruption convictions. I find that natural resource wealth is associated with lower economic growth only in relatively corrupt states. In states with relatively little corruption, natural resource wealth is actually associated with higher economic growth. These results suggest that the institutional aspect of the resource curse hypothesis is relevant even in a developed country context. The first chapter deals with rent-seeking behavior with respect to environmental regulation. The allocation of costless permits during the establishment of an emission permit trading program creates incentives for rent-seeking. I hypothesize that firms with strong political connections have an advantage in rent-seeking, which I model as a low rent-seeking cost in a contest for permits. Low rent-seeking costs are predicted to yield a higher permit allocation for a firm in equilibrium. This prediction is tested by exploiting an unusual feature of the U.K.'s allocation procedure in Phase 1 of the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme for carbon dioxide emissions. I observe both a firm's actual permit allocation as well as an earlier, provisional allocation that was rooted in technocratic projections of future emissions but was never implemented. Firms had the opportunity to appeal their provisional allocation. I find that a firm's financial connections to members of the House of Commons strongly predict its post-appeal allocation. Even after controlling for the provisional allocation, along with industry and financial characteristics, a connection to an additional member is associated with a significant increase in a firm's actual permit allocation. Although no data exist on the amount firms spent on rent-seeking, theoretical predictions on rent-dissipation provide a basis for estimating these expenditures. The welfare loss from rent- seeking is estimated to be at least 137 million euros, which represents a significant cost over and above the abatement costs firms incurred to reduce their emissions. This dissertation is a collection of essays that contributes to the fields of environmental and natural resource economics and econometrics. The role of political economy factors in environmental and natural resource economics is a common theme of the first two chapters. The third chapter is a contribution to econometric methodology.",,,
445,Improving Non-Volatile Memory Lifetime through Temporal Wear-Limiting,"Non-volatile memory technologies provide a low-power, high-density alternative to traditional DRAM main memories, yet all suffer from some degree of limited write endurance. The non-uniformity of write traffic exacerbates this limited endurance, causing write-induced wear to concentrate on a few specific lines. Wear-leveling attempts to mitigate this issue by distributing write-induced wear uniformly across the memory. Orthogonally, wear-limiting attempts to increase memory lifetime by directly reducing wear. In this paper, we present the concept of temporal wear-limiting, in which we exploit the trade-off between write latency and memory lifetime. Using a history of the slack between per-bank write operations, we predict future write latency, allowing for up to a 1.5x memory lifetime improvement. We present two extensions for improving the effectiveness of this history-based mechanism: a method for dynamically determining the optimum history size, and a method for increasing lifetime improvement through address prediction.",,,
446,"Terahertz Systems Engineering: Detectors, Sources, Propagation, Phenomenology, Design and Analysis","These projects inherently involved multidisciplinary research though they all were targeted towards the THz regime. The research in this dissertation exemplifies the broad knowledge and diverse fields that must be synergized to build effective THz systems and advance science in the THz domain. Specifically, in the field of THz phenomenology, I conducted a study to show the primary contrast mechanism in reflective biomedical imaging is water concentration. For source technology, I detail the development and characterization of photoconductive switches with record-breaking optical efficiency. In a separate study I developed a model which explains the complex photocarrier dynamics in fast-trapping THz photoconductive materials and show that high-frequency THz generation (>1 THz) is caused by beaching saturation. The terahertz (THz) band, from 300 GHz to 20 THz, is the last remaining frontier of the electromagnetic spectrum. Fundamentally, the frequency is too high to use current electronic technologies, yet the photon energy is too low for optical systems. However, there is a rich set of phenomenology, science, and applications, which are only available with THz radiation. In order to exploit this, the THz engineer who is designing systems must be adept at integrating components with very limited performance into a system. This requires understanding and knowledge of a wide range of fields, including microwaves, infrared optics, material science, software development, atmospheric science, and the overall analysis and design of a system. My work in detectors shows the design of a quasi-optical radar that exploits low 1/f noise Schottky diodes for detection of slow moving objects, useful for biomedical sensing of respiration and heartbeat. In the field of THz propagation, I have located low atmospheric water vapor sites and characterized THz attenuation on a global scale with satellite remote sensing data. Finally, I show the analysis of a full system by showing 300-gigabit level THz ground to geostationary satellite links to moderately dry global locations. All of these works were published or submitted for publication. Any THz system involves the sensing of some phenomena, which can be under the direct control of the engineer, such as in a communication system, or set by the laws of physics, such as in an astronomical telescope, or some variant in between. Thus, the design of such a system is fundamentally related to sensing science. Here, we have to consider detector and source technology, the propagation of radiation, target phenomenology, and the overall design and analysis of the system. This dissertation presents research in all of these areas.",,,
447,Couple Identity Gaps and the Management of Stress and Conflict in Romantic Relationships,"With assumptions that perceptions of couple identity are beneficial to stress management and that perceptions of couple identity gaps are detrimental to stress management, it was hypothesized that these variables would predict romantic partners' a) perceptions of anxiety, stress, and negativity associated with a conflict-inducing discussion and b) their salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) and salivary cortisol reactivity and recovery in response to a conflict-inducing discussion. One hundred eighteen couples participated in a laboratory study, in which they engaged in a discussion about conflict-inducing topic and provided saliva samples to assess biological stress markers. The couples were also randomly assigned to one of three conditions (couple identity prime, individual identity prime, or control) to test whether priming partners' sense of couple identity (compared to individual identity) prior to the conflict-inducing discussion influenced the results. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of couple identity (or the degree to which one's partner and relationship are central to one's personal identity; Acitelli, Rogers, & Knee, 1999) in romantic partners' communicative and physiological management of stress associated with relational conflict. The current study extends the research on couple identity by introducing the concept of identity gaps (Hecht, 1993) into relational contexts as a way to explain why couples vary in their ability to manage stress. The results showed that perceptions of couple identity predicted perceptions of conflict negativity, but not anxiety or stress. Overall, perceptions of couple identity gaps emerged as a stronger predictor in this study than perceptions of couple identity. Perceptions of couple identity gaps were associated with greater conflict anxiety, stress, and negativity, as well as heightened cortisol and sAA reactivity. Intriguing results emerged when testing the possibility of interaction effects between the type of prime (couple identity or individual identity) and individuals' pre-existing perceptions of couple identity (and couple identity gaps) on conflict and stress outcomes. The interaction effect patterns suggest that for some outcomes, priming couple identity for those who have weak perceptions of couple identity or have high couple identity gap perceptions increases stress associated with conflict (self-reported and physiological). On the other hand, the interaction effects revealed some evidence that priming individual identity for those who have strong perceptions of couple identity or those with low couple identity gap perceptions increases stress associated with conflict (self-reported and physiological). The current study contributes to the existing research on couple identity by highlighting its role in the romantic partners' experiences and management of stress associated with relational conflict. The study also is the first known to the author to translate identity gaps from the individual context to a dyadic context. Furthermore, the predictive power of couple identity gaps in this study was noteworthy and further supports the viability of this concept in future relationship research. Finally, the study integrated multiple approaches to studying stress (cognitive, behavioral, and physiological) in a novel and theoretically-rich way.",,,
448,Output Regulation for Linear Hybrid Systems with Periodic Jump Times,"We begin by defining output regulation for this framework and developing a set of hybrid regulation equations and a hybrid internal model property. Following this we provide guidelines for the design of the regulator. The regulator should include an internal model capable of reproducing the output of the exosystem, as well as a stabilizer unit that is designed to make the closed loop system stable. The stabilizer unit used in this dissertation is a high gain stabilizer that utilizes a high gain observer to track unmeasured plant variables. The high gain methods are based on their continuous time counterparts. The internal model is designed with an eye towards general applicability and thus takes advantage of a property called ""visibility,"" so as to reproduce the steady-state trajectory of the exosystem, as opposed to the entire state, which is all that turns out to be necessary in order to achieve output regulation. The goal of this dissertation is to present a framework and regulator design for output regulation of linear hybrid systems with periodic jump times. The term output regulation is normally used in regards to the problem of regulating an error variable of a system in the presence of an exogenous system (exosystem). This problem comes up in the context of tracking a trajectory or rejecting a disturbance that can be modeled as the output of a dynamical system (the exosystem). This framework of output regulation can be useful in attempting to asymptotically track trajectories that cannot be produced by continuous-time dynamical system, such as a spline trajectory, for which an example is provided. Furthermore, the use of an internal model allows one to achieve robust output regulation. In this context, robust output regulation means maintaining output regulation despite uncertain parameters in the plant.",,,
449,"Monazite Trace-Element and Isotopic Signatures of Ultrahigh-Pressure Metamorphism: Examples from the Western Gneiss Region, Norway","Sr and common Pb in monazite provide a tool for constraining the timing and duration of high-pressure processes within Earth's crust. More generally, Sr in monazite is a potential indicator of feldspar instability and may be applicable in other geologic settings, such as igneous systems in which the abundance of feldspar changes due to melting and crystallization. Sr measurements can be incorporated into geochronology workflows using the Sr concentrations calculated for monazite reference materials 44069 and Bananeira. Monazite from six samples contains up to 3 % common Pb, resulting in discordant U-Pb analyses. These high-common-Pb monazites are characterized by high Sr, weak Eu anomalies, and low Y+HREE. This composition is consistent with (ultra)high-pressure metamorphism during which feldspar (the largest reservoir for Eu and Sr) was absent, and the modal abundance of garnet (the largest reservoir of Y and HREE) was highest. Monazite U-Pb and trace-element data were gathered using LASS (laser-ablation split-stream ICP-MS) from the Western Gneiss Region, Norway, to investigate the petrologic significance of monazite trace-element compositions and to better understand the timing of (ultra)high-pressure (UHP) metamorphism during the Caledonian Orogeny.",,,
450,"Evaluating Mechanisms for Rare Earth Element (REE) Mineralization in Proterozoic Gneiss, Music Valley, California","Zircon from a porphyritic hornblende diorite pluton exposed in the northern part of the MVR also yield an age of 165 Ma, suggesting a genetic link between emplacement of this intrusive suite and melting of the Pinto Gneiss to form the pegmatite veins. Based on the similarity in ages between monazite, xenotime and zircon in the Pinto Gneiss, along with relict 'igneous' zoning in the ore-bearing phosphate minerals, REE mineralization is interpreted to have occurred during crystallization of the igneous protolith of the Pinto Gneiss. Diorite/amphibolite emplacement at _1.4 Ga and pegmatite genesis at _165 Ma post-date the main phase of REE mineralization, but likely played a role in fluid-assisted alteration of the ore bodies and partial resetting of monazite and xenotime ages in the Pinto Gneiss. Textures inferred to be the result of dissolution re-precipitation reactions overprint relict oscillatory zoning with xenotime and uranothorite [(U,Th)SiO4 ] forming from the breakdown of monazite and monazite and uranothorite forming from the breakdown of xenotime, suggesting late-stage fluid mediated alteration of the ore minerals. Localized breakdown of monazite, anorthite and biotite to apatite and allanite provides further evidence for post-mineralization metasomatism of the ore bodies. In-situ monazite and xenotime U-Pb geochronology constrains REE mineralization to _1.71 Ga, consistent with zircon dates obtained from the Pinto Gneiss. Zircon from the diorite/amphibolite are _1.4 Ga, inferred to represent the emplacement age of this unit, whereas zircon in the pegmatite veins yield ages of _1.65Ma. Monazite [(LREE)PO4] and xenotime [(HREE,Y)PO4] occur in ore-grade concentrations within the Pinto Gneiss in the Music Valley region (MVR) of southern California. However, both the age and petrogenesis of this potentially economically significant rare earth element (REE) deposit remain uncertain. A combined petrologic and geochronologic study yields insight into the textural and temporal relationships between REE mineralization and the host rock. Ore-forming monazite and xenotime are typically restricted to biotite folia within the host Pinto Gneiss with highest modal abundances occurring within a few meters of contacts between the host gneiss and a diorite/amphibolite intrusive unit, the latter of which is cross-cut by pegmatite veins that appear to have been generated by partial melting of the Pinto Gneiss. Ore-forming monazite and xenotime preserve complex internal elemental zoning.",,,
451,"Crustal extension and magmatism during the mid-Cenozoic ignimbrite flare-up in the Guazapares Mining District and Cerocahui basin regions, northern Sierra Madre Occidental, western Chihuahua, Mexico","Three informal formations are identified in the study area: (1) the ca. 27.5 Ma Parajes formation, a ~1-km-thick succession of primarily welded silicic outflow ignimbrite sheets erupted from sources within ~50--100 km of the study area that were active during the Early Oligocene pulse of the mid-Cenozoic ignimbrite flare-up; (2) the ca. 27--24.5 Ma Temoris formation, composed primarily of locally erupted mafic-intermediate lavas and associated intrusions with interbedded alluvial deposits, likely related to rocks of the Southern Cordillera basaltic andesite province that were intermittently erupted across all of the northern Sierra Madre Occidental following the Early Oligocene ignimbrite pulse; and (3) the ca. 24.5--23 Ma Sierra Guazapares formation, composed of silicic vent to proximal facies ignimbrites, lavas, plugs, and reworked equivalents that record the initiation of explosive and effusive silicic fissure magmatism in the study area during the Early Miocene pulse of the mid-Cenozoic ignimbrite flare-up. The Guazapares Mining District and Cerocahui basin regions share this stratigraphy, but the rocks in the Cerocahui basin consist of a much higher proportion of alluvial deposits. The timing of extensional faulting and magmatism in the Guazapares Mining District and Cerocahui regions is consistent with regional-scale Middle Eocene to Early Miocene southwestward migration of active volcanism and extension in the northern Sierra Madre Occidental. Extension accompanied mafic-intermediate and silicic volcanism in the study area, and overlapped with the peak of mid-Cenozoic ignimbrite flare-up in the Sierra Madre Occidental; this supports the interpretation that there is likely a relationship between lithospheric extension and silicic large igneous province magmatism. Silicic large igneous provinces are significant in the geologic record, due to their unusually extensive areal coverage (>100,000 km2) and large volumes (>250,000 km3), and may be characteristic of continental regions undergoing broad lithospheric extension. The Sierra Madre Occidental of northwestern Mexico is the biggest and best-preserved silicic large igneous province of the Cenozoic and is considered part of the extensive mid-Cenozoic ignimbrite flare-up that affected much of the southwestern North American Cordillera. Despite its size and preservation, very little is known about the geology of the Sierra Madre Occidental, and the timing and spatial extent of ignimbrite flare-up volcanism in relation to crustal extension is relatively unknown. This study presents new geologic mapping, stratigraphy, zircon U-Pb laser ablation ICP-MS dating, modal analysis, and geochemical data from the Guazapares Mining District and Cerocahui basin regions, two adjacent areas of the northern Sierra Madre Occidental in western Chihuahua. The rock exposure and topographic relief in this previously unmapped ~450 km2 area make it ideal for studying the relationships between silicic large igneous province volcanism and crustal extension. The main geologic structures in the Guazapares Mining District and Cerocahui basin regions are NNW-trending normal faults, with an estimated minimum of 20% total horizontal extension. Many normal faults bound half-graben basins that show evidence of syndepositional extension. Normal faulting began by ca. 27.5 Ma during deposition of the youngest ignimbrites of the Parajes formation, concurrent with the end of the Early Oligocene silicic ignimbrite pulse of the ignimbrite flare-up to the east and before magmatism began in the study area. Preexisting normal faults localized mafic-intermediate volcanic vents of the Temoris formation and silicic vents of the Sierra Guazapares formation, and were active during deposition of these formations. In addition, the localization and timing of epithermal mineralization in the Guazapares Mining District appears to be favored where pre-to-synvolcanic extensional structures are in close association with Sierra Guazapares formation rhyolite plugs.",,,
452,"Employing Africa in the Broadway Musical: Artistic Labors and Contested Meanings of the Racial Body, from 1903 to 2009","My dissertation looks at representations of Africa throughout Broadway's history in order to explore how these stagings have both supported and challenged racial discrimination, and how they help us reconsider the shared cultural heritage of American musical theater. I investigate how black laboring bodies claimed agency and forged new communities on Broadway stages over ten decades, despite other scholars' notions of Broadway as inherently ""white space"". My method combines ethnography, spatial-visual and semiotic analysis to explore how the theatrical black body has re-shaped American social and political imagination through musical stage performances. These performances, in turn, re-circulate in global networks in ways that both challenge and re-affirm the domination of American cultural influences and the ""Otherness"" of black Africanity within the genre of the musical. Ultimately, I demonstrate that there is a long and continuing tradition within the commercial American theater of utilizing a staged vision of Africa for various ends. As significant as it is to acknowledge the challenging, bold gestures made by a number of Broadway's theater artists, it is also important to show, finally, that the entire trajectory of musical theater has developed in conversation with an African Other and an imagined African space (be it a threatening pagan jungle or prehistoric paradise). No matter how progressive, most musical theater histories to date still affirm black musical theater and artists as an additive, rather than reexamining musical theater history as a conversation about race from its inception. My dissertation intervenes in critical race theory, citizenship studies, musical theater studies and performance studies by showing how Africa-focused musicals function as under-acknowledged and progressive social change vehicles in the United States.",,,
453,Targeting Prosodic Atypicalities Using Self-Management for Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders,"There is a considerable amount of literature reporting prosody is atypical in most individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), however there is almost no literature addressing interventions for improving these prosodic atypicialities. This study used a concurrent multiple baseline design to assess whether adults with ASD could be taught appropriate prosody within the context of a self-management program. Additionally, the study assessed whether improvements in prosody would generalize outside of the intervention setting to the participants' natural environments. Data showed improvements in prosody in the clinical setting following intervention with generalization for two of three participants across settings and conversational partners. Long-term generalization occurred for all the three participants, as well. Further, a six-point normalcy scale was used to assess whether naive observers scored any collateral gains in how natural participants' general conversations sounded before and following the intervention. These observers rated the conversation as sounding more natural following intervention. Finally, data were collected to assess the participants' acceptability of the intervention, which participants found intervention helpful and unstressful. Results indicate that self-management may be an effective strategy for improving prosody in adults with ASD.",,,
454,The Structure of Fundamental Groups of Smooth Metric Measure Spaces,"In this dissertation, we investigate the structure of fundamental groups of smooth metric measure spaces with Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor bounded from below. In particular, we generalize a result of Gabjin Yun to show that if a smooth metric measure space has almost nonnegative Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor and a lower bound on volume, then its fundamental group is almost abelian. We also generalize a result of Vitali Kapovitch and Burkhard Wilking to show that there is a uniform bound on the number of generators of the fundamental groups of smooth metric measure spaces with Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor bounded from below. In order to utilize the proof techniques of Yun and Kapovitch-Wilking, we extend many valuable tools for studying Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded from below to the smooth metric measure space setting. In particular, we extend Jeff Cheeger and Tobias Colding's Splitting Theorem, which plays a key role in the proofs of our results on fundamental groups.",,,
455,Unipotent Radicals of the Standard Borel and Parabolic Subgroups in Quantum Special Linear Groups,"In this dissertation we find noncommutative analogues of the coordinate rings of the unipotent radicals of the standard Borel and standard parabolic subgroups in quantum special linear groups. In each case, two subalgebras are defined, both of which can be considered quantizations of the unipotent radical of a standard Borel or a standard parabolic subgroup. Presentations are given for these algebras. It is also shown that these algebras arise as a coinvariant subalgebra of a natural comodule algebra action induced from the Hopf algebra structure on quantum special linear groups.",,,
456,Association between a dopamine transporter polymorphism and fractional anisotropy in the substantia nigra: a diffusion tensor imaging study,"Previous research has shown that fractional anisotropy (FA) is significantly less in the substantia nigra (SN) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) relative to controls. This is likely indicative of dopamine (DA) cell loss, which in turn likely reflects a co-occuring loss of dopamine transporter (DAT). In the present diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study, it was hypothesized that differences in DAT genotype in a healthy population would also be associated with differences in FA within the SN. Specifically, it was hypothesized that the 9/9 genotype would be associated with increased FA values relative to the 9/10 or 10/10 genotype within the mid-dorsal caudal (MDC) SN. In 82 subjects (5 9/9 genotype, 36 9/10 genotype, and 41 10/10 genotype), a significant difference was found between the 9/9 and 9/10 groups within the MDC SN ROI (p = .027). No significant FA differences were found between the 9/9 and 10/10 groups (p = .306). As expected, no FA differences were found in the control region of the cerebral peduncle in the 9/9 versus the 9/10 or 10/10 group (p = .382 and p = .344, respectively). Additionally, no differences were found in MDC SN FA for control genotype, serotonin transporter (SERT) (p = .836), which was hypothesized not to be associated with microstructural MDC SN differences. These results demonstrate that normal genetic variation can influence brainstem FA values, which might reflect dopamine transporter (DAT) site-specific changes in cell structure, showing that SN FA values may be used as a potential DAT density marker and biomarker for DAT related cognitive performance and disease states.",,,
457,Franz Liszt's Song Revisions: A Schenkerian Taxonomy,"This study relies on the Schenkerian analytical model to systematically examine Liszt's songs, an uncommon and innovative approach for a variety of reasons. Schenker did not discuss or analyze Liszt's music; he likely dismissed it along with other ""progressive"" composers who undermined traditional compositional principles. However, I use the Ursatz as an idealized structure and recognize its enduring presence though Liszt's revisions to establish a method of comparative analysis. By using an analytical method focused on a sub-surface compositional structure, we gain insight into Liszt's revisional process and more accurately determine if there is a line of continuity between two works. The central issue I explore is Liszt's composition and publication of multiple versions of a song with the same text. The goal of this study is a comparative analysis in which I highlight commonalities and divergences between versions in order to illuminate their relationships. Common compositional frameworks allow us to trace a line of composition from a song's genesis to final form. Dissimilar frameworks help us examine Liszt's exploration of new musical ideas and creative impulses for a text he previously used. I then classify these revisions in three-part taxonomy to account for compositional variants. By performing such a comparative analysis, we gain a more intimate understanding both of Liszt's compositional style and the underlying dialogue that exists between these works. Franz Liszt was one of the most dynamic and influential musicians of the nineteenth century. His influence on piano performance, pedagogy, and composition altered the musical world for future generations, yet this is not the sum of his accomplishments. Certain aspects of his compositional output still require a great deal of attention from both scholars and performers. The aim of this study is to examine one such neglected topic, Liszt's songs.",,,
458,Evolution and Process in Elliott Carter's String Quartets,"Musical expression in the Second String Quartet (1959) evolved from Carter's explorations in the First. Chapter 2 examines the similarities between the two quartets and the crucial differences that set this work apart from its predecessor. I argue that the Second Quartet is the piece in which Carter solidified his harmonic language, through his experimentation with serialization, as well as borrowing compositional techniques of other composers, namely Bela Bartok and Anton Webern. The First String Quartet (1951) was written at a time when Carter became increasingly interested in new and unusual ideas, which stem from his interest in time perception. Seeking new ways to address this notion musically, Carter turned to the modernist literature, primarily Marcel Proust. Chapter 1 examines Carter's First Quartet from the perspective of Proustian time: the superimposition of multiple temporal strands and the role memory plays in relating all events in time and space. For Carter, the audience's experience was the most important factor in the Third String Quartet (1971). Chapter 3 examines the ways space relates to music. It also tracks the development of the concept of spatialization in Carter's music by looking at his earlier works (the first two quartets, the Double Concerto and the Concerto for Orchestra), as well as evaluating the spatial techniques of Carter's initial source---Charles Ives. In Chapter 5, I examine how Carter's choice of harmonic, intervallic and rhythmic constraints, combined with the development of a conceptually novel form, reflect the composer's aesthetic objectives and technical preferences in his Fifth String Quartet (1995). In addition to the novelties in his technical language, I shed light on Carter's meta-compositional concept in this piece---this final quartet is not only a composition in itself, but it captures the processes of a rehearsal, discussion, analysis, and performance, all working together to reveal the composition. Chapter 4 focuses on sketch study to decipher the rhythmic, harmonic, and formal designs of the Fourth String Quartet (1986). My examination reveals a logical hierarchical system in Carter's compositional process, starting with a long-range polyrhythmic outline of the piece, adding distinct intervallic constraints to each instrument, and lastly forming a general effect of the piece. I argue that by the time Carter finished sketching the rhythmic, harmonic, and formal elements, he had already conceived the entire quartet, and was ready to write out the piece in a nearly fair-copy format. My dissertation examines compositional process in Elliott Carter's five string quartets. Because Carter composed five quartets over a period of five decades (1951-1995), it creates an advantageous setting to systematically explore the stylistic changes within the same genre. Supplementing my analyses with sketch study, correspondence, and text manuscripts, I shed new light on the understanding of each quartet individually, and draw conclusions on their collective meaning and place in Carter's evolving compositional processes.",,,
460,Huskerdom: Nebraska Football Fans and American Religion,"Building on previous approaches to studying sports culture as it relates to religion, this dissertation employs a definition of religion as ""lived orientation"" to explore the religiosity of Nebraska football fandom. Citing data gathered from Internet message boards, in-person questionnaires, and interviews, this dissertation traces Husker fans' varied relationships with the Nebraska football program's history, coaches, and traditions. Further, in its investigation of Husker fans' negotiation of identity as either ""true"" fans or as ""the greatest"" fans in college football, this dissertation outlines aspects of the community's code of expected behavior. By examining the ways Nebraska football fandom plays a powerful role in orienting fans' everyday lives, this dissertation highlights the themes of family, memory, and desire in Husker fan experience, and argues for continued scholarly recognition of fandom as a significant manifestation of American religion.",,,
461,Middle censoring in the presence of covariates,"Simulation studies are performed to demonstrate the usefulness and accuracy of the methods developed here, and illustrated with a practical example using data from a Stanford Heart Transplant study. In survival studies the values of some covariates may change over time. As such, it is natural to incorporate such time-dependent covariates into the model to be used in survival analysis. The model used in this research integrates both time-independent and time-dependent covariates for middle censored data. Both semiparametric and parametric models are considered when time-dependent covariates are present. Next, discrete lifetime data that follow a geometric distribution, that is subject to middle censoring is considered. Here, we include an extension and generalization to the case where covariates are present and present an alternate approach and proofs which exploit the simple relationship between the geometric and exponential distributions. Also, considered are estimation problems for middle censored data with two independent competing risks, both for parametric and semiparametric context. Middle censoring refers to data that becomes unobservable if it falls within a random interval (L,R). For some individuals the exact values are available while for others the corresponding intervals of censorship are observed. Left censoring, right censoring and double censoring are special cases of this middle censoring by suitable choices of this censoring interval. Here, we develop new methods for analyzing data subject to middle-censoring when covariates are present. The techniques discussed include parametric models as well as semi-parametric models such as the Cox's Proportional Hazards model and the Accelerated Failure Times model.",,,
462,Isometries of the Hilbert Metric,On any convex domain in Rn we can define the Hilbert metric. A projective transformation is an example of an isometry of the Hilbert metric. In this thesis we will prove that the group of projective transformations on a convex domain has at most index 2 in the group of isometries of the convex domain with its Hilbert metric. Furthermore we will give criteria for which the set of projective transformations between two convex domains is equal to the set of isometries of the Hilbert metric of these convex domains. Lastly we will show that 2-dimensional convex domains with their corresponding Hilbert metrics are isometric if and only if they are projectively equivalent.,,,
463,"(Re)Presenting Women in France, 1490-1510: Translations of Texts and Images","Finally, Chapter IV examines how translators manipulated religious and profane depictions of women, based on a text that associates females and madness through the lens of the five senses. Jehan Drouyn's La Nef des folles, a 1498 translation, of Josse Bade's Stultiferae naves (The Ship of Female Fools), published ca. 1500, reflects a cross-cultural line of adaptation that can be traced back to Sebastian Brant's 1494 Das Narrenschiff (The Ship of Fools). As a printed text, La Nef des folles addressed a much wider audience than Les Vies des femmes celebres and the multiple manuscript versions of the XXI Epistres d'Ovide examined in Chapters II and III. The woodcuts contained in La Nef des folles also integrate and modify earlier depictions of male and female fools, most notably those from Sebastian Brant's German editions. An analysis of the images in La Nef des folles as translations of Brant's text and of its woodcuts provides further analysis of how this printed edition adapted earlier portraits of women within the realm of literature. In Chapter I, I provide a brief summary of medieval reading practices and medieval authorship, ultimately arguing that medieval translation's emphases on compilatio and ennarratio parallel in many ways the interpretation and adaptation of previous works performed by medieval authors. I also examine the images included in several different versions of Les XXI Epistres, and the manner in which these feminine portraits convey specific ideals of women and female readership. I apply concepts of translation theory, both from the earlier medieval period and from current scholarship, to specific translations for, about, and, I argue, of women. In some interpretations of the act of translation, women and copies are viewed as inferior to men and source texts. This is a view of translation that the late-medieval French translators examined below consciously or unconsciously replaced or refuted, sometimes even employing their translation as a vehicle for their argument against their source text (as in the case of Antoine Dufour's text) and asserting the auctoritas and worth of the copy (for example, the XXI Epistres d'Ovide) over the original (Ovid's Heroides). If the translators's revisions implicitly argue for the superiority of the translation over the copy, and if the copy and women are one and the same, then one might reason that, consciously or unconsciously, the translators also argue for the superiority of women over men. In Chapter II, I discuss a prominent subject in late 15th-century literature: ""the famous woman topos."" By this period, la querelle des femmes, a debate sparked by Christine de Pizan's reading of the Roman de la Rose as an act of misogyny, was in full swing, and this debate can highlight for us the extent to which attitudes about women were being reevaluated in literary works. I examine the ways in which the translator Antoine Dufour acted as compiler of two previous works of literature, Giovanni Boccaccio's De mulieribus claris and Giacomo Filipo Foresti da Bergamo's De plurimis claris selectisque mulieribus, in presenting his translations in French about famous women. A careful examination of both the text and the images in the queen's manuscript of Les Vies des femmes celebres (Nantes, musee Dobree, ms. 17; ca. 1506) shows in different ways how the text was written for Anne and her female entourage, and how Dufour shaped his work in order to present women in a more favorable light than his source texts. Chapter III focuses on how translators were able to manipulate literary conceptions of female virtue and vice by manipulating their Latin texts. Les XXI Epistres d'Ovide was translated into French by Octovien de Saint-Gelais ca. 1497 from Ovid's Heroides. Although dedicated to a male, King Charles VIII, many manuscript copies of this work were produced for and owned by noble women of the time. Through a careful comparison of key passages in the two versions, I show how, through interpretation and adaptation, Saint-Gelais significantly alters the Latin source, and uses his role as translator in transforming Ovid's images of women in verbal terms. While the women pictured in his work were largely predicated on a misogynistic view of women as the originators and cause of all human sin, Drouyn's address to women readers furnishes the core of this project. Whether the readers of the literary works studied here would have agreed with the ways in which women were depicted within their pages is not presently at issue. Rather, the fact that these works contain depictions of women aimed directly at female readers can reveal for us the ways in which translators sought to simultaneously define and address the female sex.

465,First-principles investigations of III-nitride bulk and surface properties,"Despite the plethora of attractive material parameters of the III-nitride materials there are several issues that significantly limit the efficiency of devices and range of possible applications. In this study, we use first-principles electronic structure calculations to explore several of these properties relevant to understanding growth, processing, and device design. The III-nitride semiconductors, including AlN, InN, GaN, and BN have been demonstrated as technologically exciting materials for a wide range of device applications. With band gaps that span the visible range, GaN, InN, and InGaN alloys are used for high efficiency light emitting diodes for general lighting, as well as laser diodes for optical storage. The wide gaps, large band offsets, and polarization fields in AlN, GaN, and AlGaN alloys are promising for high-frequency, high-power transistors with applications in power conversion and radio frequency amplifiers. There has been significant work done to overcome the issue of residual strains in III-nitride films, both through the growth of bulk crystals for substrates, and the growth of structures such as nanowires that avoid many of the thickness and alloy-content limitations of epitaxial layers. Also, selective area growth followed by lateral overgrowth techniques is used to produce high-quality GaN for laser applications. In all of these cases, growth involves multiple growth planes, and the resulting morphologies will be determined by the relative growth rates of the planes present. One of the fundamental parameters that determines the stability and growth rate on a given plane is the absolute surface energies of that plane. Calculations of such surface energies are extremely challenging; we have succeeded in obtaining such values, for the first time, for the most technologically important planes in GaN. Finally, residual stresses contribute to a piezoelectric polarization moment in the III-nitrides in the most common growth direction, and even in the absence of such strain, the wurtzite crystal structure has a spontaneous polarization moment. Polarization differences between layers of heterostructures allow for strong carrier confinement and the formation of two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with high densities at AlGaN/GaN interfaces, exploited in high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). The effect of polarization can also be detrimental, for example causing the quantum confined Stark effect in quantum wells of light emitting diodes (LEDs). In both HEMT and LED devices, accurate values of the magnitudes of the spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization constants are required for a fundamental understanding and design of III-nitride devices. We have discovered that the set of spontaneous polarization coefficients that has been widely used for device design and analysis suffers from inconsistencies in the choice of reference structure, and have derived a new reliable and accurate set of constants to describe the polarization properties of III-nitrides. We discuss the results in the context of experimental observations. Arguably the most detrimental issue in this material system is the lack of widely available, cost-effective substrates for the growth of films and devices. Heteroepitaxy, as well as the lattice mismatch between the layers of different III-nitride alloys in heterostructures, results in residual stresses in films and devices. Such stress will alter the electronic structure of the materials, so it is necessary for device design to be able to quantify these effects. We explore the influence of strain on the effective mass of carriers in GaN and AlN, a parameter that is tied to the conductivity. In addition, films under tensile strain can crack if the strain energy is sufficient. We explore the propensity for AlN, GaN, and AlGaN to crack on different crystallographic planes.",,,
466,Individual Liability and Structural Injustice: Constructing Responsibility and Punishment in Poverty Discourse,"Discussions of personal responsibility are central to conservative U.S. efforts to restructure welfare and restrict the use of public safety net programs. These discourses rely on a neoliberal framing of responsibility as individual liability. In this thesis, I use the tools of discourse analysis to examine how responsibility for poverty is discussed within public and political discourses. In particular, I examine discourses and counter-discourses around Tennessee Senate Bill 132, a 2013 proposal to make families' welfare benefits contingent on children's academic performances. I argue that responses presented in opposition to this proposal rely on the same narrow conceptions of responsibility that are deployed by the bill's supporters. While these opposing discourses ultimately blame different parties, their parallel attempts to identify blameworthy individuals show how the liability model privileges individual responses of surveillance and punishment over structural analyses. This limited framework of responsibility is further reinforced by affective investment and sedimented attitudes about gender and race. I present a material and structural account of poverty in Tennessee as an alternative to these discourses.",,,
467,A Parallel Tree Implementation for Long Range Interactions,"Presented is a treecode implemented in C++ for the computation of long range interactions. This treecode is applied to three dimensional systems containing large numbers of particles. Although the approach is applicable to more general kernel functions, the kernel functions considered here are of the form, r-alpha, for alpha<3, where r is the distance between two particles. The direct implementation for computing the pairwise interactions, for a system of n particles, results in O(n2) operations, which is prohibitively expensive for large systems. The presented treecode reduces the cost to O(n log n) . Furthermore, the treecode is parallelized using MPI, which further reduces the cost to O(n log n / p), where P is the number of MPI processes.",,,
468,"Graphic Positioning Systems: Global Comics, Radical Literacies","This dissertation asks how comics allow us to rethink the imagination and representation of the world and its inhabitants. I argue that by making questions of translation visible, comics provide tools to rethink world literacies. Rather than utilize comics to create a more universal world literature I use comics to map out spaces of untranslatability, misrecognition, and resistance. This investigation considers comics in three dimensions, theorizing beyond the representational and the semantic in order to assemble reading models attentive to geopolitical and historical locations. If we think of the page as but one component of the encounter a reader makes with a media object, how might we implicate other components of that encounter in new considerations of the local and the global? My research focuses on comics from a variety of linguistic, cultural, and historical positions. Advocating for decolonial and feminist literacies, I apply theoretical frameworks provided by Judith Butler, Rey Chow, Hillary Chute, Johanna Drucker, Donna Haraway, Caren Kaplan, Gayatri Spivak, et al., to global comics, including Herge's Tintin, Joe Sacco's Palestine, Charles Burns' X'ed Out, Mazen Kerbaj's Une semaine sans la voix de Samir, Zeina Abrached's A Game for Swallows: To Die, to Leave, to Return, Magdy El Shafee's Metro, and Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis. My project locates these works geopolitically, while drawing attention to the historical and material conditions of their production and dissemination. Each chapter explores a different technological paradigm: othering, targeting, humanizing, and mapping. The first chapter is guided by the question, what are the medial conditions of possibility for generating legibility of self and other? Drawing from post-colonial theory, I use Tintin to examine how colonial ideology underpins reading modalities and enables legible demarcations of difference. The second chapter furthers the project's investigation of identity and difference to consider targeting as a form of verbal/visual knowledge production. Comics function as frames that may, through stereotype, target the other. Conversely, comics provide self-reflexive frames that can be used to critically intercede in verbal/visual epistemological regimes. The third chapter considers how boundaries between and within corporeal entities might be reimaged and reimagined. I scrutinize the technology of humanizing and the ways in which human animals, works of art, and systems of knowledge are recognized and delineated as such. I conclude by considering comics in terms of cartographic technology in order to locate the feedback loop between the translation and reception of comics and transnational media flows. The circulation of comics depends on highly delimited discursive locations as well as highly mobile object orientations. By analyzing comics as graphic positioning systems I reframe maps of cultural and capital networks, and trace the capacity of media objects to locate subject positions. I argue that by using comics as a tool in order to theorize the tensions between locative identities and media technologies, we may develop radical literacies to intervene in the world of global mediascapes.",,,
469,"The Intersection of Sample Size, Number of Indicators, and Class Enumeration in LCA: A Monte Carlo Study","All data were generated and analyzed using Mplus latent variable software (Muthen & Muthen, 1998-2013). The specific data generation and analysis conditions in this dissertation were created based on a literature search of Education and Psychology related databases. Results from this study will help applied researchers using LCA models further understand which fit index to trust under various conditions when going through the class enumeration process in practice. Specifically, the ABIC and BLRT indices emerged as being the highest performing across a variety of conditions considered in this study. Results also highlight the practical importance of thoughtfully considering sample size and the number of indicators included when estimating and interpreting LCA models. Findings of this dissertation provide evidence for a relatively strong interplay between sample size, number of indicators, and class enumeration in LCA models. This Monte Carlo simulation study examined the performance of the most commonly used fit indices in selecting the ""correct"" latent class model while varying factors such as: the true number of latent classes, the size of the latent classes (i.e., class prevalence), the nature of the latent classes, the number of indicators, and sample size. Specifically, the fit indices examined in this simulation study were the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Consistent Akaike Information Criterion (CAIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the adjusted Bayesian Information Criterion (ABIC), the adjusted Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test (LMR-LRT), the parametric bootstrapped likelihood ratio test (BLRT), the approximate Bayes Factor (BF), and the correct model probability (cmP). No study to date has examined the performance of the BF and cmP in recovering the correct latent class model. This simulation study also aimed to simultaneously examine and understand how sample size, the number of observed indicators, and class enumeration intersect in latent class analysis (LCA) models. In other words, when sampling observations from a larger population, is there a critical point where the size of the sample and the number of indicators cannot uncover all existing heterogeneity? That is, at what point is specificity of the emerging latent classes lost?",,,
470,"Part One: The Dramatic Function of Off-Stage Music in Bizet's ""Carmen"" Part Two: A Portfolio of Compositions","In this dissertation, I explore the dramatic function of each off-stage musical instance in the opera. I also include analyses of other musical and dramatic passages that are either related to the off-stage passages, or to themes of space and distance. I conclude that Bizet's continuous use of off-stage music heightens the dramatic tension of each act and ultimately propels the drama toward the final scene. Thus, when Bizet uses off-stage music in the final scene, he is able to create eerie, disturbing on-stage silences that frame the tragic ending. Part One: Why does everyone love George Bizet's Carmen? What does Bizet do, both musically and dramatically, to make this timeless work of art so effective? In Part I of this dissertation, I focus an aspect of these questions, namely, what makes the final scene, Don Jose and Carmen's last duet, so powerful? How does Bizet create an atmosphere of utter despair? I believe the answer lies in part with Bizet's use of off-stage music. Part Two: Part II of my dissertation is a portfolio of compositions. The majority of these works were presented during my Ph.D. recital on June 3, 2012. A Game was played by the UCSB symphony during their winter term concert in 2009. UCSB's Ensemble for Contemporary Music programmed Quilt I on a concert in late May 2012.",,,
471,Computing Volumes and Convex Hulls: Variations and Extensions,"The second part of the thesis investigates the convex hull problem on uncertain input. To this extent, we examine two probabilistic uncertainty models for point sets. The first model incorporates uncertainty in the existence of the input points. The second model extends the first one by incorporating locational uncertainty. For both models, we study the problem of computing the probability that a given point is contained in the convex hull of the uncertain points. We also consider the problem of finding the most likely convex hull, i.e., the mode of the convex hull random variable. In the first part of the thesis, we investigate several practical and natural variations of Klee's Measure Problem. We develop a specialized algorithm for a specific case of Klee's problem called the ""grounded"" case, which also solves the Hypervolume Indicator problem faster than any earlier solution for certain dimensions. Next, we extend Klee's problem to an uncertainty setting where the existence of the input boxes are defined probabilistically, and study computing the expectation of the volume. Additionally, we develop efficient algorithms for a discrete version of the problem, where the volume of a box is redefined to be the cardinality of its overlap with a given point set. Geometric techniques are frequently utilized to analyze and reason about multi-dimensional data. When confronted with large quantities of such data, simplifying geometric statistics or summaries are often a necessary first step. In this thesis, we make contributions to two such fundamental concepts of computational geometry: Klee's Measure and Convex Hulls. The former is concerned with computing the total volume occupied by a set of overlapping rectangular boxes in d-dimensional space, while the latter is concerned with identifying extreme vertices in a multi-dimensional set of points. Both problems are frequently used to analyze optimal solutions to multi-objective optimization problems: a variant of Klee's problem called the Hypervolume Indicator gives a quantitative measure for the quality of a discrete Pareto Optimal set, while the Convex Hull represents the subset of solutions that are optimal with respect to at least one linear optimization function.",,,
472,Effects of nonlinguistic context on language production,"Recent usage-based approaches to linguistic theory have claimed that linguistic processing is driven by domain-general cognitive abilities which operate on a rich memory store that retains all the details of every experience with language, extracting patterns from these experiences purely on the basis of regular patterning. It has also been claimed that these mechanisms operate similarly on all levels of linguistic structure and at all stages of the human lifespan. Taken together, these claims imply the hypothesis that any dimension of experience can influence the linguistic knowledge and behavior of any language user. This dissertation tests this hypothesis. A series of experiments were conducted, each consisting of a prime phase and a test phase, using native English-speaking participants. In the prime phase, participants were exposed to combinations of linguistic structures (active and passive voice) and nonlinguistic contextual elements (colors, background music, sounds, or physical environments). The linguistic and nonlinguistic components of the experiences so created bore no semantic relationship to one another, but the pattern of cooccurrence between them was completely regular and reliable, such that, for each experimental participant, a particular syntactic voice always occurred in a particular nonlinguistic context. Participants then performed a picture description task, in which each picture was accompanied by one of the nonlinguistic contexts to which they had previously been exposed. The hypothesis was that, when describing each picture, participants should be more likely to use the syntactic voice which had previously been associated with the nonlinguistic context which accompanied the picture. This hypothesis was not supported by the data. Instead, it was found that the only consistently significant factor influencing the syntactic voice of participants' responses was the syntactic voice of their own previous responses: people were more likely to keep using whatever voice they had already been using. In addition, in every experiment, it was found that the results were most accurately characterized by an extremely simple model using only subject-specific and picture-specific baseline response rates. These results suggest that usage-based theories have been overly optimistic in asserting that regular patterns of experience alone are sufficient to explain linguistic knowledge and behavior. Instead, it is argued that more specific constraints on linguistic processing mechanisms are needed in order to provide a fullfledged, causal account of how people's experiences affect their mental representations of language.",,,
473,"Iron Mothers and Warrior Lovers: Intimacy, Power, and the State in the Nyiginya Kingdom, 1796-1913","I evaluate the historical construction of social identity by illustrating the importance of regional and family identities, and how gender identity and rank complicate these ideas even further. I challenge the conventional periodization of African history, which has centered the experience of colonialism as the defining event for African societies. Instead, I propose an approach to colonial history that treats European conquest as one of many important social and political upheavals that involved negotiation, adaptation, and resistance on the part of African polities. Finally, I place precolonial African history within a global context, drawing comparisons with cultures in East Asia, Latin America, and Europe, in order to emphasize African history's vital contribution to world history. 1895-1931), who has become the iconic image of the Tutsi monarchy for both supporters and detractors over the course of the post-colonial period. My research refocuses the historiography of the late Rwandan monarchy, which has previously centered on kings, warriors, and male ritual practitioners, to its women rulers as a way to illustrate the importance of clanship to the development of kinship. Further, I raise larger questions about the nature of monarchy and its sometimes perilous reliance upon a network of intimate relationships, and argue that this system is constructed in part out of what feminist scholars have labeled ""intimate labors."" My research advances the current discourse within Rwandan studies about the nature of social identity in the period immediately prior to and during the early decades of colonial rule. This dissertation explores the development of the role of the Queen Mother in the Nyiginya kingdom between 1796 and 1913. Using case studies of four Queen Mothers immediately preceding the onset of Belgian colonial rule, I examine how they manipulated changing social and political circumstances to increase their own power bases, transforming the nature of the monarchy itself. Through oral historical narratives, royal rituals, colonial accounts, and local and family histories I reveal a social order in flux, and a monarchical system increasingly dependent upon intimate kinship relationships. Within this context, I argue that the power of the King, relative to the Queen Mother and other intimates, waned when faced with the innovations of joint rulership. These innovations developed in the late-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and culminated with the reign of Nyirayuhi V Kanjogera (r.",,,
474,Unbecoming: Visibility Politics and Queer Rurality,"Unbecoming: Visibility Politics and Queer Rurality critically analyzes calls for LGBTQ people to be ""out, loud, and proud"" through examining representations, discourses, and experiences of LGBTQ women in the rural Midwestern United States. Drawing from cultural representations and interviews I conducted with fifty-one women in rural South Dakota and Minnesota, I suggest that an estrangement exists between the desires, logics, and strategies of LGBTQ women in the rural Midwest and those of gay rights movements. This estrangement points to the need to consider the ideologies undergirding and the ramifications of LGBTQ visibility politics. I make three interventions in the interdisciplinary study of visibility: I argue that calls for visibility are symptomatic of and enable metronormativity, that visibility politics reproduce both post-racial and what I term post-spatial ideologies, and, finally, that becoming recognizable as visible is a labored process, and, as such, calls for LGBTQ visibility, which relentlessly demand constant laboring, are a reflection of and benefit to capitalist logics. In doing so, I revise assumptions about the ostensible relations among gay community, identity, and visibility, question the notion that visibility leads to rights or justice, and challenge dominant conceptions of the nature of rural communities. Beyond examining the unbecoming-ness of visibility discourses, I suggest that an interrogation of visibility discourses explicates how one becomes (and might un-become) a sexual subject and can broaden possibilities for actualizing alternate subjectivities--sexual or otherwise.",,,
475,"Early environmental assessments of emerging technologies: Addressing technology maturity, production scale and data representativeness","Under three distinct but related themes, this dissertation presents the frameworks for reducing and communicating various aspects of epistemic uncertainty in the life cycle assessments (LCAs) of emerging technologies as follows. (1) The uncertainty due to the immaturity of technology and differences in production scale is addressed under Theme I. The two LCAs under this theme indicate that the higher levels of technology maturity and production scale are likely to reduce environmental impacts. However, the magnitude of this reduction would depend on the aspects such as the reuse-recyclability potential of the input material and the current level of technology maturity. Additionally, it appears that this reduction may not be apparent in the assessments of the laboratory level processes if there is higher uncertainty in the technology's path to commercialization. (2) Theme II introduces a theoretical framework for fusing heterogeneous and possibly conflicting information, in order to enhance the data quality, which in turn can reduce the epistemic uncertainty. (3) Theme III addresses the communication of uncertainty in general. Existing Peer-reviewed LCAs of engineered nanomaterials provide the case study material for this theme. This study identifies the critical elements of uncertainty communication, which in itself is an essential component of effective science communication. It also proposes certain graphical presentations to effectively convey the uncertainty, mainly the epistemic uncertainty, in the LCAs of emerging technologies. I believe that assimilation of these three frameworks in the methodology of LCAs would serve in enhancing the applicability, and therefore the decision informing capacity, of the assessments. Early environmental assessments of emerging products and technologies are essential for their responsible integration in the global economy. However, at a pre-commercial stage, the data are often inadequate. This introduces epistemic uncertainty (i.e., that due to lack of information), which is more qualitative in nature, and addressing it is important for the applicability of the assessment. Additionally, the science communication literature indicates that a transparent presentation of uncertainty is important for a correct interpretation and credibility of the results. Given the high level of epistemic uncertainty in pre-commercial assessments, it is all the more important that this uncertainty not only is addressed systematically, but that its communication is made tangible to the experts and non-experts alike, especially when the topic is of public interest.",,,
476,Exotic Quantum Phases and Phase Transitions of Strongly Interacting Electrons in Low-Dimensional Systems,"Here, we attempt to circumvent some of these difficulties by studying analogous problems in quasi-one dimension. In this lower dimensional setting, theoretical and numerical tractability are on much stronger footing due to the methods of bosonization and the density matrix renormalization group, respectively. Using these techniques, we attack two problems: (1) the Mott transition between a Fermi liquid metal and a quantum spin liquid as potentially directly relevant to the organic compounds kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu 2(CN)3 and EtMe3Sb[Pd(dmit)2] 2 and (2) non-Fermi liquid metals as strongly motivated by the strange metal phase observed in the cuprates. In both cases, we are able to realize highly exotic quantum phases as ground states of reasonable microscopic models. This lends strong credence to respective underlying slave-particle descriptions of the low-energy physics, which are inherently strongly interacting and also unconventional in comparison to weakly interacting alternatives. Finally, working in two dimensions directly, we propose a new slave-particle theory which explains in a universal way many of the intriguing experimental results of the triangular lattice organic spin liquid candidates kappa-(BEDT-TTF) 2Cu2(CN)3 and EtMe3Sb[Pd(dmit) 2]2. With use of large-scale variational Monte Carlo calculations, we show that this new state has very competitive trial energy in an effective spin model thought to describe the essential features of the real materials. Experiments on strongly correlated quasi-two-dimensional electronic materials---for example, the high-temperature cuprate superconductors and the putative quantum spin liquids kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu2(CN)3 and EtMe3Sb[Pd(dmit)2]2---routinely reveal highly mysterious quantum behavior which cannot be explained in terms of weakly interacting degrees of freedom. Theoretical progress thus requires the introduction of completely new concepts and machinery beyond the traditional framework of the band theory of solids and its interacting counterpart, Landau's Fermi liquid theory. In full two dimensions, controlled and reliable analytical approaches to such problems are severely lacking, as are numerical simulations of even the simplest of model Hamiltonians due to the infamous fermionic sign problem.",,,
477,Immigrant Rights are Human Rights: Changing the Discourse on Immigration in the US,"As the world becomes more socially and economically interdependent, the movement of people is dramatically rising. With the increase in international migration, there has also been a corresponding increase in the regularization of migration at the national and international level that excludes certain groups of migrants. This thesis studies how the rights of undocumented economic immigrants in the US are not protected under national immigration law or international human rights law. My analysis of immigration policy and international human rights law shows that US immigration policy treats migrants as labor rather than human beings, and they do not address that migration is an inevitable global process. International law on the other hand, does advocate for the protection of the human rights of migrants but it has little power against national migration policies. These gaps within national and international policy to protect the rights of immigrants in the US leave non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as an alternative mechanism for migrants and immigrants to fight for their rights, particularly through grassroots NGOs. I conclude that cooperation between international human rights NGOs can help fill in the gaps in international human rights law and national immigration policy, and shift the discourse of immigration in the US to focus on a more human rights based approach.",,,
478,Identification of novel regulators of Polycystin-1 signaling,"Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a common genetic disease that results in fluid-filled cysts forming throughout the kidneys and progressive loss of renal function. Most cases of ADPKD are caused by mutations in the gene encoding Polycystin-1 (PC1), however how these mutations result in cyst formation remains unclear. Polycystin-1 is a protein with 11 transmembrane domains, a large extracellular N-terminal domain, and a short _200 amino acid cytoplasmic tail. Most proteins that interact with Polycystin-1 have been found to bind via the cytoplasmic tail. Therefore to better understand the functions of Polycystin-1, I sought to identify novel interaction partners of the PC1 tail. Using several different approaches I identified several new PC1-interacting proteins and characterize their role in PC1 signaling.",,,
480,"The Spatial Economy of British Colonial Penology in India, 1858-1911","Prison construction was among the most important infrastructural changes brought about by British rule in nineteenth-century India. It introduced India to a radically new system of punishment based on long-term incarceration. These prisons were designed to respond to the demand for a more rigorous mode of convict discipline by implementing a strict penal system based on remunerative labor. At the same time, these controlled spaces provided the British an opportunity to study and explore the bodies of Indian convicts from medical, labor, and anthropological perspectives. Visual representations of prisons and prisoners helped to codify British colonial opinions about the particular characteristics of the Indian convict, as well as the need for the prison institution in India. My dissertation studies these processes of representation through an examination of prison architecture and the spatial formations of prisons in colonial Bengal, between, 1858 and 1911, a period that witnessed critical transformations of the penal landscape. Changes included the construction of numerous central and district jails, medical management that aimed to reduce prisoner mortality, and the implementation of a streamlined program of prison labor. By analyzing the visual and architectural archive of these prisons, I propose a new spatial model for understanding how the prison both exemplifies and challenges the claims of British colonial rule. This will be first project to provide a detailed analysis of the visual corpus of colonial penology in India, particularly the architecture of colonial prisons, while at the same time demonstrating the contested character of the colonial prison.",,,
481,Porting SPICE to iOS and Loading Netlists via QR Code,"A new iOS circuit simulation app has been developed, called ""QRCircuit."" The app is designed for simulating undergraduate or graduate level amplifier configurations, filters, rectifiers, etc. It skips the schematic-based design approach to creating SPICE netlists typically seen in desktop applications and instead uses native Cocoa iOS GUI elements to enable rapid circuit prototyping and simulation. This allows the app to function more as a ""calculator"" and makes good use of the limited screen size of the iPhoneT(TM) and iPad(TM). While you can create a custom circuit netlist from scratch within the app, it has been designed from the start to provide a novel way to load netlists into it. On qrcircuit.com a repository of common netlists is provided for teaching purposes. Each circuit netlist has an accompanying QR code which goes along with it. Simply scanning the QR code in the app will load the netlist in. You can then edit, add, or remove any circuit elements or element models to your liking. It is anticipated that these QR codes will eventually be used in textbooks, PDFs, and websites to make these mediums more interactive. It is the goal of the author to eventually host every major type of circuit taught in an undergraduate or graduate curriculum this way.",,,
482,"My Neighbor the Barbarian: Immigrant Neighborhoods in Classical Athens, Imperial Rome, and Tang Chang'an","In their respective heydays, Athens, Rome, and Chang'an functioned as centers of government, economic powerhouses, global schools, sites of religious pilgrimage, and tourist attractions. Many of the diverse immigrants they attracted settled in the neighborhoods at the center of this analysis: Athens' port of Piraeus, Rome's Trans Tiberim district, and Northwest Chang'an. These communities stood out as ""small worlds"" within their cities at large, where ethnic, linguistic, and cultural differences overlapped with physical boundaries such as rivers, roads, and walls. Residents carved out places for themselves in their new homes by learning how to skillfully navigate these boundaries. Whether by traversing the urban landscape during their daily commute, participating in civic or religious ceremonies, or attending festivals and entertainments, newcomers came into contact with locals on a daily basis. These interactions blurred lines between ""us"" and ""them"" in ways that called into question the limits of national identity and, depending on the circumstances, could either fan the flames of xenophobia or nurture new cultural syntheses. In this sense, life at the center of the Athenian, Roman, and Tang empires resembled that on their outer frontiers, where ""civilized"" insiders and ""barbarian"" outsiders lived poised between intimate coexistence and violent rejection. Assessing these imperial capitals as urban borderlands allows us see that this tension was not an aberration or strictly a regional phenomenon. It was quite literally built into the heart of all three empires. How does gaining an empire change the conqueror? Why is the assimilation of new populations, goods, and ideas sometimes seen as a marker of a people's greatness, and at other times as a dangerous threat from within? This project analyzes immigration to three capital cities: Athens (5th-4 th centuries BCE), Rome (1st-4th centuries CE), and Chang'an, capital of Tang dynasty China (7th-10 th centuries CE). It analyzes ancient textual and archaeological evidence through the lens of borderland theory to argue that the boundaries surrounding immigrant neighborhoods transformed each of these iconic cities into urban borderlands where ideas of social otherness had physical analogues. It was in these urban borderlands that the problem of how to accommodate new populations into existing structures of imperial domination was worked out.",,,
483,Security Media: Speculative Fictions and Technologies of Preparedness,"I am concerned in this project not necessarily with what security media are, but rather with what they do, with how they instruct their audiences in accepting catastrophe as normal and in expecting its continual emergence. Thinking of media as processes that act on us rather than as objects means bringing different kinds of media together by emphasizing how they function. It means, for example, focusing on how fictional and nonfictional, governmental and popular media all manage political imagination in the present. By examining the many different yet overlapping forms preparedness takes, this project contributes to recent work in literary studies on the materiality and form of textual media, and to recent work in media studies that accounts for how things like digital technologies and systems become media. It shows how the media of preparedness inform one another, how they work together to govern our present response to future catastrophe. This project also, however, seeks to deform the logic of preparedness these media enact. Preparedness tells us the future is already here, that it is catastrophic, and that we can do nothing to change it. A media studies of preparedness seeks to make change possible by resuscitating the futures security media produce, allowing us to reimagine the different forms preparedness might take. This dissertation examines the media of preparedness. Preparedness, a national security paradigm that moved to the center of US policy after September 11, 2001, simulates future catastrophes to plan for their eventual emergence. I analyze a wide variety of governmental media from the US Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, and from intergovernmental organizations like the World Health Organization and the International Panel on Climate Change -- including policy documents, training scenarios, databases, automated surveillance systems, and modeling platforms -- as well as contemporary American science fiction films and novels. In my analysis, these different media all function as kinds of speculative fiction, producing the catastrophic futures with which preparedness is concerned in the present. I argue they train their various audiences -- government officials, experts, the ""general public"" -- to accept catastrophe as part of everyday life and to expect its perpetual re-emergence indefinitely into the future.",,,
484,Corporate Environmentalism: Exploring the Validity of Voluntary Environmental Reform,"This research dissects the environmental sustainability claims made by ten large, publicly traded multinational corporations. The goal of this project is to 1) study well known businesses to uncover best (and worst) practices for pursuing environmental sustainability, 2) explore the ways in which voluntary environmental reform can compliment existing regulation and future government intervention, and 3) to equip consumers with the skills to differentiate between corporate greenwashing and legitimate attempts to practice environmentally responsible business. The study utilizes comparative analyses of 3M, Alcoa, Bayer, Duke Energy, Darden Restaurants, ExxonMobil, Kraft Foods, Kimberly Clark, Monsanto, and Nestle, in order to make statements about the relative strengths and weaknesses of various methods for achieving voluntary corporate environmental reform. In doing so, this project works to highlight some of the emergent themes within corporate environmental sustainability while underscoring the need for further reform. Over all, the project illustrates that while some commitments to environmental sustainability may be valid, they will not, on their own, be enough to address serious global environmental concerns.",,,
485,"Reforming, Deforming, and Performing: Remixing Digital and Traditional Approaches to Jose Agustin's La tumba","Lastly, this dissertation connects the fields of Digital Humanities and Hispanic literature. Recent trends in literary criticism, which were previously labeled as ""non-normative"" methods of study, are now considered acceptable. These methods include different types of computer-assisted or machine readings as well as textual visualizations. However, there is a lack of representation of using these digital tools in the field of Hispanic literature; this dissertation responds directly to this void. Reforming Deforming, and Performing: Remixing Digital and Traditional Approaches to Jose Agustin's La tumba by Claire Elizabeth Ihlendorf Burke This dissertation focuses on the novel La tumba, by Mexican author, Jose Agustin and explores this 1960s text through a digital lens. La tumba, written by Agustin when he was just seventeen, follows the life of a young, urban, upper-class protagonist who is disillusioned with his life and society in Mexico City in the beginning of the 1960s. What my re-reading of La tumba aspires to contribute to the existing critical landscape is summarized by three goals. The framework for my textual experimentation comes from the concept of deformance by Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuels. For the purposes of my investigations, I extend this concept from poetry (as McGann and Samuels outline) to an entire novel. I combine my analysis of the deformances with traditional textual analysis/close reading scholarship. I also explore performances of the novel through social media platforms in order to consider the text in a modern-day format. This structure supports the secondary goal of my work, which is to propose new methodology that can be applicable in the study of other novels, regardless of language. The tools and methods I use can be adopted for literary analysis, but also have utility in a teaching capacity. Secondly, my work acts as a model for the study of other texts. Agustin has never been examined with a computer-assisted close reading and my dissertation acts as an example of what can be done for future study of other texts and further investigations of Agustin's work. I explore case studies in which I used both deformances and performances of the text in a classroom setting to gauge the pedagogical implications of these methods. My research demonstrates the new perspectives and insights gained by using digital tools and visualizations, and while doing so, I demonstrate how these methodologies can be employed in the study of other texts. Firstly, my reading demonstrates a new degree of investigation, examining previously undiscovered perspectives of this classic text. I base my analysis of a re-mapping of the text by combining new and traditional hermeneutics. Where previous scholars have limited their scope purely on linguistic elements of this text, I offer new outlets for analysis that extend beyond the existing readings. Through this work I explore the relationships in the text, specifically those between the female characters and the protagonist.",,,
486,Three Essays on the Economics of Groundwater Management Institutions,"The first chapter explores how properties of an aquifer influence the incentives of groundwater irrigators to engage in collective management. Using data from Kansas, counties with high hydraulic conductivity, a measure of how ""common"" the groundwater resource is, are shown to benefit more from management, among other results. The chapter demonstrates the benefit of directing management based on physical properties of a resource. Institutions can emerge and evolve to solve environmental and natural resource problems. However, these resources are often characterized by scientific complexity, a lack of complete property rights, and dispersed benefits. Aligning private and social benefits and costs can increase total social welfare, but also requires increased control over the resource, which is costly. Increased control comes through strengthening property rights, which may be held by the state, by local user groups, individuals, or a combination. This dissertation explores how knowledge of the physical properties of a resource, and in particular groundwater, is critical to understanding the incentives to engage in bargaining over property rights, lobbying, or other management program. The third chapter presents interdisciplinary work that explores how outflows benefitting ecosystems may warrant maintaining groundwater tables at higher levels than private economic incentives would indicate. A case in northern Chile is examined. Here, a wetland and lacustrine environment and a village dependent on that environment disappeared due to water extraction for use in mining. The paper explores how economics and hydrology illustrate the inherent tradeoffs in this type of development. The second chapter explores how the separation of ground and surface water rights can create differences in preferences over policy alternatives, expressed through political channels. Economic efficiency may not be the key determinant of outcomes as affected parties interact with politicians and administrative agencies. An economic model is introduced to explore the political choice of the environmental good, instruments to be used (quantity restrictions, subsidies or taxes), or how costs will be distributed. A case analysis of water-trading/access restrictions on copper mining firms in northern Chile's Antofagasta Region illustrates the key points of a theoretical framework.",,,
487,Decision-Making under Spatial Uncertainty in Downscaled Population Estimates: An Assessment of HIV Prevalence in Tanzania,"Our findings show that for effective decision analysis, rather than using coarse aggregated values such as census data at the district level, decision-makers may benefit from the application of multiple simulated spatial distributions of fine scale population along with the associated ARV cost estimates. From this distribution of ARV cost estimates, decision-makers could select best estimates based on an explication of risk attitude, thus avoiding unforeseeable consequences of underestimating or overestimating impact assessment outcomes of HIV prevalence. Spatially explicit impact assessment analyses such as vulnerability studies often require spatially detailed population distribution as input. Downscaled population datasets otherwise known as disaggregated, gridded or fine resolution population datasets are becoming increasingly available at global and regional scales and are based on information from various sources with varying spatial and temporal resolutions as well as reliabilities. Uncertainty is endemic in such downscaled population estimates, particularly in developing countries yet it is hardly assessed. Consequently, decision-makers are potentially faced with a bias problem whereby uncertainties are masked and estimates are presented as unique or expected values even after being derived in a probabilistic context. This research explores how HIV prevalence in three districts of the United Republic of Tanzania might vary with the utilization of simulations of downscaled population estimates. In so doing, this study explores some scenarios in which HIV prevalence that corresponds to minimum expected cost of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment is estimated under three different decision-making attitudes, namely minimax regret, maximin and maximax, followed by a discussion of some implications of any variation in best estimates of HIV prevalence corresponding to the least impact on ARV cost.",,,
488,The Pachamama Worldview in the Ecuadorian Urban Ayllu Network: Mashi Identity and Resistance in Early 21st-century Quito,"Shifts in national political and cultural identity were fueled by popular projects of interculturalism whereby linguistic, ethnic, and ideological differences were encouraged and openly observed. As of 2007, the Ecuadorian constitution officially acknowledges the concept of mother earth as a living being. It also recognizes Pachamama worldview concepts such as sumak kawsay, or well-being, as underpinnings of a sustaining way of life. Better chances at self-determination and communal development became available during these social shifts in Ecuador. As migration to Quito and other large cities continued in this century, ayllu networks grew dramatically in predominantly mashi districts like San Roque, just south of Old Town Quito. Political mobilization by Ecuadorian mashikuna or indigenous pueblos and nations culminated nationwide in the 1990 uprising whereby the Ecuadorian president was overthrown. This political maneuver was orchestrated by coalitions of different sectors of Ecuadorian society. Mashikuna national networks mobilized effectively to block transportation and commerce, backed by mestizo elite and working sectors, and military leadership, with the help of rank and file. Rising national discontent with neoliberal policy implementation in the late 1980's fueled alliances against corrupted political leadership. To understand the everyday practice of Pachamama worldview is essential to understand Ecuadorian indigenous identity and political mobilization in the 21st century. Sumak kawsay provides political, spiritual and economic support for ayllus that are have no government support. The importance of sumak kawsay in the life of mashikuna explains their unwavering resistance against neoliberal projects of individualism and the destruction of the environment for profit. Despite migration to urban centers, outside cultural and technological influence, religious shifts, and continuing racism, mashi continue to live in solidarity with one another, according to the Pachamama worldview. The San Roque network in Quito is an example of how Ecuadorian urban ayllu networks acculturate while maintaining a core identity that entails complex political and economic ties. San Roque provides mashi ayllu networks a degree of autonomy to develop influential political, economic, and spiritual coalitions according to their sumak kawsay. An autonomous space to practice it has always been available to mashikuna for it is essential to their continuance and identity. However, in the 21st century ayllu the practice of sumak kawsay, mashi identity, and their resistance against inequality takes place within an empowered position unparalleled in recent history.",,,
489,"The Effects of Elevated Ocean Acidity and Temperature on the Physiological Integrity of the Larvae of the Cauliflower Coral, Pocillopora damicornis","Ocean acidification (OA) and rising sea surface temperatures will likely shape the structure and function of coral reefs in the future (Fig. 1). Understanding the sensitivity of corals to ongoing shifts in pCO2 and temperature is imperative as coral are the engineers of the coral reef ecosystem. Specifically, coral larvae may be a life history stage of corals that is particularly vulnerable to environmental stress. Shifts in physiological processes in response to environmental conditions may affect the success of larval dispersal and recruitment. To understand the consequences of OA and warming on the physiology of P. damicornis larvae, I employed a holistic approach, examining the response of a suite of physiological processes from the levels of gene expression up to the level of the whole organism. I used metabolic rate and lipid utilization as whole-organism techniques for assessing the effects of OA and warming on larval energy consumption. Planulae released after the peak of spawning experienced metabolic suppression under high-temperature, high-pCO2 conditions. There was evidence of biochemical limits of increasing oxidative capacity to satisfy elevated energy demands under future ocean conditions. Measurements of lipid utilization suggested that the metabolic costs of tolerating OA and warming will be greatest when both environmental stressors occur simultaneously. Larvae released at the peak of spawning will experience greatest changes in lipid content in response to OA and warming, with associated changes in buoyancy that affect their dispersal potential. The organism-level studies revealed physiological plasticity within coral larval energy consumption. Biochemical and transcriptomic techniques were used to better understand the underlying mechanisms. P. damicornis larvae increased their total antioxidant potential in response to oxidative stress under exposures to high pCO2 but not elevated temperature. Furthermore, OA-induced hypercapnia caused increased acid-base regulation, observed through elevated pNPPase activity of Na+/K +-ATPase. As was observed at the whole-organism level, physiological traits varied between cohorts of larvae. Finally, comparisons of gene expression profiles revealed down-regulation of genes under single-stressor treatments but up-regulation of genes when high-pCO2 and high-temperature co-occurred. An important facet of my dissertation research was to provide environmental context for the results of my biological experiments. I deployed autonomous pH and temperature sensors on the fringing reefs where the experimental corals were collected. The time series of pH and temperature approximated the conditions of the water mass bathing the reef to which the study organisms were acclimatized and into which the larvae would have been released. These environmental data confirmed that control treatments in the laboratory experiments were within the range of conditions experienced on the reef. The elevated pCO2 treatment levels were not observed in the present-day time series. Additionally, pH and temperature regimes differed between reefs in Moorea and Taiwan. pH and temperature were on average lower in Taiwan and more variable in Moorea. Temperature was on average lower and more variable in Taiwan. These results highlight the importance of generating such an environmental context for study species. Environmental data informed metrics of biological performance of individuals at these sites as well as the potential heterogeneity of phenotypes across the biogeographic species range, products of local adaptation to regimes of pH and temperature. The aim of this dissertation was to examine the physiological plasticity of coral larvae in response to two potentially interacting anthropogenic stressors -- OA and warming. Pocillopora damicornis (Linnaeus, 1758) was an excellent study organism for this research given its ubiquitous Indo-Pacific distribution, reef-building role, and long dispersal potential. To accomplish the objectives of this dissertation, I conducted laboratory experiments in which P. damicornis larvae were exposed to seawater of different pCO2 and temperature conditions. P. damicornis larvae were collected from populations in Moorea, French Polynesia and southern Taiwan.",,,
490,Essays on Social Influences in Economic Decision Making,"Understanding social influences is vitally important to understanding human behavior; unfortunately, observing and measuring these effects is extremely difficult. This dissertation focuses on applying and developing techniques to measure social influences on individual decision making. The first chapter develops two techniques for estimating social influences using friendship networks, even when individuals differ on unobservable attributes. The second chapter uses social networks sampled from villages in India to demonstrate strong peer influences on an individual's decision to take a microfinance loan. The final chapter examines changes in juvenile criminal behavior in response to their schools changing to a four-day school week. An abstract for each chapter is provided below. Chapter 2 Abstract: I use friendship networks from villages in rural India to provide a careful examination of peer effects in decisions to take up microfinance. Using social networks resolves the traditional identification problems associated with peer effect estimation and allows each individual to have their own peer group. Since the networks in question are sampled and some friendship information is missing, I use an analytic correction to ensure unbiased estimates as well as a technique known as graphical reconstruction to provide bounds on estimators accounting for possible configurations of the unobserved links in the data. In addition to including a variety of individual covariates, I control for observable characteristics of an individual's peers, examine different ways of specifying network links, and account for the probability of being informed about the program. Across these specifications I find positive and significant peer effects; an additional friend participating in microfinance increases the probability that an individual participates in microfinance by 6%-10%. Chapter 3 Abstract: There has been a recent trend to implement four-day school weeks, especially in rural areas. We show that changing to a four-day school week influences youth criminal activity in jurisdictions where these policies take effect, especially impacting property crime. Focusing on Colorado, where four-day school weeks are especially prevalent, we show that switching all students in a county to a four-day week leads to 0.75 additional juvenile arrests for larceny per 1,000 residents. Effects on other types of crime are inconclusive; estimated signs on drug and violent crimes are negative, although neither attains statistical significance. Chapter 1 Abstract: Existing methods for identifying peer effects in social networks require the assumption that there are no unobserved factors that determine both network links and the outcome of interest. Since this assumption is likely to be violated in most networks, I provide two distinct methods for estimating peer effects in the presence of individual heterogeneity. First, I show that if repeated observations on individuals are available, accounting for time-invariant individual attributes can restore identification. Second, I suggest a semi-parametric Bayesian instrumental variables technique that can be used to estimate peer effects models when panel data is not available or if fixed effects assumptions are undesirable. I demonstrate the properties of both strategies using simulated network data and provide evidence that both are able to estimate peer effects, even when networks exhibit sorting on observable and unobservable attributes. Additionally, I apply both techniques to estimate peer effects in the United States Congress using cosponsorship networks and voting outcomes.",,,
491,Help-Seeking in English-Speaking Orthodox Jewish-Israelis: A Qualitative Study,"This study explores the help-seeking process of English-speaking Orthodox Jews living in Jerusalem, Israel. There is a belief, backed by some research coming out of public mental health facilities in Jerusalem, that the religious community underutilizes traditional mental health resources (Rosen, Greenberg, Schmeidler & Shefler, 2008). The conclusion of the research proposes that the underutilization is likely due to stigma within the community. This study addresses the question: What is the process that Orthodox Jewish English-speaking immigrants in the Jerusalem community use to seek help in times of emotional stress? The study addresses both barriers and facilitators to resources for this community. A qualitative, constructivist grounded theory approach was used in the collection and analysis of 26 interviews. Standards of trustworthiness as outlined by Morrow (2005) were used to ensure the rigor of the study. The result is an attachment theory-informed, nine-stage cyclical model of help-seeking as well as in-depth descriptive information about individuals' unique and culturally specific experience of the nine stages. Factors such as individuals' help-seeking filters, structural barriers (mainly transportation and cost) as well as community emphasis on privacy and therapist value-match are some of the barriers identified by participants as important in their help-seeking processes; these findings indicate a more complex explanation and understanding of why this population may not use government-funded resources. These findings also have important implications for theory, research, practice and education.",,,
492,"Infectious Imperialism: Race, Syphilis, and Human Experimentation in Guatemala City, 1946-1948","In 1945, the U.S National Institute of Health (NIH) issued the official Research Grant (RG-65) to the Pan American Health Organization reading ""The Guatemala study dealing with the experimental transmission of syphilis to human volunteers and improved methods of prophylaxis"". During the two-year experiment---U.S Public Health Service doctors traveled to foreign lands and intentionally infected Guatemalan prisoners, soldiers, and mental patients with syphilis and other forms of STD. These subjects are central to the discussion of the present thesis as we explore how they were created, what local institutions managed this population, and ways ideas of health and citizenship fit into the global context of science. In addition, the Guatemalan syphilis experiments beg us to revisit historical power relations throughout the Americas and avenues scientists' appropriate, shape, and (re)produce developing regions by means of racial generalizations surrounding Latin American institutions and susceptibility to disease. This region retains a strong connection to centuries of colonial dominance from imperial powers seeking to control land and labor resources.

493,Awareness of Observation Affects Resting State Brain Activity,"Functional imaging studies have revealed the default mode network (DMN) activates when people are at rest. However, generally only minimal instructions were provided among those studies. Our goal in this study was to demonstrate how resting state activity varies with the knowledge of being watched. In this study, we used two distinct manipulations to address this question: first, we described two separate scans as being either anatomical or functional (with little additional detail), when in fact both were functional; and second, in a putatively separate experiment, we informed participants we were able to observe their thoughts, and after a more thorough description, carried out three more functional scans, one of which was again described as anatomical. Our results demonstrate there are systematic differences across several networks as a function of instructional differences. Most strikingly, there was a significant increase in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) when comparing the first functional scan to the first sham anatomical scan, and a substantial increase in functional connectivity within the DMN when comparing the second sham anatomical scan to the second and third functional scans. These results suggest the mere awareness that one is being watched causes significant changes in the patterns of activity across functional networks, including the DMN. They also suggest the importance of using precise instructions in resting-state studies, because even slight variations in instruction can have substantial impacts on the brain's activity at rest.",,,
495,"Competing Knowledges, Uncertain Futures: A Study of Mediated Technoscience Publics in India","This project investigates media's role in technoscience controversies by focusing on four case studies from India: issues of chronic toxicity in the continuing aftermath of the Bhopal gas disaster; disputes over regulating emission of potentially carcinogenic electromagnetic radiation by mobile towers; battles over building atomic power plants between nuclear nationalists on one hand and anti-nuclear pacifists and affected local communities on the other; public deliberations leading to a moratorium on genetically modified eggplants. I do not suggest that each technology determines its own particular discourse. Rather, I focus on how science as culture interacts with media discourses and cultural values: newsworthiness, nationalism, security, framing, globalization, and democracy. The debates I explore are not restricted to ""objective"" scientific processes, but are instead marked by incommensurable values, competing expertise, and radical uncertainties. These controversies spiral out in the public domain, where the expressive and persuasive characteristics of media prove crucial. A technoscience public consisting of--scientists, activists, policy-makers, and affected patients--that gathers around a disruptive technology, such as a nuclear reactor or cell tower antennae, cannot be materialized or imagined without the circulation of discourses through the process of mediation. Thus, technoscience publics and media publics intersect and reconfigure each other, and in each chapter, I trace the different unfolding debates by tracking the dynamic reconfigurations of the ""mediated technoscience publics."" Through an elaboration of the concept ""mediated technoscience publics"" my dissertation provides both a theoretical vocabulary and a methodological approach to study media and technoscience/environmental debates together. I emerge with notions of media that at once retain the specificity of a particular media format like a talk show or a media object like a cell phone, and yet are not tied to any one of them. I conceptualize media landscapes as circulatory systems of signs and signals, discourses and matter, representations and resonances. My approach emphasizes close examination of media practices (Ursula Rao, Brian Larkin) and performative mediation (Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska) to theorize the materiality of scientific knowledge production and publics (Karen Barad, Alexander Kluge, Jane Bennett).",,,
496,Training Paraprofessionals to Improve Social Skills in Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders,"The number of students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) requiring special education services in public schools have steadily increased over the last decade (Scull & Winkler, 2011; U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2013). In response, the employment of paraprofessionals in schools has increased in order to support these students (Blalock, 1991; Boomer, 1994; Frith & Lindsey, 1982; National Center for Education Statistics, 2007; Pickett, 1986). Although paraprofessionals often bear the responsibility to provide both academic and social support to students with ASD, they receive little to no training on how to successfully support these students (Giangreco, Edelman, Broer, & Doyle, 2001; Jones & Bender, 1993). The results are discussed in terms of their implications for using trained paraprofessionals to improve social skills for students with ASD in the school setting. Specifically, paraprofessionals were trained to stand in an appropriate proximity from the target student while providing cooperative arrangements and incorporating the preferred/specialized interests of students with ASD with typically developing peers into common playground games/activities. This present study also assessed whether training paraprofessionals in these three components would improve the social interactions between students with ASD and typically developing peers (i.e., social engagement and rate of verbal initiations). The results of this present study suggest that paraprofessionals can be trained to fidelity to implement social intervention for students with ASD. The results also suggest that when paraprofessionals are trained to implement social intervention for students with ASD, the level of engagement and rate of verbal initiations improves for these students. Providing social support to students with ASD becomes especially important when considering the risk factors associated with not receiving appropriate social intervention such as having fewer lasting peer relationships and spending less time in peer interactions compared to typically developing peers (Bauminger, & Shulman, 2003; Kasari, Rotheram-Fuller, Locke, & Gulsrud, 2012). A recent study by Koegel, Kim, and Koegel (2014) provide optimism that paraprofessionals can be trained to fidelity to implement an effective social intervention for students with ASD. Within the context of a multiple baseline across participants design, the present study assessed whether paraprofessionals could be trained to effectively implement social interventions for students with ASD.",,,
497,Advanced Automated Web Application Vulnerability Analysis,"Web applications are an integral part of our lives and culture. We use web applications to manage our bank accounts, interact with friends, and file our taxes. A single vulnerability in one of these web applications could allow a malicious hacker to steal your money, to impersonate you on Facebook, or to access sensitive information, such as tax returns. It is vital that we develop new approaches to discover and fix these vulnerabilities before the cybercriminals exploit them. In this dissertation, I will present my research on securing the web against current threats and future threats. First, I will discuss my work on improving black-box vulnerability scanners, which are tools that can automatically discover vulnerabilities in web applications. Then, I will describe a new type of web application vulnerability: Execution After Redirect, or EAR, and an approach to automatically detect EARs in web applications. Finally, I will present deDacota, a first step in the direction of making web applications secure by construction.",,,
498,Modeling the evolution of gene regulatory network complexity and its relation to the dynamics of p53 pathway,"Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) has highlighted the importance of gene regulation and these regulatory interactions form a complex network that can evolve over time. The evolution of GRNs can be explained in multiple perspectives. First, the structural change such as gene duplication and gene loss can change the topology of GRNs. Second, the comparison of the same GRNs in different species may explain the evolution of GRNs. Here, we consider how network topology affects the evolution of network states in response to fluctuations in the environment and whether topology itself is expected to evolve in a consistent way. Then, we examine a specific model, p53 pathway. p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer and it's has been studied well. From the evolutionary perspective, we decomposed the p53 pathway to several configurations which are derived from the phylogenetic tree of the p53 pathway. We prove the function of each feedback loop and show how the p53 pathway evolves. Lastly, we look narrowly into C. elegans p53 pathway, CEP -- 1 pathway. C. elegans has been studied as an useful genetic model for cellar response. We compare the structural and functional difference of p53 in C. elegans and mammalian.",,,
499,From Positive Emotions to Health Outcomes : Understanding Mechanisms,"Although positive emotions have been relatively understudied (in comparison to negative emotions), the existing research suggests that positive emotions can have a beneficial effect on health outcomes and health-relevant biomarkers. It is likely that positive emotions benefit health through buffering individuals from the effects of stress; however, more research is needed to uncover the psychosocial processes through which positive emotions exert this stress-buffering effect. Two studies tested the hypothesis that positive emotions can impact coping, rumination, and perceptions of resources, three processes with important implications for health and well-being. In Study 1, participants were assigned to watch film clips designed to induce the emotions of love or amusement (or to watch a neutral film clip), after which they completed measures of coping and rumination (including an implicit measure of coping). In Study 2, participants were assigned to write about experiences of gratitude (or neutral topics), after which they completed measures of coping, social resources, and personal resources. The present studies failed to find support for the hypothesis that positive emotions impact coping, rumination, and perceived resources. The findings and directions for future research are discussed.",,,
501,Extreme Businessmen: Representations of Contemporary Corporate Life,"This dissertation advances an emerging critical interest in contemporary financial culture by both identifying a new genre, financial culture literature, and by theorizing its depictions of ""80s businessmen"" as iconic of late capitalism. I describe this genre's development in canonical and non-canonical works from the last three decades through sociological theories of risk (especially financial risk), and a history of Western economic practice. My dissertation first establishes financial culture literature's genealogy in modernist novels like Theodore Dreiser's The Financier (1912) and later in post-war novels like Richard Yates's Revolutionary Road (1961), texts that depict how business culture absorbs white-collar workers figures into paradoxically alienated, yet extreme social lives of starched-collar efficiency. Against this backdrop, I explain how the trade of new, massively lucrative credit ""products"" (derivatives, securities, junk bonds) made possible by Reaganomics' deregulation of banking practices created a new, bizarre class of risk-loving, fast-buck financiers, extreme in their disconnection from social responsibility and socioeconomic realities. Financial culture literature both critiques and glamorizes these figures; novels and films that represent the 80s businessman's glamorous world of penthouses and tinted windows with the extreme, shocking, or macabre, in order to unmask the businessman's heroic gambler's bravado as a form of corporatized violence and hedonism. Consequently, my dissertation reveals how fictional characters such as the film Wall Street's Gordon Gekko (1987) and American Psycho's Patrick Bateman (1991) are paradigmatic of an emerging literary tradition critical of (and fascinated by) the unsustainable life of new corporate worlds.",,,
503,Exotic Phenomena in Quantum Pyrochlore Materials,"Theorists have envisioned a great variety of exotic states of quantum matter, including topological phases, states with emergent gauge structure, and non-Fermi liquid quantum critical states. But the realization of such states in reality lags far behind, and it is not always clear where to look. In this dissertation I discuss some efforts to find exotica in rocks : a class of minerals known as pyrochlores. In particular, I focus on three problems: order-by-disorder, quantum spin liquids and quantum criticality in fermionic systems. All were formulated theoretically in the 1970s, but their experimental realization has remained elusive, or their theoretical understanding incomplete. First, this dissertation addresses Er2Ti 2O7, a material which can, remarkably, be definitively shown to be governed by quantum order-by-disorder, a phenomenon such that quantum fluctuations lead to ordering in a system which should otherwise be disordered, classically. The flurry of resulting unusual behaviors predicted in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition are exposed: a nodal non-Fermi liquid phase, a (topological) Weyl semimetal, extreme anisotropy in real space, emergent internal SO(3) symmetry etc.. Second, a large fraction of the dissertation is devoted to an example of emergent quantum electrodynamics known as Coulombic quantum spin liquid, which may occur in rare earth pyrochlores such as Yb 2Ti2O7. The theory of these systems and this spin liquid are derived and described at zero and nonzero temperature. Quantum spin liquids are insulating states of matter with ""long-range entanglement"": quantum fluctuations are huge so that the spins typically break no symmetries but yet dramatically differ from simple paramagnets. Finally, the family of pyrochlore iridates with chemical formula A2Ir2O 7 (A is a rare-earth) is also home to exotic behaviors: for example, a new strongly-coupled three-dimensional antiferromagnetic quantum critical point arises in those materials. This presents a novel interplay of Coulomb interactions and magnetic order parameter fluctuations.",,,
504,Complex Traumatic Stress in Substance Abuse Treatment,"A Ward's method hierarchical cluster analysis with k-means procedure created a typology of traumatic stress symptomatology based upon intake T-scores on seven TSI subscales for 360 women enrolled in trauma-informed SUD treatment programs. As predicted, the clusters varied in the types, severity, and clinical complexity of traumatic stress symptoms reported. Examination of cluster centroids and descriptive data suggested evidence for all three traumatic stress symptom profiles hypothesized: (a) No Traumatic Stress, (b) Simple Posttraumatic Stress, and (c) Complex/Cumulative Traumatic Stress. In addition, the final four-cluster solution revealed a Defensive Avoidant subgroup of substance abusing women characterized by elevated centroid scores on the Defensive Avoidance clinical subscale of the TSI without concurrent elevation of other symptoms of simple or complex traumatic stress. Women in all clusters reported histories of cumulative, interpersonal trauma, but the prevalence was greatest among women exhibiting complex/cumulative traumatic stress symptomatology. Program completion was similar across traumatic stress symptom clusters in both models of trauma-informed treatment. Implications for research, diagnosis, and intervention are discussed. This study calls for complex-trauma-informed assessment and treatment of co-occurring psychological trauma, traumatic stress, and SUD. Many women with substance use disorders (SUD) have experienced complex psychological trauma including childhood interpersonal victimization. Research confirms that many adults seeking treatment for SUD exhibit co-occuring symptoms of PTSD leading to the implementation of trauma-informed treatment in behavioral health and substance abuse treatment settings. This study examined whether women in trauma-informed treatment for SUD exhibited distinct symptom profiles of simple and complex traumatic stress, and how symptomatology related to women's cumulative trauma history and trauma-informed SUD treatment completion. Traumatic stress symptomatology was examined in two ways: (a) symptom profiles based on intake T-scores on simple and complex posttraumatic stress symptom domains of the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI; Briere, 1995), and (b) cumulative traumatic stress symptom complexity (e.g., Briere et al., 2008; Cloitre et al., 2009).",,,
505,Emergent States and Magnetism in Perovskite Titanate Heterostructures,"The objective of this Dissertation is to study the relationships between emergent phenomena and heterostructure design using advanced MBE growth techniques and characterization tools, with the intent of developing controllable states of matter. The impact of strain and octahedral connectivity in epitaxially mismatched heterostructures on magnetism and electrical transport is addressed, as well as proximity effects and the influence of magnetically ordered layers on neighboring low-dimensional itinerant systems. The Dissertation begins with a motivational overview of materials and associated phenomena, describing the unique emergent properties associated with thin films. This is followed by a description of the organization of the remainder of the text. The methods implemented, including MBE and electrical transport characterization, are then discussed. Structure-magnetism and structure-transport correlations are demonstrated, as well as tunable emergent ferromagnetism in GdTiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures and quantum critical behavior in SmTiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures. Recent progress on devices based on GdTiO3/SrTiO3 are discussed. The dissertation closes with a brief summary and discussion of future works. Complex oxides show a wide array of phenomena, including magnetic states, ferroelectricity, and superconductivity. Furthermore, the advent of atomic scale engineering of the oxides using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has facilitated the discovery of novel phenomena in thin films and heterostructures not seen in bulk. Complex oxide perovskite titanate heterostructures composed of both Mott and band insulators can be fabricated readily and exhibit unique properties, including interfacial two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs), superconductivity, and magnetic ordering.",,,
506,Motivated Offense: The Role of Group Membership and Status Competition on Attributions of Offense and the Desire for Punitive Action,"Norms of political correctness dictate that people should avoid making ""offensive"" comments (particularly about marginalized groups), and that some offenders ought to be punished. While there is research on judgments of offense, it involves comparing sensitivity to criticisms delivered by ingroup versus outgroup members. Researchers have not yet addressed why individual differences in offense judgments exist, and little attention has been directed at offense judgments that are generated by political correctness concerns. What is more, there is little research on the relationship between offense and the desire to punish offenders. In an experiment testing the influence of the group membership and status of a speaker, this thesis found that women were more offended and more in favor of punishing the speaker than men, and both men and women were more offended when the comment came from a man. Additionally, individual differences that predict offense and endorsement of punishment were identified. Specifically, the more individuals valued status, the more likely they were to desire punitive action against a high status speaker. Finally, latent class analysis revealed a class of people who endorsed punitive action but were not offended, suggesting that for some, punishing political incorrectness stems from opportunity rather than offense. The findings indicate that taking offense and punishing perceived offenders is motivated by more than just objective rules of acceptable speech.",,,
507,Differential Self-Assembly of Novel Redox Crown Ethers,"Finally, the transport of K+ through nanoporous membranes and single nanopores with novel PEG-type polymeric dispersions is demonstrated. This thesis concludes with future work toward developing more advanced transporters and proposes novel uses for anthraquinone-appended polymers as proton exchange membranes and DNA-base pair interchelators. It has been demonstrated that local concentration increases of K + by direct injection proximal to the nerve can elicit nerve firing at a concentration of 15-20 mM (3-4X normal concentration) increase in K + concentration. As part of a larger concept of integrating biotechnology with nanofabrication, the materials for the development of potassium selective sequestration/storage and delivery were developed in the form of a redox-gated K+ selective crown ether. Ionic stimulation is one of the principle mechanisms that sensory neurons utilize in the generation of an action potential. In a complex transduction pathway, ionic gradients are constantly altered inside the neuron by voltage sensors or mechanically controlled gates embedded in the neuronal cell membrane; responsible for the open and close state of these ion channels. Retinal prosthesis relies on the stimulation of living nerve tissue behind the rods and cones of the eye. The current state of the art relies on electrodes controlled by cameras which directly stimulate the nerve tissue to elicit a response to an image. These types of retinal implants have allowed for short-term crude vision in patients but have had limited long term success due to external battery packs and electroplating of the implanted electrodes. The structure of the anthraquinone-based crown was deduced by computational simulation and stoichiometry of the complex confirmed by mass spec. along with 2D diffusion NMR techniques. In this instance, the stoichiometry could be controlled by the addition of different salts to give a 1:1 complex with large, aromatic anions and a 2:1 complex with smaller anions such as triflate. The synthesis of the molecule was optimized by computational modeling and simulations of transport through an artificial membrane. The selectivity of the architecture developed was specific for K+ over Na+, the other major ionic species present in the blood. The mechanism influencing the self-assembly of this class of compounds has much to do with the breakage of intramolecular pi-stacking interactions and the formation of stronger intermolecular pi-stacking interactions.",,,
508,High Speed Integrated Circuits for High Speed Coherent Optical Communications,"The thesis also describes heterodyne OPLLs. These can be used to synthesize optical wavelengths of a broad bandwidth (optical wavelength synthesis) with narrow linewidth and with fast frequency switching. There are many applications of such narrow linewidth optical signal sources, including low phase noise mm-wave and THz-signal sources, wavelength-division-multiplexed optical transmitters, and coherent imaging and sensor systems. The heterodyne OPLL also has the same stability issues (loop delay and sensitivity) as the homodyne OPLL. In the EIC, a single sideband mixer operating using digital design principles (DSSBM) enables precisely controlled sweeping of the frequency of the locked laser, with control of the sign of the frequency offset. The loop's phase and frequency difference detector (PFD) uses digital design techniques to make the OPLL loop parameters only weakly sensitive to optical signal levels or optical or electrical component gains. The heterodyne OPLL operates stably with a loop bandwidth of 550 MHz and loop delay of <200 ps. An initial OPLL design exhibited optical frequency (wavelength) synthesis from -6 GHz to -2 GHz and from 2 GHz to 9 GHz. An improved OPLL reached frequency tuning up to 25 GHz. The homodyne OPLL exhibits -110 dBc/Hz phase noise at 10 MHz offset and -80 dBc/Hz at 5 kHz offset. This dissertation will discuss three different approaches for optical components and communication systems using high speed ICs: a homodyne optical phase locked loop (OPLL), a heterodyne OPLL, and a new WDM receiver architecture. The homodyne OPLL receiver is designed for short-link optical communication systems using coherent modulation for high spectral efficiency. The phase-locked coherent receiver can recover the transmitted data without requiring complex back-end digital signal processing to recover the phase of the received optical carrier. The main components of the homodyne OPLL are a photonic IC (PIC), an electrical IC (EIC), and a loop filter. One major challenge in OPLL development is loop bandwidth; this must be of order 1 GHz in order for the loop to adequately track and suppress the phase fluctuations of the locked laser, yet a 1 GHz loop bandwidth demands small (<100 ps) propagation delays if the loop is to be stable. Monolithic integration of the high-speed loop components into one electrical and one photonic IC decreases the total loop delay. We have designed and demonstrated an OPLL with a compact size of 10 x 10 mm2, stably operating with a loop bandwidth of 1.1 GHz, a loop delay of 120 ps, a pull-in time of 0.55 mus and lock time of <10 ns. The coherent receiver can receive 40 Gb/s BPSK data with a bit error rate (BER) of <10-7, and operates up to 35 Gb/s with BER 10-12. Finally, the thesis describes a new WDM receiver architecture using broadband electrical ICs. In the proposed WDM receiver, a set of received signals at different optical wavelengths are mixed against a single optical local oscillator. This mixing converts the WDM channels to electrical signals in the receiver photocurrent, with each WDM signal being converted to an RF sub-carrier of different frequency. An electrical IC then separately converts each sub-carrier signal to baseband using single-sideband mixers and quadrature local oscillators. The proposed receiver needs less complex hardware than the arrays of wavelength-sensitive receivers now used for WDM, and can readily adjust to changes in the WDM channel frequencies. The proposed WDM receiver concept was demonstrated through several system experiments. Image rejection of greater than 25 dB, adjacent channel suppression of greater than 20 dB, operation with gridless channels, and six-channel data reception at a total 15 Gb/s (2.5 Gb/s BPSK x 6-channels) were demonstrated. With the development of (sub) THz transistor technologies, high speed integrated circuits up to sub-THz frequencies are now feasible. These high speed and wide bandwidth ICs can improve the performance of optical components, coherent optical fiber communication, and imaging systems. In current optical systems, electrical ICs are used primarily as driving amplifiers for optical modulators, and in receiver chains including TIAs, AGCs, LPFs, ADCs and DSPs. However, there are numerous potential applications in optics using high speed ICs, and different approaches may be required for more efficient, compact and flexible optical systems.",,,
509,Nanomaterials' Influences on the Emergence of Life and Their Toxic Effects on Bacteria and Protozoa,"To understand biological weathering of NMs, the use of STEM energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was enhanced to analyze single nano-sized particles. Contamination studies using cadmium selenide (CdSe) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) NMs with PA showed that CdSe weathering occurred in the cytoplasm while CdTe weathering predominantly occurred when associated with the PA cell wall. PA was shown to produce CdSe NMs in the cytoplasm when grown with cadmium and selenite salts as revealed by STEM-EDS. The use of STEM-EDS on embedded samples makes it possible to analyze NM structures while in their experimental location. Nano-titanium dioxide NMs (nTiO2) were used to show the toxicity of nTiO2 encrusted Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) fed to Tetrahymena thermophila (TT) protozoa under aerobic conditions. The control TT showed limited toxicity when grown in the presence of nTiO2, and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed the initial accumulation of nTiO2 in food vacuoles (FVs) of control TT cells that were not observed in the TT grown with nTiO2-encrusted PA. After 22 h, very little nTiO2 is observed in the control TT FVs as compared with the TT grown with nTiO2-encrusted PA FVs which had about 30% of the FV filled with nTiO2. Toxicity to nTiO2 was observed as reduced growth yields for both the control and the PA fed TT, but also as a reduction in growth rate for TT grown with nTiO2-encrusted PA. This research investigates the unique properties of nanomaterials (NMs) with highly catalytic surfaces that make them ideal for the production of organic molecules but also confer toxic properties of some NMs. Iron-sulphide NMs were used in a hydrothermal reactor that released hydrogen sulphide and other metal ions in the effluent, as analyzed by inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry. Using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM), iron sulphide NM surfaces indicate severe weathering as a result of environmental conditions including high pressure (100 bar H2) and moderate temperatures (130C). The effluent's chemical properties from the reactor experiment generated chimney structures from newly formed iron-sulphide NMs in a ferrous rich 'Hadean Ocean' solution. Using ESEM, we show that structural changes occur under different pHs, temperatures, and silicate concentrations. The presence of 5-mer peptides also shows distinct structural differences during the formation of iron-sulphide NM chimneys.",,,
510,Assessing Inequality using Geographic Income Distributions,"This dissertation has three main chapters. The common aim of each chapter is to incorporate geographic information into a metric's formulation in order to make it more relevant to an explicit concern. Each of the chapters of the dissertation share three objectives: develop a spatial view of inequality based on a concern; incorporate the spatial view into a metric's formulation using a spatial weights matrix; evaluate if the results based on spatial assessments diverge from aspatial ones. An important empirical finding of this research is that a proposed intra-city, inter-race inequality metric registers acute differentials among latino and white neighborhoods that an additive decomposition metric does not register. A key conceptual finding is the paradox that spatial inequality metrics formulated for different concerns can register the same change in opposite directions. Ordinarily, an analysis of income differentials based on standard metrics, such as the variance statistic or the gini coefficient, implicitly weights income differentials among different places the same, regardless of whether some pairs of places are more economically interdependent than others. The problem with the assumption that all pairs of places are uniformly interdependent is that changes in those income differentials considered to be less relevant to the inequality concern being addressed may quantitatively obscure acute changes of more relevant differentials.",,,
511,Student Perceptions of Multicultural Awareness Development Through Participation in a Multicultural Living-Learning Community,"The purpose of this study was to better understand how students perceive participation in a multicultural living-learning community to be an influence on their development of multicultural awareness. This question was explored by examining the following research questions, why do students select to live on the Multicultural Hall, what experiences do students identify as valuable to the development of their multicultural awareness, how does participating in the Multicultural Hall foster relationships among students from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and how do students describe the influence of these relationships on the development of their multicultural awareness. Fourteen students who lived on the Multicultural Hall in 2012-2013 were interviewed using an in-depth, semi-structured interview model. Interviews transcripts were examined using a Consensual Qualitative Research approach. Archival documents prepared by the Multicultural Hall Resident Assistants were also reviewed. Intergroup contact theory was used to evaluate and analyze participant responses and information contained in the archival documents. Results of the study revealed that students who actively participated believed that participating in the Multicultural Hall contributed to their development of multicultural awareness. Student participants identified that living in a community of diverse others that was inclusive, and supportive of cross-cultural learning and understanding were important factors in their multicultural awareness development. Additionally, the value of developing friendships with diverse others was noted by students as important in developing multicultural awareness.",,,
513,Investigation of the Seismic Nucleation Phase of Large Earthquakes Using Broadband Teleseismic Data,"Potential applications of this work could attempt to predict the magnitude of an earthquake seconds before it begins by measuring the SNP, vastly improving earthquake Early Warning Systems for populated areas. Our study also reveals that the percentage of the SNP events is correlated with the focal mechanism and hypocenter depths. Strike-slip earthquakes are more likely to exhibit a clear SNP than normal or thrust earthquakes. Eleven of 14 strike-slip earthquakes (78.6%) have detectable NSPs. In contrast, only 16 of 40 (40%) thrust earthquakes have detectable SNPs. This percentage also became smaller for deep events (33% for events with hypocenter depth>250 km). To understand why certain thrust earthquakes have a visible SNP, we examined the sediment thickness, age, and angle of the subducting plate of all thrust earthquakes in the study. We found that thrust events with shallow (600 m) on the subducting plate tend to have clear SNPs. If the SNP can be better understood in the future, it may help seismologists better understand the rupture dynamics of large earthquakes. The dynamic motion of an earthquake begins abruptly, but is often initiated by a short interval of weak motion called the seismic nucleation phase (SNP). Ellsworth and Beroza [1995, 1996] concluded that the SNP was detectable in near-source records of 48 earthquakes with moment magnitude (Mw), ranging from 1.1 to 8.1. They found that the SNP accounted for approximately 0.5% of the total moment and 1/6 of the duration of the earthquake. Ji et al [2010] investigated the SNP of 19 earthquakes with Mw greater than 8.0 using teleseismic broadband data. This study concluded that roughly half of the earthquakes had detectable SNPs, inconsistent with the findings of Ellsworth and Beroza [1995]. Here 69 earthquakes of Mw 7.5-8.0 from 1994 to 2011 are further examined. The SNP is clearly detectable using teleseismic data in 32 events, with 35 events showing no nucleation phase, and 2 events had insufficient data to perform stacking, consistent with the previous analysis.",,,
514,The Speculum of Divine Justice and Obedience in Christian and Islamic Mirrors for Princes,"Most contemporary scholarship affirms that the Christian and Islamic medieval political imperative was about the preservation of order and stability. We considered this characterization insufficient, given the treatment of the concept of religious and political justice by medieval thinkers in both traditions. In fact, Christian and Islamic political theologies stress that the rulers of their respective communities should 'mirror' divine justice. They also emphasize the need to obey the ruler for the sake of preserving order in their societies. The present study then argues that there is an inconsistency between the emphases on political obedience on the one hand, and the religious imperative of political justice on the other. As a result, Islamic and Christian thought is permeated with a certain degree of anxiety that made more than one Muslim or Christian author uncomfortable. This dissertation is a study of such anxiety. We first survey the influence of Greek and Persian philosophical heritage, centered in harmony and stability for both traditions, as found in the Eastern political concept of the ""Circle of Justice"". Second, we contrast this influence with the religious meaning of justice as religious righteousness, a theological imperative found in both traditions, and represented in Islam under the maxim of ""commanding good and forbidding evil"". To do so, we focus on Christian and Islamic Mirrors for Princes up to the 16th century, a literary genre known as part of the political and theological discourse in both traditions. The major contribution of this study is to show the commonalities in Christian and Islamic political theology, particularly in their treatment of the key religious and political values of justice and obedience.",,,
515,The Thermoelectric Properties of Rare Earths as Dopants in InGaAs Films,"Doping MBE grown InGaAs films with rare earths forms embedded nanoparticles that have been shown to improve thermoelectric efficiency of InGaAs. Rare earth doping effectively overcomes the problematic relationship between electrical and thermal conductivities. These embedded particles effectively decouple thermal and electrical properties by contributing carriers to increase electrical conductivity as well as forming scattering centers for mid to long wavelength phonons to decrease thermal conductivity. However, the mechanism for carrier generation from rare earths is poorly understood. Comparing different rare earths as dopants in InGaAs, we find a positive correlation with the electrical activation efficiency as the rare earth arsenide nanoparticles are more closely lattice matched to the host matrix. This is in contrast to traditional Si doped InGaAs, which is fully ionized at room temperature. The high doping efficiency of Si leads it to be as good or better of a dopant for thermoelectrics compared to the best rare earths studied. We observe that rare earth doped InGaAs has thermal activation of carriers at high temperature, giving it the potential to be a more efficient thermoelectric in this regime than traditionally doped InGaAs. Current energy technologies lose over half of the energy input to waste heat. Thermoelectric materials can recover some of this waste heat by converting it into electricity. Thermoelectric devices have no moving parts, so they are low noise and highly reliable, making them particularly suitable for extreme environments. A good thermoelectric has low thermal conductivity to maintain large temperature gradients and high electrical conductivity to effectively transport carriers across that temperature gradient. One of the major challenges in engineering such thermoelectrics is effectively decoupling these parameters. These relationships are quantified in the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, where a ZT of 1 is considered commercially viable. A method was developed to determine the thermoelectric efficiency of a material system over a range of conductivities using only a few experimental data points. This allows for more efficient mapping of a material system for thermoelectrics. Using this analysis, high temperature measurements show that carrier scattering from rare earth impurities compensates the enhancement from thermally generated carriers, giving Si the potential to be a better thermoelectric dopant in InGaAs at high temperature. Extrapolating temperature dependent measurements to higher temperatures shows that a ZT greater than 3 should be theoretically possible for Gd or Si doped InGaAs at 700C.",,,
516,"Brahmans Beyond Nationalism, Muslims Beyond Dominance : A Hidden History of North Indian Classical Music's Hinduization","This dissertation challenges two key assumptions that structure nearly all historical accounts of modern North Indian classical music: (1) that Muslim musicians imposed a ""secretive"" and ""jealously guarded"" monopoly over the field from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries and (2) that upper-caste Hindus eventually penetrated this monopoly only by the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries under the protective umbrella of a nationalist musical reform movement. Both assumptions attempt to explain a demographic shift among musicians from a Muslim to a Hindu majority over the twentieth century. Though recent scholarship has begun to suggest a more complex reality, most accounts still presume a neat sequence of two consecutive ""dominances"" characterized by intrinsic cultural essences: the first, (intransigent, insular and pre-modern) Muslim; and the second, (nationalistic, communalistic and modern) Hindu. Nearly all of this research, moreover, is based on a limited set of data generally dated no earlier than the 1870s and thus within the nationalist period of musical reform. My research, reaching a full century earlier to a period that set the stage for a later Hindu-led reform, reveals a rather different picture. Specifically, I highlight the role of several overlooked factors that led Brahmans to take up music much earlier than is commonly recognized during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and that may have continued to inform Brahman participation well into the twentieth. These include: the British colonial policy of indirect rule (Chapter One); the legacy of pre-colonial traditions of Mughal patronage (Chapter Two); the persistence of the claim to continuities within the musical theoretical treatise tradition (Chapter Three); and---contrary to the stereotype---the pedagogical generosity of Muslim musicians (Chapters, Four, Five and Six). All of these factors are illustrated by a historical study of a prominent Brahman family from the central Indian city of Ujjain, the Ashtewales, who first entered music as patrons and apprentices of Muslim hereditary professionals in the early nineteenth century, but who eventually became hereditary professionals themselves in the mid-twentieth century. Their example suggests a need to reconfigure commonly held understandings of the roots of contemporary communal realities in music.",,,
517,Effects of an Exotic Plant Invasion on Arthropod Assemblages,"The meta-analysis showed negative effects of non-native plant invasions on arthropod richness, which are in part determined by the abundance of the invader, and are greatest at high levels of invader abundance (70% cover or greater). My field research showed that these effects vary by site, season, and sampling technique/stratum, and are apparently modulated by the characteristics of both the invader and the invasion itself, including growth patterns, litter production, invader abundance, and native plant diversity. Even a relatively small amount of Carpobrotus edulis has negative effects on arthropod abundance, richness, and composition, with an exponential decrease in abundance and richness and a shift in composition well before 50% Carpobrotus cover. Changes in feeding guilds and composition helped to suggest the drivers of these patterns, and revealed a particularly strong effect on fossorial arthropods, likely related to the dense rooting structure of Carpobrotus. Thus, while the negative effects of non-native plant invasions typically increase with increasing invader cover, the form of this relationship is determined by the attributes of both the invader and the invaded system. For my dissertation work, I asked what effect non-native plant invasions are having on entire arthropod assemblages, and how that effect is related to the degree of invasion. I further asked how the responses by component feeding guilds contribute to these relationships. I answered these questions by conducting a meta-analysis and review of existing studies, then investigating the effects of one invader, Carpobrotus edulis, on coastal dune arthropods at four different coastal California sites. At Vandenberg Air Force Base, Montana de Oro State Park, and San Buenaventura State Beach, I utilized unmanipulated Carpobrotus populations to compare paired invaded and uninvaded patches and to investigate a gradient of Carpobrotus infestation. At Coal Oil Point Reserve, I conducted an experimental restoration trial, removing varying amounts of Carpobrotus and re-vegetating with native dune plants. Invertebrate responses to plant invasions can help delineate the drivers of biodiversity and community patterns, thus guiding the conservation and restoration of diverse native ecosystems. Although it is well known that invasive species have pervasive effects on native communities and ecosystems, our knowledge of the relative contributions of, and interactions among, key factors determining invader impacts is limited. Among potentially key factors is invader abundance, but few studies have examined its relationship to community structure. Those studies have shown varying relationships between invertebrate assemblages and invader cover, illustrating the need for additional studies on the forms and mechanisms of relationships between invertebrate biodiversity and invasive plant abundance.",,,
518,"The role of fluctuating food supply on recruitment, survival and population dynamics in the sea","Collectively, these chapters highlight the importance of considering complex interactions and nonlinearities in dynamics of marine species. This collection of work focuses on dynamics of two marine taxa with very different life histories, both of whom are sensitive to changes in food supply. Chapters 1 and 2 focus on black surfperch (Embiotoca jacksoni), a direct developer with internal reproduction while chapters 3 and 4 focus on the purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) a broadcast spawner with pelagic larvae. Chapter 1 was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society: B in 2012, and is co-authored by Russ Schmitt, Sally Holbrook and Dan Reed. In this chapter I used long-term data on surfperch and their prey to illustrate how variability food for surfperch corresponds to changes in the number of young that adults produce and how well those young survive. Chapter 2 provides evidence that survival in adult surfperch responded to both prey availability and competition among adults. This work is a collaboration with Russ Schmitt and Sally Holbrook. Chapter 3 focuses on fertilization dynamics in sea urchins and the role that varying egg concentrations during spawning can have on the rate of fertilization when mixed with sperm. I conducted laboratory experiments and developed new models to show that the per capita rate of interactions among eggs and sperm slow down as egg concentrations increase. Finally, in chapter 4 I used a 23-year dataset of larval settlement of purple urchins at seven sites to investigate whether settlement patterns were related to major climatic and biological variables including food supply and temperature. This chapter is an ongoing collaboration with Steve Schroeter, Dan Reed and several others. These analyses show a strong, negative relationship between settlement and El Nino cycles as well as temperature in southern California, indicating that multi-year fluctuations in climate may regulate the patterns of settlement that are highly variable in time.",,,
519,Ethnic socialization and ethnic identity in Korean American adolescents and young adults : The relative roles of parents and friends,"Chapter 4 reports the results of the study. T-tests were used to verify whether ethnic socialization messages were experienced within the surveyed members of the population and the study confirms that Korean American adolescents and young adults experienced having ethnic socialization conversations with parents and with friends. Multivariate regressions were conducted to examine the influences of the two sources of ethnic socialization on ethnic identity separately. The global construct of parent ethnic socialization significantly predicted exploration and resolution and the global construct of friend ethnic socialization significantly predicted exploration. Finally structural equation modeling was used to model each of the three subcomponents of ethnic socialization from each source and the three dimensions of ethnic identity simultaneously. Only parent promotion of mistrust significantly predicted exploration; whereas all three friend ethnic socialization components predicted all three aspects of ethnic identity. To contribute to the growing research on ethnic identity development, this dissertation examined the influences of parent and peer ethnic socialization on Korean American ethnic identity. Ethnic identity was defined using three dimensions: exploration, resolution, and affect. Exploration refers to the extent to which one has explored one's ethnic heritage. Resolution refers to a feeling of reaching a comfortable ethnic identity after exploration. Affect refers to the feelings one has towards one's ethnic identity. Ethnic socialization was defined as having three subcomponents: cultural socialization, preparation for bias, and promotion of mistrust. Cultural socialization refers to conversations regarding one's history, culture, food, and other ethnic background knowledge. Preparation for bias refers to conversations regarding the bias that one may experience in greater society. Promotion of mistrust refers to conversations suggesting the individual keep distance from those of other ethnic and racial backgrounds. Ethnic identity has been identified as being significantly related to both academic achievement and psychological well-being. Thus, the healthy and secure achievement of ethnic identity is an important developmental task. Chapter 3 introduces the participants of the study and the methodologies used to answer the research question. Three-hundred and twenty-two Korean American adolescents and young adults were surveyed using an instrument made up several modified survey measures. The Ethnic Identity Scale (Umana-Taylor, Yazedjian, & Bamaca-Gomez, 2004) was modified and shortened. Questions previously asked to parents about their racial socialization practices (Hughes & Chen, 1997; Hughes & Johnson, 2001) were modified to fit the study's design of surveying adolescent and young adults about their perceived experiences having conversations with their parents and their friends. A pilot study was conducted preliminarily in order to test the validity of the survey instrument's use on this population and the results of the pilot study are included in this chapter. Further discussions regarding the findings, limitations and suggestions for further research are included in chapter 5. Ethnic identity and ethnic socialization were examined in a relatively understudied subpopulation of interest, Korean Americans. The Korean American community is typically viewed as being successful, based on the high proportions of those who hold postsecondary degrees and a median income that is higher than general median income for the United States (U.S. Census, 2011). However, adolescents in the community also experience mental and physical health challenges. The literature review in this dissertation discusses the role of ethnic identity in adolescent development, parent ethnic socialization, and the role of friends during adolescence. The literature suggests that friend ethnic socialization may be an important variable that has not been fully explored in research on ethnic identity development. The review concludes with the research questions examined in this dissertation.",,,
520,The Ethnic Identity Development of Southeast Asian American College Students : Experiences across Academic and Social Contexts,"Results of the study showed that Southeast Asian Americans who were committed to their ethnic identities prior to college continued to explore their ethnic identities in college. Ethnic exploration occurred predominantly within social spaces, such as within ethnic student organizations. Parents' prior ethnic socialization continued to influence whether students were committed to their ethnic identities. Although participation in ethnic practices and traditions had generally declined in college, students maintained cultural beliefs and values that were conducive towards academic success and college persistence. With respect to college integration, students were generally socially integrated only within ethnic- and racial-related spaces. Contrary to what was expected, female students remained committed to their ethnic group even if they were in disagreement with their parents' and ethnic community's traditional gender expectations. Lastly, the findings suggested that choices in ethnic and racial identity labels varied across contexts and that ethnic identity was relevant to student development and possibly college success. The Southeast Asian American students' cultural identities contributed to their social integration, and that social integration supported the students' overall persistence in college. This study included individual interviews with a sample of 27 Southeast Asian American students that were all attending the same four-year university in California. Participants were recruited from campus spaces that were predicted to have a large Southeast Asian American presence. The interview guide addressed students' prior ethnic socialization experiences before entering college and also students' ethnic- and non-ethnic-based experiences since arriving to college. Participants were asked specific questions pertaining to ethnic identity exploration and commitment. Line-by-line coding was conducted on the interview transcripts and themes were organized across the interviews to address the four major research questions of the study. The perception of the high-achieving Asian American student can make invisible the challenges these students face as ethnic minorities on their college campuses. In particular, Southeast Asian American students, such as those of Cambodian, Laotian, and Vietnamese descent, encounter additional barriers because of the circumstances of their parents' migration experiences and the ethnic socialization that occurs within their families and communities. Most current research that has been conducted on Asian Americans in higher education has not focused specifically on Southeast Asian American students. As argued by Teranishi, Behringer, Grey, and Parker (2009), college student development models may not be inclusive of the experiences of Southeast Asian American students, especially since those models may not account for how academic development can intersect with students' ethnic identity development. Primarily based on Tinto's (1975) college retention model, this present study examined the college integration and ethnic identity development of a sample of Southeast Asian American undergraduate students.",,,
521,The Dynamics of Serotonin Receptor Expression in the Developing Forebrain,"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) serves an important modulatory role in the entire central nervous system (CNS), and serotonergic abnormalities have been implicated in many mental disorders. All of the CNS supply of 5-HT originates in the brainstem raphe nuclei. The midbrain dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) sends widespread projections to the forebrain but receives direct input from only a small number of forebrain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We hypothesized that prenatal perturbations of 5-HT levels may alter the forebrain expression of 5-HT receptors (5-HTRs) in a time-sensitive manner and that these changes may result in persistent changes of the forebrain control of the DRN. Specifically, this thesis investigated the susceptibility of 5-HTR expression in the embryonic mouse telencephalon to chronic and acute perturbations of 5-HT levels and examined the effects of altered 5-HT 4R expression on the synaptic structure of the mPFC-DRN projection. These studies demonstrated (i) that acute and chronic perturbations of 5-HT levels affect the expression of 5-HT1AR, 5-HT 2AR, and 5-HT4R in the embryonic forebrain and (ii) that altered 5-HT4R expression affects the development of the synaptic connectivity between mPFC terminals and DRN serotonergic neurons. These findings suggest that prenatal serotonergic perturbations can strongly influence the development of the prefrontal control of 5-HT signaling and have long-term consequences for behavioral responses later in life.",,,
522,"Lord in the Temple, Lord in the Tomb The Hindu Temple and Its Relationship to the Samadhi Shrine Tradition of Jnanesvar Maharaj","In part II of my study, I consider the samadhi shrine as an expression of sacred space, which contributes to our knowledge of a prevalent and significant form of sacred space in the Indian religious milieu that has received relatively little attention. The study specifically concerns the samadhi shrine compound of Jnaneshvar Maharaj (thirteenth century C.E.), the founding guru of the Varkari tradition, and to a certain extent, the broader network of samadhi shrines associated with the this Maharashtrian bhakti movement. I argue that the Varkari tradition's understanding of the perfected body of the realized saint, as expressed by Jnaneshvar himself, allows for the saint's body to be revered as a murti and the space of the surrounding samadhi shrine to function as a particular kind of temple. Moreover, I show that, as in the case of the Minak_hi-Sundareshvara and Vi____hal temples discussed in Part I, this understanding of the samadhi shrine as a ""living space"" dictates the manner in which the space is engaged with by its devotees over time, generating a particularized mythico-historical personality of place. In extension, I posit that the samadhi shrines of the Varkari tradition form a dynamic network of sacred sites that is anchored at its hub by the Vi____hal Temple in Pa_harpur and constitute a complex sacred geography that traverses the entire landscape of Maharashtra. ""Lord in the Temple, Lord in the Tomb"" is a sustained analysis of Hindu samadhi shrine burial practice and its relation to broader Hindu temple traditions. The study is structured as a two-part exploration of Hindu sacred space. Part I is an extended study of the development of Hindu temple traditions, from their roots in Vedic ritual structures to their full flowering in the ideology of temple design delineated in the Vastu-Shastras and Shilpa-Shastras. Central to the development of the Hindu temple is the understanding of the space as pervaded by the living presence of the deity who is housed within in the form of a murti (sculpted image). I provide a sustained analysis of two particular temple traditions, one Shaiva and one Vai_h_ava---the Minak_hi-Sundareshvara temple complex in Madurai and the Vi____hal temple compound in Pa_harpur---to illustrate how the understanding of the temple as a ""living space"" dictates the manner in which the space is interacted with over time, leading to what I call a mythico-historical personality of place. I highlight the process by which the temple space is continually re-inscribed with new layers of meaning through the devotees' repeated encounters with that space over time.",,,
523,Host-Pathogen Interactions Influencing Bacterial Countermeasures,"Infectious diseases cause one in four deaths worldwide. Emerging infectious diseases continue to threaten public health on a global scale as novel zoonotic pathogens cause human disease, strains of existing microbes develop antimicrobial resistance, and the spread of pathogens alters as a result of human activities. Novel strategies are required to contain these emerging pathogens and reduce their impact on society. In order to optimize the development of such countermeasures, the interactions between host and pathogen and their impact on the efficacy of vaccination and antibiotic therapy must be elucidated. Here we describe the challenges emerging pathogens present to society using several recent outbreaks as examples of how human activity has collided with microbial evolution to create worldwide health crises and support the urgent need for novel therapeutics and strategies to counter these pathogens. Collectively, this work supports the development of novel strategies to counter emerging bacterial pathogens by evaluating the interactions that underlie vaccine-elicited cross-protective immunity and the induction of transient antibiotic resistance during infection. This is followed by the rational design of a live-attenuated vaccine for the zoonotic pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis that elicits cross-protective immunity against several clinically relevant serotypes. A vaccine that elicits heterologous protection against a variety of pathogenic serotypes is ideal for mitigating illness in humans and animals, especially for use in the livestock industry. The final part of this dissertation discusses the identification of transient antibiotic resistance evident in Salmonella only upon infection of a host or in host-mimicking conditions. This phenotype characterized by inducible high-level antibiotic resistance, termed transient in vivo antibiotic resistance (TIVAR), is rapidly induced and reversible and only occurs within certain host compartments (tissue-specific). TIVAR results in antibiotic treatment failure and the enhanced selection of stable resistance.",,,
524,Design and Fabrication of Sub-100nm Base-Emitter Junctions of THz InP DHBTs,"It has been deduced from the model that the current originated from Auger recombination and lateral electron diffusion (via the surface and the bulk base semiconductor) are the dominant components that limit DC-beta. To suppress the diffusion current via surface, a process flow is developed to form passivating sidewall onto the base surface. Such process flow has already been incorporated into DHBT fabrication. Moreover, new geometries for the base-emitter junction have been designed on the purpose of reducing the Auger recombination rate and lateral electron diffusion in the bulk base region. According to the simulation results, the new designs could potentially improve DC-beta beyond 50 if the corresponding process flow could be adequately integrated. Experimentally, a reduction of current gain (beta) associated with device scaling has been observed. In order to assess the causes of the reduction, the electron transport in the base is emulated by a commercial simulator. A model for DC-beta at high injection current density (25 mA/mum 2) was constructed by the comparison between the experimental and the simulation results. The model allows the estimation of beta which benefits the design of the future scaling generations of DHBTs. Because of their wide RF bandwidth (~1 THz) and high breakdown voltages (BVCEO >3 V), npn-In0.53Ga0.47 As/InP double heterojunction bipolar transistors (DHBTs) have extensive applications in monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) such as high performance transceivers, near-terabit optical fiber link, and THz amplifiers in radar/imaging systems. The improvements in the performance of DHBTs were made possible because of device scaling. As the technology advances towards the next scaling generations, new challenges in the manufacturing techniques and the device designs are met. The purpose of this work is to provide solutions to the problems encountered in the fabrication and design of the base-emitter junction while scaling from 200 to sub-100 nm emitter width. Two important issues regarding the base-emitter junction arises while scaling towards sub-100 nm emitter width. The process flow for the refractory emitter metal stack developed for 250-100 nm emitter width has already reached its limitation. In order to improve the transistor yield at a reduced linewidth without designing a new process flow, revisions have been made to the existing one. Employing the revised process flow, 75 nm-wide emitter is feasible. The overall transistor yield has also been improved. This increases the number of working devices per sample, enabling thorough device analyses.",,,
525,Nanometer-scale engineering of shallow spins in diamond,"A crystal growth technique enabling to control the depth of a single nitro-gen-vacancy (NV) center at nanometer scale in diamond is developed. This nitrogen delta-doping technique during the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) of diamond enables to create near-surface NV centers whose depths ranging from about 100 nm down to less than 2 nm while preserving their spin coherence times. The nitrogen delta-doping technique is combined with shallow 12C ion implantation through lithographically-patterned apertures to demonstrate three-dimensional (3D) localization of single NV centers at nanometer scale. The demonstrated long spin coherence times of 3D-localized NV centers pave a way towards quantum applications by maximizing their interactions to the diamond-based nanostructures. These shallowly doped, long-coherence NV centers are used as an atomic-scale magnetic sensor that enables to detect nuclear spin signal from an organic sample of a nanometer-scale volume external to the diamond crystal. Extension of this nanometer-scale nuclear magnetic resonance (nanoNMR) to two-dimensional nanometer-scale magnetic resonance imaging (2D nanoMRI) is also presented.",,,

527,Rethinking How Proteins Move Along DNA,"We investigate the facilitated diffusion properties of E. coli DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam), which methylates palindromic 5'-GATC-3' sites on the N6 position of adenine. We use an in vitro steady-state processivity assay, where the ability of the enzyme to catalyze multiple methylations within a single binding event is quantified. Our results are suggestive of a new mechanism, intersegmental hopping, where proteins hop between regions of a single DNA molecule that are looped together. This mechanism allows for efficient long-range movements, and is similar to other ambiguously described looping mechanisms proposed in recent reports. Dam's low cellular copy number and need to move along the entire bacterial chromosome (i.e. its biological context) is ideally accommodated by this mechanism, as we imagine will be true for other proteins with low copy numbers and rare sites. We also demonstrate that EcoRI ENase uses an extreme sliding mechanism, previously hypothesized to be unlikely. EcoRI ENase and EcoRV ENase both cut incoming phage DNA as part of type II restriction modification systems, and are shown here to use distinct facilitated diffusion mechanisms. We argue that their site finding mechanisms are complimentary, ensuring robust phage defense, again demonstrating the connection between facilitated diffusion and biological context. Dam was previously demonstrated to undergo intrasite processivity, where the methylation of both strands within a single GATC site proceeds by a single Dam enzyme dramatically reorienting itself while switching between strands. Here, we show that intrasite processivity is only possible on long stretches of DNA when GATC sites are clustered. GATC sites are clustered in most known and putative Dam methylation dependent epigenetic operons, which involve transitions from uniquely unmethylated GATC sites to fully methylated ones. Intrasite processivity is therefore postulated as necessary for epigenetic gene regulation by Dam. Site-specific DNA binding by proteins is critical for diverse biological processes, including gene regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication, immune response, and others. In most cases, this binding is preceded by facilitated diffusion, where the protein passively moves along nonspecific DNA (DNA lacking particular binding sites) in search of its site(s). Details concerning the mechanisms of how proteins move along DNA remain unclear yet actively investigated. Several reports claim that facilitated diffusion relies primarily on sliding and hopping processes, where the protein moves along the trajectory of the DNA helix. However, these mechanisms involve redundant searches over local regions (up to hundreds of base pairs), while site finding in vivo requires searches of hundreds of thousands of base pairs. We ""rethink"" facilitated diffusion in two ways: 1) what are the mechanisms available for facilitated diffusion? And 2) how are these mechanisms driven by proteins' specific biological context? Furthermore, we show that Dam is able to move along DNA in spite of pre-incubated protein roadblocks. Provocatively, DNA-loop inducing roadblocks, such as the histone-like Lrp, can improve the translocation process by specifically enhancing intersegmental hopping. Therefore, this mechanism is proposed as a general way for proteins to move along the crowded, compacted genomic DNA landscape.",,,
528,Effects of Fiber Architecture on Damage and Failure in C/SiC Composites,"Textile architecture is found to influence composite response at four length-scales: the panel, the coupon, the tow, and the sub-tow. At the panel scale, distortions to the architecture introduced during weaving or handling of the fabric influence the packing density and the relative rotation of tows. Even when large distortions are intentionally introduced their influence on mechanical response is minimal. At the coupon scale the tow architecture has the largest effects on composite mechanical response. Young's modulus, ultimate tensile strength, and strain to failure are all influenced. Changes in each of these are a function of tow shape, tow anisotropy, and the degree of constraint provided by the matrix. At the tow scale, architecture effects give rise to heterogeneity in measured surface strains under both tensile and thermal loading. Methods for the calibration of tow-scale elastic and thermoelastic properties were developed to enable simulation of these effects with a geometrically-accurate virtual model. Virtual tensile and thermal tests using this model have indicated that interaction between tows has an important influence on local strains. At the sub-tow scale, architecture effects influence the location of matrix cracking. Simulations of the cooling cycle following matrix processing predict that matrix cracks should develop in the matrix above underlying tows due to thermal expansion mismatch between the tows and the matrix. This is consistent with experimental observations. Two methods are presented to extend the virtual tests to explicitly simulate the onset and evolution of these cracks. Carbon-fiber/SiC-matrix composites are under development for applications in hypersonic vehicles due to their exceptional capabilities at high temperatures. As a subset of these materials, textile-based composites are of particular interest because they offer the possibility of accommodating complex geometries and features in engineering components. Among the numerous obstacles hindering the widespread adoption of these composites, two are addressed in the present work: (i) the incomplete understanding of the influence of textile architecture on thermoelastic properties, damage initiation and failure, and (ii) the lack of robust computational tools for predicting their thermomechanical performance at the appropriate length scales. Accordingly, an experimental study is performed of the thermal and mechanical properties of several prototypical textile C/SiC composites with various fiber architectures. In turn, the experimental results are used to guide the development of computational tools for predicting composite response that explicitly account for fiber architecture.",,,
529,Patterning Surfaces using Block Copolymer Polymer Thin Films and Polymer Brushes Synthesized by a Light-Mediated Controlled Radical Polymerization Technique,"Polymeric materials are ideal for modifying the properties of a wide range of surfaces due to their structural and chemical versatility. This dissertation describes the synthesis and utility of block copolymers and polymer brushes for patterning surfaces. The effect of a cyclic molecular architecture on feature size in phase separated block copolymer thin films is discussed, as well as the synthesis of acid-cleavable block copolymers for the fabrication of highly ordered nanoporous polymer thin films. In addition to polymers synthesized in solution for deposition onto surfaces, the synthesis of polymer brushes by surface-initiated polymerizations was also studied. A new light-mediated polymerization technique catalyzed by Ir(ppy)3 was employed as the surface-initiated polymerization technique. This polymerization is highly responsive to visible light and can be used to readily access patterns of polymer brushes. Using light as an external stimulus for brush growth or functionalization by a light-mediated atom transfer radical addition reaction, the molecular weight, architecture, grafting density, and chemical functionality of polymer brushes could be spatially controlled on surfaces. Finally, the synthesis of polymers by the Ir(ppy)3-catalyzed polymerization in solution was improved by utilizing a continuous flow reactor.",,,
530,Modeling of Oxidation Embrittlement of SiC/SiC Composites,"In the model for internal oxidation of SiC/BN/SiC composite, the primary phenomena considered are: (i) inward diffusion of gaseous oxidants through narrow matrix cracks, (ii) recession of the BN fiber coatings through formation, volatilization and outward diffusion of gaseous boron hydroxide species, and (iii) silica scale growth on the exposed fibers and matrix crack surfaces. Closure of the gap created by BN removal is also taken into account. The model predicts spatial and temporal evolutions of silica scale thickness, BN recession depth and concentrations of gaseous species within the matrix crack. Over the range of temperatures (700C-900C) and environments (10-50% H 2O in O2) considered, simulation results indicate that the BN recession rate is essentially controlled by transport of the gaseous reaction products within the matrix crack and gap closure by silica scale formation. One consequence is that, when the opening displacement of the matrix crack is small (ca. 1 microm), recession is confined to regions close to the free surface of the composite. Otherwise, when the opening displacement is large (ca. 100 microm), recession occurs uniformly across the panel thickness. Additionally, throughout the selected parameter space, the terminal extent of BN recession increases monotonically with water content and BN thickness but decreases with temperature. Another potentially critical step in the embrittlement process is the premature fracture of SiC fibers induced by oxidation. Stress rupture of SiC/SiC composites at intermediate temperatures in oxidizing environments is the result of a series of internal chemical and thermomechanical processes that lead to premature, localized fiber fracture. We have developed analytical models for two potentially critical steps in this process. The first involves the generation of tensile stresses in the fibers due to SiO2 scale formation (following removal of fiber coatings) and the associated reduction in the applied stress needed for fiber fracture. The second occurs once the gaps produced by coating removal are filled with oxide and subsequent oxidation occurs subject to the constraints imposed by the matrix crack faces. In this domain, the failure model is couched in terms of the stress intensification within the fibers caused by constrained oxidation. The models incorporate the combined kinetic effects of oxide growth and viscous flow. The competing effects of increased oxidation rate and accelerated stress relaxation with increasing temperature on fiber stress feature prominently in the results. The results suggest that, in dry air environments, the highest risk of fiber fracture occurs at temperatures in the range 840-940C. In this range, the oxide scales grow at appreciable rates yet the resulting growth stresses cannot be mitigated sufficiently rapidly by viscous flow. This work focuses on oxidation-induced embrittlement of SiC/BN/SiC composites at intermediate temperatures and develops models for several critical phenomena involved in the process. The primary phenomena studied include internal oxidation of the constituent materials of the composite, the stress evolution in SiC fibers due to silica scales formation on fiber surfaces, the stress concentration caused by constrained silica growth, and the consequent fiber fractures in the composite.",,,
531,Ruthenium Nitrosyl Salen and Salophen PhotoNORMS : Biological Studies and Applications towards Small Molecule Delivery Platforms,"Photochemical release of NO allows for specific location, timing, and dosage of a drug and has the potential to limit wide spread side-effects common to chemotherapy treatments. Several novel ruthenium nitrosyls have been synthesized and studied for their photoactive nitric oxide release. Compounds were characterized by mass spectroscopy, NMR, UV-visible spectra, IR, elemental analysis, photochemical reactivity and ability to release NO. Quantum yields and efficiency measurements were conducted by monitoring the moles of NO produced due to light irradiation. The release of NO was detected by a Nitric Oxide Analyzer in real time. Two major compounds will be discussed, a water soluble, water stable ruthenium nitrosyl for applications in biological systems and a hydrophobic ruthenium nitrosyl variant which was infused into a polymer matrix with up-converting nanoparticles (UCNP). The water soluble compound Ru(NO)(salen-CO2H)Cl 1, has been studied for its photochemistry, cytotoxicity on a murine melanoma cancer cell line, and vasodilation in murine aortic rings. The hydrophobic compound, Ru(NO)(salophen)Cl, was loaded into a polymer matrix with UCNP, utilizing unique properties of UCNPs to shift the excitation wavelength into the near infrared region, where there is better tissue penetration of light. This document contains the synthetic, photochemical, and studies on the efficiency of NO release for each compound. Nitric oxide (NO) is an endogenously produced small molecule involved in neural transmission, immune response, and blood pressure regulation. The radical nature of NO has also been studied for its ability to increase radiation damage in hypoxic cells, thus improving radiation chemotherapy. In this vein, we are committed to generating molecules that utilize an external trigger to allow for controlled release of NO in biology.",,,
532,Experimental and Computational Investigations of Organic and Hybrid Solar Cells,"Organic and hybrid solar cells are complex, nanostructured devices, for which an in-depth understanding is required to improve and optimize. Both types of solar cells take advantage of the strong optical absorption of organic chromophores to collect sunlight and have reached maximum efficiencies of around 12% as of the end of 2014. They both also rely on nanostructures and interfaces to balance energy and charge transport. Despite these underlying similarities, organic solar cells and dye sensitized solar cells present different challenges to optimization. We have applied experimental and computational techniques to help explore and understand factors that affect their efficiencies and describe and predict strategies for improving them. We made a comparative study of two isostructural donor molecules and studied the exciton and charge transport in a non-fullerene acceptor molecule in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. We then wrote a kinetic Monte Carlo simulation to study energy transfer in donor-acceptor systems and applied it to study trapping kinetics in different morphologies, energy relay dyes in dye sensitized solar cells, and energy cascades in bilayer organic solar cells. Based on these simulations, we offer design suggestions for both types of solar cells.",,,
533,"Modeling and Computation of Immersed, Flexible Boundaries in Complex Fluids","This thesis consists of two main parts related to the modeling and computation of elastic, immersed fiber-like structures in non-Newtonian flows. We focus on the particular case of a flexible, microscopic swimmer which is modeled as an immersed sheet of finite extent in a two-dimensional, incompressible viscoelastic flow at zero Reynolds number. The swimmer is imposed a beating pattern or gait based on a given target curvature. In the first part, we present a comprehensive numerical investigation of such a swimmer in an Oldroyd-B fluid. An efficient semi-implicit version of the Immersed Boundary Method is employed to remove the impeding time-step limitation, induced by the strong interfacial forces needed to appropriately impose the swimmer's gait and inextensibility. Our study investigates in detail, for the first time, the important effects of the domain size, the stiffness parameters enforcing the constraints, and numerical resolution and dissipation. It is found that when the gait is accurately enforced, the mean propulsion speed of the swimmer always decreases monotonically with Deborah number De, which is a measure of the flow's viscoelasticity, i.e. viscoelasticity hinders locomotion. We observe that this monotonic ordering can be broken when the enforcement of the gait is sufficiently relaxed but without viscoelastic swimmer's mean speed surpassing that of the Newtonian swimmer. More importantly, our investigation reveals that the addition of dissipation in the polymeric stress invariably enhances locomotion and can lead to a speed-up with respect to the Newtonian swimmer. This result clarifies and reconciles several seemingly contradictory existing numerical and experimental results and identifies diffusive transport of momentum via the addition of polymeric stress dissipation as the main mechanism which can produce a swimmer's speed-up in the viscoelastic fluid. The second part of of this thesis presents a novel multi-scale approach for the computation of the same type of finite swimmer but in a FENE (Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic) fluid. The FENE model overcomes the main limitation of the Oldroyd B fluid which is the possibility of infinite extensions to the polymer chains (modeled as elastic dumbbells) but it requires a full resolution of the dynamics in the polymer's configuration space to evaluate the polymeric stress. When coupled with a flow, this becomes a highly dimensional multi-scale problem which is common to most models of complex fluids arising from kinetic theory and represents a formidable computational challenge. Here, we exploit that the flow affected by the non-inertial swimmer is highly localized and hence an adaptive multi-resolution approach can be effectively implemented. We combine this multi-resolution strategy with a robust, spectral method to solve cost-effectively for the polymer chain dynamics in configuration space. The overall adaptive, multi-resolution method offers a significant computational improvement over the direct approach, being about seven faster for this particular application.",,,
535,Exciton Diffusion Length in Solution-Processed Small Molecules,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have the potential to be a cost-efficient, clean, and renewable energy source. A fundamental process in OPV devices which directly impacts the device performance is the diffusion length of Coulombically bound electron-hole pairs or excitons. It is therefore important to investigate how chemical structure and processing conditions impact the exciton diffusion length. This study is difficult to perform with the current body of literature since compounds in separate works differ by a number of chemical modifications. Comparisons between works are further complicated by the use of different techniques to measure the exciton diffusion length. To resolve these issues, the first aim of this dissertation is to compare the fabrication, measurement, and analysis procedure for six different techniques to measure exciton diffusion length. We find that bulk quenching techniques are preferred over surface quenching techniques which require elaborate fabrication procedures, multiple measurements, and a number of assumptions in the analysis process. The second aim of this dissertation is to investigate how chemical structure and processing conditions impact the exciton diffusion length. We find that decreasing the conjugation length in a small molecule leads to an enhancement in the exciton diffusion length while replacing the linear alkyl chains with bulky ethyl hexyl groups has no significant effect. Lastly, we show that processing films with a high boiling point solvent leads to an enhancement in the exciton trap density which directly reduces the exciton diffusion length.",,,
536,Improving Location Accuracy And Network Capacity In Mobile Networks,"In this dissertation, we build effective and practical solutions to address these challenges. Our first research area is to develop new localization mechanisms that utilize the rich set of sensors on smartphones to implement accurate localization systems. We propose two designs. The first system tracks distance to nearby devices with centimeter accuracy by transmitting acoustic signals between the devices. We design robust and efficient signal processing algorithms that measure distances accurately on the fly, thus enabling real-time user motion tracking. Our second system locates a transmitting device in real-time using commodity smart- phones. Driving by the insight that rotating a wireless receiver (smartphone) around a users body can effectively emulate the sensitivity and functionality of a directional antenna, we design a rotation-based measurement algorithm that can accurately predict the direction of the target transmitter and locate the transmitter with a few measurements. Todays mobile computing must support a wide variety of applications such as location-based services, navigation, HD media streaming and augmented reality. Providing such services requires large network bandwidth and precise localization mechanisms, which face significant challenges. First, new (real-time) localization mechanisms are needed to locate neighboring devices/objects with high accuracy under tight environment constraints, e.g. without infrastructure support. Second, mobile networks need to deliver orders of magnitude more bandwidth to support the exponentially increasing traffic demand, and adapt resource usage to user mobility. Our second research area is to develop next generation mobile networks to significantly boost network capacity. We propose a drastically new outdoor picocell design that leverages millimeter wave 60GHz transmissions to provide multi-Gbps bandwidth for mobile users. Using extensive measurements on off-the-shelf 60GHz radios, we explore the feasibility of 60GHz picocells by characterizing range, attenuation due to reflections, sensitivity to movement and blockage, and interference in typical urban environments. Our results dispel some common myths on 60GHz, and show that 60GHz outdoor picocells are indeed a feasible approach for delivering orders of magnitude increase in network capacity. Finally, we seek to capture and understand user mobility patterns which are essential in mobile network design and deployment. While traditional methods of collecting human mobility traces are expensive and not scalable, we explore a new direction that extracts large-scale mobility traces through widely available geosocial datasets, e.g. Foursquare ""check-in"" datasets. By comparing raw GPS traces against Foursquare checkins, we analyze the value of using geosocial datasets as representative traces of human mobility. We then develop techniques to both ""sanitize"" and ""repopulate"" geosocial traces, thus producing detailed mobility traces more indicative of actual human movement and suitable for mobile network design.",,,
537,The Fourier Continuation Alternating Direction Method Applied to the Heat Equation,"The results show that the method's performance is mostly immune to the varying situations although some exceptions are noted. High order spatial convergence in arbitrary domains is observed. After this we move on to original experiments. Still working with the previously mentioned domain and generation term, we compare the relation between the rate of convergence of the method and the order of the extension. This is compared to the error bounds shown in Section 4 and agreement is demonstrated. The use of the Fourier basis allows the FC-AD method to be implemented on arbitrary domains. Previously when this was attempted the truncation error near the boundaries was first order. We then perform two sets of tests. The first is where we test the heat equation without a generation term and with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions using eigenfunctions to find the error results. We do this both in a circular domain and an elliptical domain with its eccentricity varied. The FC-AD method utilizes the well known Alternating Direction method developed by Peaceman and Rachford. In the case of the heat equation, the AD method splits an n dimensional PDE into a series of n ordinary differential equations (ODEs), none of which are guaranteed to have the aforementioned boundary conditions. Normally the ODEs are solved using finite difference methods. In the FC-AD method, we add a periodic extension and take the Fourier transform of the extended function, allowing us to avoid the Gibbs phenomena. This is what gives it the name 'Fourier Continuation'. The second test is of the heat equation with a time dependent boundary. We find the error not from an analytic function but from high order polynomial interpolation. This is done in both a circular domain and an elliptical domain with its eccentricity varied. Section 5 describes the numerical experiments performed on the FC-AD method. It begins with a replication of a series of experiments conducted in [8], in which a complicated generation term in the heat equation is used to force the solution into a predetermined form inside an arbitrary domain. We use these results to validate our implementation. In Section 1 we explain how the periodic extension of a one dimensional function can be obtained, and in Section 3 we explain how to incorporate this into the Alternating Direction method. Sections 2 and 4 give bounds on the error accumulated in Sections 1 and 3 respectively, which are slightly modified versions of results first shown in. The FC-AD method is a spectral method utilizing the Fourier basis. Spectral methods utilize basis functions that are nonzero over the whole domain as opposed to finite difference methods which utilize basis functions that are nonzero only in a small portion of the domain. Both have long been used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) numerically. An advantage of spectral methods is that the error decreases exponentially for C infinity solutions. A limitation of spectral methods, specifically those utilizing the Fourier basis, is that periodic boundary conditions are required, or the Gibbs phenomena, commonly thought of as 'ringing' near discontinuities, severely reduces the accuracy of the method near the boundaries. This requirement limits the applicability of the Fourier basis, and it is precisely this limitation that the FC-AD method attempts to alleviate. This thesis experiments with and tests the Fourier Continuation Alternating Direction (FC-AD) method applied to the heat equation. This method is introduced in [6-9].",,,
538,"A Performer's Guide to Thea Musgrave's song cycle ""Songs for a Winter's Evening""","This DMA supporting document is a performer's guide to the analysis and interpretation of the song cycle ""Songs for a Winter's Evening,"" by Scottish composer Thea Musgrave. In 1996, Musgrave was commissioned by the 17 th Dumfries & Galloway Arts Festival & and 1st Burns International Festival to create a composition using some of the poetry by Robert Burns, a well-known Scottish poet. It is undisputable that Musgrave's music is linked to Burns. Her ability to reflect historically to echo Burns's time while fastening in her own contemporary compositional style make ""Songs for a Winter's Evening"" an excellent case study for today's modern voice major. The careful and detailed analysis performed in this document will help singers prepare for performing this cycle, but will largely impact a performer in a more significant way. This analysis should demonstrate the steps with which a performer should take in creating a thorough examination of a medium-large scale vocal composition. Performers can draw from the step-by-step process provided in this document, and upon reading the analysis of ""Songs for a Winter's Evening,"" the singer may use this knowledge and apply it to other works performed in the future. The challenge of this work is that it is necessary to know Burns's tunes before understanding Musgrave's composition and the history behind its genesis, especially since Musgrave incorporates the original music in both the vocal line and accompaniment throughout. I will document the material a performer can use as a supporting source in preparing for a performance of this song cycle. First, I will briefly discuss the history of the song cycle, followed by background on Thea Musgrave as a person, musician, and composer with details on her song cycle. Next I will give a short description of Robert Burns, his history and poetry, and will complete the introduction of this paper with a detailed description of the process I applied while analyzing Musgrave's cycle. I will then discuss each song in detail touching on: the history of each Burns poem and song, Musgrave's corresponding song and her inclusion and treatment of the original tune from Burns, as well as comparison and contrast between each composer. The ultimate section will be comprised of IPA and word-for-word translations for each poem.",,,
539,On the validity of geosocial mobility traces,"Mobile networking researchers have long searched for large-scale, fine-grained traces of human movement, which have remained elusive for both privacy and logistical reasons. Recently, researchers have begun to focus on geosocial mobility traces, e.g. Foursquare checkin traces, because of their availability and scale. But are we conceding correctness in our zeal for data? In this paper, we take initial steps towards quantifying the value of geosocial datasets using a large ground truth dataset gathered from a user study. By comparing GPS traces against Foursquare checkins, we find that a large portion of visited locations is missing from checkins, and most checkin events are either forged or superfluous events. We characterize extraneous checkins, describe possible techniques for their detection, and show that both extraneous and missing checkins introduce significant errors into applications driven by these traces.",,,
540,Analysis of systems in buildings using spectral Koopman operator methods,"This thesis presents a viewpoint for analyzing data-based systems using an operator-theoretic approach based on The Koopman, or composition, operator. The presented approach allows processes from measured systems to be studied in a linear setting even if the system of interest is nonlinear or ill-described. In this work we focus on numerical methods for problems emerging from building systems analysis; a setting where systems are high-dimensional and described by large data-sets (measured or simulation), but for which equations describing the system cannot be expressed analytically. In particular we present a variety of novel analysis techniques based on spectral properties of the Koopman operator that can be applied to a wide variety of applications ranging from the monitoring/visualization of spatially extended systems, model order reduction, and model calibration. Each chapter is dedicated to one specific application and the analytic tools developed for it. Numerous examples are presented to illustrates the capabilities of the framework.",,,
541,Accelerated Algorithms for Stochastic Simulation of Chemically Reacting Systems,"We have developed a new, accelerated tau-leaping algorithm for discrete stochastic simulation that make use of the fact that exact (time-dependent) solutions are known for some of the most common reaction motifs (subgraphs of the network of chemical species and reactants). This idea can be extended to spatial stochastic simulation, by treating the diffusion network as a special motif for which there is an exact time dependent solution. We describe the well-mixed and spatial stochastic time dependent solution algorithms, along with numerical experiments illustrating their effectiveness. Stochastic models are widely used in the simulation of biochemical systems at a cellular level. For well mixed models, the system state can be represented by the population of each species. The probabilities for the system to be in each state are governed by the Chemical Master Equation (CME), which is generally a huge ordinary differential equation (ODE) system. The cost of solving the CME directly is generally prohibitive, due to its huge size. The Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) provides a kinetic Monte Carlo approach to obtain the solution to the CME. It does this by simulating every reaction event in the system. A great many stochastic realizations must be performed, to obtain accurate probabilities for the states. The SSA can generate a highly accurate result, however the computation of many SSA realizations may be expensive if there are many reaction events. Tau-leaping is an approximate algorithm that can speed up the simulation for many systems. It advances the system with a selected stepsize. In each step, it directly samples the number of reaction events in each reaction channel, which yields a faster simulation than SSA. The error in tau-leaping is controlled by selecting the stepsize properly.",,,
542,Corridor Location : Generating Competitive and Efficient Route Alternatives,"A common approach to simplify a problem with numerous objectives is to combine the cost layers into a composite a priori weighted single-objective raster grid. This dissertation examines new methods used for determining a spatially diverse set of near-optimal alternatives, and develops parallel computing techniques for brute-force near-optimal path enumeration, as well as more elegant methods that take advantage of the hierarchical structure of the underlying path-tree computation to select sets of spatially diverse near optimal paths. The problem of transmission line corridor location can be considered, at best, a ""wicked"" public systems decision problem. It requires the consideration of numerous objectives while balancing the priorities of a variety of stakeholders, and designers should be prepared to develop diverse non-inferior route alternatives that must be defensible under the scrutiny of a public forum. Political elements aside, the underlying geographical computational problems that must be solved to provide a set of high quality alternatives are no less easy, as they require solving difficult spatial optimization problems on massive GIS terrain-based raster data sets. Another approach for corridor location is to simultaneously consider all objectives to determine the set of Pareto-optimal solutions between the objectives. This amounts to solving a discrete multi-objective shortest path problem, which is considered to be NP-Hard for computing the full set of non-inferior solutions. Given the difficulty of solving for the complete Pareto-optimal set, this dissertation develops an approximation heuristic to compute path sets that are nearly exact-optimal in a fraction of the time when compared to exact algorithms. This method is then applied as an upper bound to an exact enumerative approach, resulting in significant performance speedups. But as analytic computing continues to moved toward distributed clusters, it is important to optimize algorithms to take full advantage parallel computing. To that extent, this dissertation develops a scalable parallel framework that efficiently solves for the supported/convex solutions of a biobjective shortest path problem. This framework is equally applicable to other biobjective network optimization problems, providing a powerful tool for solving the next generation of location analysis and geographical optimization models. Transmission line siting methodologies have previously been developed to guide designers in this endeavor, but close scrutiny of these methodologies show that there are many shortcomings with their approaches. The main goal of this dissertation is to take a fresh look at the process of corridor location, and develop a set of algorithms that compute path alternatives using a foundation of solid geographical theory in order to offer designers better tools for developing quality alternatives that consider the entire spectrum of viable solutions. And just as importantly, as data sets become increasingly massive and present challenging computational elements, it is important that algorithms be efficient and able to take advantage of parallel computing resources.",,,
543,"Loss, Rumination, and Narrative : Chicana/o Melancholy as Generative State","This study examines representations of melancholy in Chicana/o literature. Using theory rooted in Gloria Anzaldua's Borderlands I contend that, counter to Freud, melancholy is a productive strategy of self-making for Chicana/o subjects. By reading melancholy through a Chicana/o Studies lens I illustrate that there are multiple manifestations of self and subjectivity. Using parallels between several salient images from Freud's ""Mourning and Melancholia"" and Anzaldua's Borderlands I trace instances of melancholy in a selection of Chicana/o texts. I begin my study with a brief cultural history of melancholy before discussing the parallels between the energy of melancholy and Anzaldua's theories. My work is grounded in Chicana/o Studies and I use textual, and historical analysis to illustrate how melancholy is productive rather than pathological.",,,
544,The distribution and abundance of the California horn snail at different spatial scales,"In the first chapter, I show how snail distribution and abundance was restricted by vascular vegetation, bank orientation in channels, and water depth, due to the negative effects of shading on benthic primary production. Vascular vegetation dominates the biomass of the estuaries of California and Baja California, any changes in vegetation cover will subsequently have an effect on the abundance and distribution of snails. In chapter two, I present how crabs negatively affected snails through predation and non-lethal effects that changed the behavior and diminished the growth rates of snails. Predation pressure was especially high on eggs and the smallest size classes of snails, which had been overlooked in previous predation studies. Finally, in chapter three I present results on how low temperature seems likely to set the northern extent of the horn snail's range by reducing snail performance. The California horn snail (Cerithidea californica (Haldeman, 1840) (Potamididae: Prosobranchia) dominates the heterotrophic biomass of the salt marsh estuaries of California, Baja California, and Baja California Sur. Thus, it is an ecologically important species, functioning as a significant grazer and competitor, and host to more than 19 species of trematode parasites that infect many other species of invertebrates, fish, and birds as second, intermediate, and final hosts. Any changes in the distribution and abundance of this snail would likely have strong effects throughout estuarine food webs. Here I present observational and experimental studies performed both in the laboratory and in nature that advance our knowledge about the distribution and abundance of these snails. Results also suggest a possible tradeoff between growth and reproduction and highlight that although temperature might be important, several other local variables such as predator abundance and parasitism also have a considerable effects on snail abundance and performance. Understanding what sets the distribution and abundance of horn snails at local and regional scales will allow us to better predict the effects of climate change and other anthropogenic effects on these estuarine ecosystems.",,,
545,"Bio-Inspired Adhesion, Friction and Lubrication","Dopa (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine), a post-translational modification from tyrosine (Tyr), features prominently in the mussel foot proteins (mfps), ranging from less than 5 mol % in mfp-4 to 30 mol % in mfp-5. The binding ability of the mfps to different substrates has been mostly attributed to the Dopa functionality in the protein and the role of the other peptide residues in the adhesive properties of the protein remains elusive. Here we have discovered that the adhesion between mfp-1 decapeptide films ([AKPSYPPTYK]2) and mica remained unchanged with or without the Dopa residue. This is a paradigm shift in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying adhesive properties of the mfps and calls for further inquiry into the effects of peptide residues beyond Dopa chemistry. We also developed a systematic body of work linking the adhesive performance to lengths and architectures of peptides. Dopa in a peptide sequence does not necessarily lead to the formation of cross-links between peptide films through metal chelation, and the length of the peptide is a crucial parameter for enabling metal ion mediated bridging between surfaces. More recently, we have been working on designing and characterizing small molecules that mimic the properties of the adhesive mussel foot proteins. The wet adhesion and coacervation of an adhesive protein (mfp-5) was recapitulated in an order of magnitude smaller length scale which shows cohesive properties superior to the mfps. We believe that the resulting insights into the molecular structure-function relationships will enable rational design of synthetic bio-inspired adhesives that would enable de novo (suture less) sealants for injuries and surgeries and nano-scale-adhesive applications in the semiconductor industry. Biological systems have developed elegant adaptations during its evolution to survive and perform its functions efficiently under specific environmental constrains with enormous physical demands. In this dissertation, I make an effort to understand tribological phenomena in biology and translate them into a synthetic system for engineering applications. I emphasize on adhesion, friction and lubrication in three different biologically inspired soft condensed matter as described below. Geckos can attach and detach their toes reversible in matters of milliseconds from most surfaces regardless of its roughness due to the hierarchical structure of their foot-pads. Micro-flaps mimicking the function of the micron sized setae on the gecko foot pad were fabricated and investigated for its adhesion and frictional properties in a modified surface forces apparatus (SFA). A Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model with an effective stiffness and adhesion energy parameters quantitatively described the 'contact mechanics' of the tilted micro-flaps against a smooth silica surface at the macro and micro-scales. Constant attachments and detachments occurred between the surfaces during shearing and were described by an Avalanche mechanism. These results demonstrate the significance of preload, shearing velocity, shearing distances, commensurability, and shearing direction of gecko-mimetic adhesives and provide a simple model for analyzing and/or designing such systems. Biolubrication systems show ultralow friction coefficients, remarkable wear resistance properties and are far superior to any artificial system designed to date. In this work, the role of proteins (e.g., Lubricin, Lub) and polysaccharides (e.g., Hyaluronic acid, HA) found in articular joints, and mfp-1 inspired coacervates were investigated to determine the lubrication and wear protection mechanisms conferred by the naturally occurring polymers to a mica surface. We find that Lub penetrates into a chemically bound HA on mica to form a visco-elastic gel that reduces the coefficient of friction as well as boosts the strength of the surface against abrasive wear, however, physically adsorbed HA-Lub complex were poor at conferring wear protection to mica even though it showed low friction coefficients. Similarly, coacervated mfp-1/HA rescues mica from shear induced damage only when the protein is modified with Dopa, which is responsible for attaching the coacervate to the surface. Absence of Dopa resulted in severe abrasive wear to the surfaces even under low loads (< 10 mN) during shearing. These results show that strong anchoring of polymers is crucial to protect surfaces from shear induced damage. We also demonstrate that friction coefficient is not correlated to wear.",,,
546,Wikipedia Show-Offs : IQ Signaling in Online Information Pools,"If costly signaling theory is correct, contributions to online information pools must contain signals of some kind, signaling should be more intense under conditions where signalers are potentially rewarded by receivers, and receivers should be able to reliably infer signal content from contributions. This thesis tested whether contributions to ostensible wiki-style encyclopedias signal intelligence, group commitment, introversion-extraversion, or conscientiousness. To induce motivation, participants made their wiki-style contributions under conditions where they believed themselves to be either identifiable to receivers (i.e., and motivated to signal) or not. Contribution quality increased with participant intelligence, and, consistent with costly signaling theory, this was true only when participants believed they were identifiable to receivers. Online information pools such as Wikipedia, Youtube, and Reddit, rely on contributions from members to succeed. These venues operate as public goods, being non-excludable and non-rival, and they typically do not compensate contributors. As such, contributions appear to be altruistic, and the enterprise subject to collective action problems, such as free riding. Despite this, the internet is replete with examples of successful information pools. A potential but un-tested explanation for altruism in this context is found in costly signaling theory. Costly signaling theory assumes that altruism is apparent rather than real; signals are in fact genetically self-interested acts that are compensated by receivers. Further, receivers reliably inferred contributor intelligence from judgments of contribution quality, but only in when participants were identifiable. There was no evidence for signaling of other qualities. The findings suggest that contributions to online information pools are not examples of altruism, but are in fact signals of intelligence that are reliably inferred by receivers from contribution quality. Recommendations for future research and practical implications are discussed.",,,
547,Impacts of Climate Variability on Surface Energy and Water Budgets in sub-Saharan Africa,"This dissertation research examines impacts of weather and climate on vegetation productivity in geographically diverse areas of east Africa and the semi-arid Sahel. The focus of this research is how surface energy and water budgets respond to variations in rainfall and temperature. It asks the following questions: Where will warmer temperature pose a hazard to rainfed agriculture in the Sahel in the next 20 years? What environment and weather conditions led to above average surface temperature during the recent decade in east Africa? How have declines in rainfall since the 1980s impacted vegetation productivity and hydrology in Tanzania? The research incorporates a variety of earth observation data, including historical records from in situ, model-derived, and satellite-observed sources and projections from global climate models. A major contribution is the identification of specific areas, mainly in semi-arid climate zones, where increases in temperature and decreases to rainfall have large negative impacts on vegetation productivity. The research also presents new methods for evaluating land-atmosphere interactions in the context of hazards to vegetation. According to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, climate change will exacerbate current climate and non-climate stressors on agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa. This will adversely impact food security and the wellbeing of communities. Small-scale farmers grow more than 90 percent of the food produced in the region and many households depend on productive local growing conditions to support for their families. A better understanding of recent and near future climate constraints is important for identifying future food security risks and locally-appropriate adaptation strategies.",,,
548,"Remembering the Danube Swabians : The Haus der Donauschwaben as Catalyst in the Formation of an Inclusive Group Consciousness, 1945-1970","During this post-1945 phase, the group that would become known as the Danube Swabians employed various terms to identify themselves, while also having a separate terminology applied to them by the government of West Germany. These expellees did not develop a unitary group consciousness until the 1960s, when they set aside their post-Trianon identities in order to establish institutions that would preserve their cultural heritage. The first of these, the Haus der Donauschwaben in Sindelfingen, along with events such as the ""Tag der Donauschwaben"" and international fundraising efforts that encouraged a greater sense of cooperation between the separate groups catalyzed the development of a common identity. This identity remains firmly established today as the Danube Swabians continue to transfer their heritage to subsequent generations through a number of institutions. In analyzing the development of this collective consciousness, my dissertation restores the importance of self-perception among smaller displaced ethnic subgroups. In several waves during the eighteenth century about 150,000 German peasants embarked down the Danube River from Swabia to reclaim marshland recently reconquered from the Ottoman Turks by the Habsburg Monarchy. Nearly two centuries later their descendants fled and were expelled back into Austria and Germany in the aftermath of the Nazi occupation of that same region from 1941 to 1944. When they first arrived in Germany they self-identified as Yugoslavian-, Hungarian- and Romanian-Germans, according to the national states formed by the 1920 Treaty of Trianon governing the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. By 1967, however, they had adopted a unitary identity as Danube Swabians in their homeland of West Germany. This dissertation explores the evolution of this identity through four phases in an effort to understand how this group consciousness formed. The first phase began in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when ""Swabian"" settlers from various German principalities traveled down the Danube and settled in Habsburg lands as imperial subjects. The second phase occurred after the post-World War I collapse of Austria-Hungary when status as a national minority conferred political advantages in the successor states of Yugoslavia, Hungary and Romania during the interwar years. The third phase witnessed the widespread adoption of National Socialism and the interruption of this national development via the flight and expulsion of the ethnic German populations across eastern Europe as a result of the Second World War. The main focus of this study examines the fourth phase as these three post-Trianon ethnic German subgroups recovered from their reverse migration to the Federal Republic.",,,
549,Scalable Front End Designs for Communication and Learning,"In this work we provide three examples of estimation/detection problems, for which customizing the Front End to the specific application makes the system more efficient and scalable. The three problems we consider are all classical, but face new scalability challenges. This introduces additional constraints, accounting for which results in front end designs that are very distinct from the conventional approaches. The first two case studies pertain to the canonical problems of synchronization and equalization for communication links. As the system bandwidths scale, challenges arise due to the limiting resolution of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). We discuss system designs that react to this bottleneck by drastically relaxing the precision requirements of the front end and correspondingly modifying the back end algorithms using Bayesian principles. The third problem we discuss belongs to the field of computer vision. Inspired by the research in neuroscience about the mammalian visual system, we redesign the front end of a machine vision system to be neuro-mimetic, followed by layers of unsupervised learning using simple k-means clustering. This results in a framework that is intuitive, more computationally efficient compared to the approach of supervised deep networks, and amenable to the increasing availability of large amounts of unlabeled data. Finally, we explore alternative ways of learning convolutional nets for machine vision, making it easier to interpret and simpler to implement than currently used purely supervised nets. In particular, we investigate a framework that combines a neuro-mimetic front end (designed in collaboration with the neuroscientists from the psychology department at UCSB) together with unsupervised feature extraction based on clustering. Supervised classification, using a generic support vector machine (SVM), is applied at the end. We obtain competitive classification results on standard image databases, beating the state of the art for NORB (uniform-normalized) and approaching it for MNIST. Next, we take up the problem of channel equalization with severe limits on the number of slicers available for the ADC. We find that the standard flash ADC architecture can be highly sub-optimal in the presence of such constraints. Hence we explore a ''space-time'' generalization of the flash architecture by allowing a fixed number of slicers to be dispersed in time (sampling phase) as well as space (i.e., amplitude). We show that optimizing the slicer locations, conditioned on the channel, results in significant gains in the bit error rate (BER) performance. We first consider the problem of blind carrier phase and frequency synchronization in order to obtain insight into the performance limitations imposed by severe quantization constraints. We adopt a mixed signal analog front end that coarsely quantizes the phase and employs a digitally controlled feedback that applies a phase shift prior to the ADC, this acts as a controllable dither signal and aids in the estimation process. We propose a control policy for the feedback and show that combined with blind Bayesian algorithms, it results in excellent performance, close to that of an unquantized system.",,,
550,"Ecohydrologic Modeling in Three Western U.S. Mountain Watersheds : Implications of Climate, Soil, and Carbon Cycling Interactions for Streamflow","This dissertation explores ecohydrologic interactions in western U.S. catchments using a process-based model. My research focuses on understanding how model estimates of two key components of the hydrologic budget, evapotranspiration and streamflow, are influenced by soil and vegetation physiological characteristics in three watersheds. These watersheds are located in the Oregon Cascades, California Sierra Nevada, and Colorado Rocky Mountains. Water availability in these systems is driven on a first order by annual precipitation. The majority of their precipitation is received in the winter and their forests are generally water-limited in the summer. However, they differ in the magnitude of annual precipitation received, the fraction of winter precipitation received as snow, and their seasonal energy demands. The response of these ecosystems to inter-annual climate variation is also a function of soil storage and ecophysiological characteristics. I will present research motivated by three research questions. How do soil characteristics and climate interact to influence forest water availability? How do uncertainties in forest ecophysiology, carbon allocation strategy, and their interaction effect mature forest carbon and streamflow estimates? Finally, how do climate and carbon allocation strategy influence the rate of forest growth and streamflow recovery following disturbance? I use a physically-based model, the Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System, to address these questions. Results indicate that the influence of soil storage on evapotranspiration's sensitivity to climate drivers varies across sites. In the Sierra Nevada and Cascades, low soil storage increases the sensitivity of annual ET to climate drivers. Evapotranspiration in Colorado, which is water-limited but has a summer monsoonal pulse, is not sensitive to changes in soil storage. Estimates of forest carbon sequestration differ significantly between three carbon allocation strategies in mature (100-300) forests. Biomass estimates for leaf and fine root pools were strongly sensitive to allocation strategy and ecophysiological characteristics in the Sierra Nevada watershed. Streamflow estimates in this drier watershed are also more sensitive to vegetation ecophysiology. I show that the effect of allocation strategy effects estimates of recovery in forest LAI and streamflow more than climate variability at al three sites. This research contributes to the coupled ecosystem modeling community's understanding of key processes that influence our ability to predict water resources.",,,
552,Studies in Neoproterozoic Paleontology,"The first is a systematic study of the diverse and well-preserved, organic-walled microfossil assemblage of the Alinya Formation of eastern Officer Basin, Australia. The use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed an unexpected level of morphological detail not visible in transmitted light microscopy and led to the recognition of new species and emendation of existing species as well as establishment of degradational sequences. In total, thirty-three taxa are described here including nineteen previously named forms, five newly described species and two new combinations. The last of these three studies provides a broader view of the early to middle Neoproterozoic biosphere (1 Ga to 635 Ma) and describes application of the CONOP correlation and seriation algorithm to a new database of paleontological, geochemical and radiometric data. Paleobiological (first and last species appearances), geochemical and age events were placed into an ordinal sequence and calibrated to the geological time-scale to reveal a high-resolution species richness record for the first 80% of the Neoproterozoic Era. Major features of this record include an increase in species richness ~805 Ma, sustained high richness levels until a decrease ~770 Ma and a short-lived increase ~760 Ma before a steep decline ~750 Ma. The findings of the two studies described above can be placed within the context of this broader synthesis: the diverse assemblage of the Alinya Formation is representative of the richness peak between ~805 and 775 Ma and the successions recording the Sturtian glacial and interglacial assemblages in Australia and Svalbard are indicative of the extended nadir that began ~750 Ma with a recovery in species richness delayed until after the termination of the second (Marinoan) glacial event. These three studies, together, describe a broad view of the early to middle Neoproterozoic Era and detail important vignettes within that story. From a more detailed and temporally constrained record of the Neoproterozoic biosphere, relationships between biotic and abiotic events during this transformative time can become better understood. The second study describes the organic-walled microfossil assemblages from five successions that span the first (Sturtian) glaciation (~717 Ma) and interglacial interval (>635 Ma), and integrates those data with a critical evaluation of primary paleontological literature of units deposited from ~850 to 650 Ma. The described successions from Australia and Svalbard record low species richness throughout this interval and when placed in context of all available body fossil data from the mid-Neoproterozoic, indicate global species richness may have decreased much earlier than previously realized. This finding of temporal decoupling between loss of richness and glacial onset suggests the extinctions previously associated with the Snowball Earth glacial events may not have been glacially driven. The Neoproterozoic Era was one of major biotic change against a background marked by fluctuations in oceanic and atmospheric chemistry, formation and rifting of the supercontinent Rodinia, and at least two global glaciations (Snowball Earth events). Presented here are three studies of differing aspects of those biological changes.",,,
553,Wet Adhesion : The Advancement from Mussel Plaques to Applications,"To further investigate the adhesive proteins at the nanoscale and apply them to biologically relevant systems, the SFA was used to measure the interaction of collagen type-1 (COL1A1) to natural mussel foot protein-3 (mfp-3). COL1A1 is the most abundant protein in the human body and measuring the interactions of collagen to mfps will aid in the development of tunable adhesives for medical and dental applications. At low pH, COL1A1 increased the cohesive energy of interaction between unoxidized mfp-3 films. Oxidation of the mfp-3 films significantly decreased the cohesion -however, when COLA1 was injected between the mfp-3 films, the cohesion was recovered. Cohesion was achieved by COL1A1 bridging to the two mfp-3 oxidized protein films. Marine mussels use a mixture of proteins rich in 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) to adhere to surfaces underwater. This dissertation focuses on the marine mussel adhesive system which serves as an inspiration for the development of next generation wet adhesives. The mechanism of interaction of mussel foot proteins with different surfaces under biologically relevant wet conditions from macroscopic (mussel foot) to nanoscopic (peptides that make the mussel foot proteins) scales was investigated. Previous studies using the surface forces apparatus (SFA) have demonstrated that sticky proteins require an acidic environment to maintain adhesion to mineral surfaces. The mussel prevents oxidation of the critical amino acid dopa that is partially responsible for adhesion to mineral surfaces by lowering the local pH during plaque formation. A fluorescent tagged lipid bilayer on mica was developed to measure the local pH of the mussel's distal depression during plaque formation. Mussels tailor the local environment by lowering the pH in the range of 3.5 - 4.7 during the secretion of the adhesive proteins to the surface to limit the oxidation of dopa. A partial recombinant construct of mfp-1 (rmefp-1) and a short decapeptide dimer (mfp-1 pep dimer) with and without Dopa was assessed for their cohesive and adhesive properties to mica and silicone surface using the SFA. Results demonstrated at low pH (3.7), both the unmodified and Dopa-containing rmfp-1 show similar adhesion energy to mica and cohesion or self-interaction energy of Wc = 4.9 +/- 0.6 mJ/m2. Cohesion between two Dopa-containing rmfp-1 surfaces can be doubled by Fe 3+ chelation (Wc ~ 10 mJ/m2), but remains unchanged with unmodified rmfp-1.Our results demonstrate recombinant proteins that mimic mfps have cohesive and adhesive properties with and with metal chelation by Fe3+. Understanding the role of surface preparation, protein-surface interactions and protein length is very crucial in determining the performance of synthetic polymer based on marine inspired adhesion. The performance of strong adhesion is highly dependent on surface preparation and failure occurs from weak energetic interactions between the adhesive polymer and substrate interface. How marine mussels adhere to surfaces in natural conditions despite the harsh conditions present was studied. Confocal microscopy was used to observe the mussels distal depression during plaque formation to clean and fouled surfaces. Results demonstrated mussels do not clean surfaces coated with complex biofilms and gold films coated on silica surfaces.",,,
554,Analyzing and Processing Big Real Graphs,"In this dissertation, we tackle three important graph research problems caused by the significant differences of the big real graphs: efficient node distance computation, graph dynamic analysis and modeling, and graph privacy. First, we target on a fundamental graph analysis problem, i.e. node distance computation. As a primitive of graph analysis and network applications, the computation of shortest path or random walk distances is computationally expensive, and difficult to scale with the sheer size of big real graphs. To address the scalability issue, we design a novel node distance computation method, named graph coordinate systems, to efficiently estimate node distances with high accuracy. Finally, to address privacy issue in sharing graphs, we design a graph privacy system to guarantee the required level of privacy. The goal of our work is to design a system that can both maintain a meaningful graph structure and provide strong privacy guarantee. To navigate the tradeoff between the strength of privacy and graph structure utility, we propose a differentially-private graph model. Our rigorous proof shows that the graphs produced by the system can achieve the required level of privacy. By running the system on real graphs collected from Facebook, Internet, and Web, the results demonstrate that the generated synthetic graphs match the original graphs in terms of graph structural metrics and application-level performance. As fundamental abstractions of network structures, graphs are everywhere, ranging from biological protein interaction networks and Internet routing networks, to emerging online social networks. Studying graphs is critical to understanding the fundamental processes behind the networks, and of practical importance in experimental research. Although many studies on graphs have been carried out in decades, most of the work focused on small or synthetic graphs. In recent years, because of the unprecedented increase of existing networks and the emergence of new complex networks, more and more big real graphs are becoming available. Compared to the graphs studied in prior work, the graphs from these networks are significantly different in scale, level of dynamics and structure. Our second work is to understand and model the dynamic processes in big real graphs. Specifically, we propose methods to analyze graph dynamics at multiple network scales and explore temporal properties of network growth. Through measurements on Renren first two-year dynamic data, we find independent and predictable processes at different network levels, and detect self-similar properties in its edge creation process. Based on the observations, we propose a new dynamic graph model to capture both temporal and spatial properties. Calibrated with the Renren dataset, our model successfully produces synthetic graphs showing similar dynamic properties. In summary, to analyze and process the graphs from today's large complex networks, we work on three important problems, including efficiently computing node distances in massive graphs, analyzing and modeling high volume of dynamics in big real graphs, and protecting graph privacy in sharing graphs. We propose novel solutions to address these problems. Through our extensive experiments, we show that our designs perform consistently well on big real graphs.",,,
555,Index Estimates and Existence of Minimal Surfaces in Manifolds with Controlled Curvature,"If M is simply connected, then delta-controlled half-isotropic curvature implies that M is diffeomorphic to S n. In this case the constant curvature metric on Sn can be used to compute the low degree O(3)-equivariant cohomology of Map(S2, Sn). This then implies the existence of alpha-energy critical points of low index for generic metrics with delta-controlled half-isotropic curvature, when alpha is sufficiently close to one. Using index estimates to control the bad behavior of these critical points as alpha approaches 1 allows us to prove the existence of many minimal S2 of low index. When the compact manifold M has a Riemannian metric satisfying a suitable curvature condition, we show that it has many minimal two-spheres of index between n--2 and 2n--5, using Morse theory for the alpha-energy of Sacks and Uhlenbeck. The difficulty is controlling bad behavior of a sequence of alpha-energy critical points as alpha approaches one. The two bad behaviors which must be controlled are convergence toward a bubble tree and convergence to a branched cover of a minimal sphere of lower energy. We prevent these difficulties by making estimates on the index of bubble trees and branched covers. These estimates require a new curvature condition, delta-controlled half-isotropic curvature. In order to better understand this new condition, we study the relationship between metrics with delta-controlled half-isotropic curvature and metrics satisfying the better studied conditions of pinched sectional curvature and pinched flag curvature. We are able to get a basically complete picture of the relationship between these three conditions.",,,
556,Stochastic Filtering Problem with Financial Application to High Frequency Trading,"In HFT problem, we model a price impact function consisting of midprice and trade intensity where midprice is driven by market orders (marked point process) and information flow (an independent wiener process). Moreover, we define a value function to optimize the expected price impact function at an optimal stopping time within a fixed period of time. This is essentially the optimal stopping time (OST) problem. Under our problem formulation, the trade intensity is only partially observed through market orders. Hence, we conduct the conditional distribution of the trading intensity process using stochastic particle filtering (SPF) method. In addition, we propose an integrated Advanced Rao-Blackwell (ARB) algorithm to improve the current SPF algorithms. With ARB, we can filter the posterior distribution of trade intensity under the information filtration. In order to optimize the value function, we use this posterior filter for intensity and apply Snell envelope and dynamic programming principle to discretize the time for the objective function. Last, we employ Least-Square Monte Carlo to approximate the conditional expectation of the price impact function so we can resolve the OST problem. We consider a stochastic filtering problem for a partially observed modulated Hawkes process with an application to the High Frequency Trading (HFT) Problem. In this thesis, HFT problem is emphasized on the optimization with the price impact. The modulated Hawkes process consists three parts: marked point process, intensity process and baseline process where intensity process is driven by. We model the marked point process as the incoming of market orders and intensity as trade fill rate. In addition, we propose the trade intensity with different base states defined as the baseline process under the Hawkes process setting.",,,
557,Individual and Strategy Differences in Allocentric-Heading Recall and its Neural Basis,"Sensing directionality is the ability to code and compare allocentric-headings, which are facing directions that are grounded in the environment, and the ability to sense directionality is essential for supporting environmental-scale spatial abilities. For example, it is difficult to point accurately towards an unseen landmark without knowing your facing direction relative to the environment, and it is your ability to sense directionality that keeps you oriented within environmental-scale spaces. To investigate the correlates of individual differences in sensing directionality, two tasks were used: the Allocentric-Heading Recall task, which involves comparing one's physical facing direction with the facing direction of a photograph (in Experiments 1-3), and the Relative Heading task, which involves comparing an imagined facing direction with a facing direction of a photograph (in Experiments 4-6). Individuals vary greatly in their environmental-scale spatial abilities, such as their ability to point to unseen locations, and find their way through an unfamiliar neighborhood. However, causes of these individual differences are currently unclear. Therefore, in this dissertation, I have proposed that in order to understand the causes (and correlates) of individual differences in environmental-scale spatial abilities, individual differences in the processes that underlie these abilities must be fully understood. To demonstrate how this method provides insight into the individual differences in environmental-scale spatial abilities, six experiments were used to identify the correlates of individual differences in sensing directionality. In Experiment 1, the Allocentric-Heading Recall task was completed using a chair- turn response and accuracy rates showed an alignment effect. In Experiments 2 and 3, a strategy questionnaire was added to determine the impact of how the individual conceptualized the facing directions on task performance. Individuals who tended to use an allocentric strategy outperformed those who tended to use an egocentric strategy. In Experiments 4 and 5, the Relative Heading task was used to determine whether removing body orientation from the Allocentric-Heading task would reduce the alignment effect. In fact, removing body orientation eliminated the alignment effect, suggesting that the alignment effect found in the Allocentric-Heading Recall task was a sensorimotor alignment effect. In Experiment 6, the Relative Heading task was conducted inside an MRI scanner. This experiment found that task performance was related to caudate volume, and environmental-scale spatial abilities was related to activity patterns in the left superior parietal lobule. These experiments revealed that the ability to sense directionality depends on three factors: how the individual conceptualizes his/her environment, body orientation, and brain differences. This dissertation provides evidence that variation in sensing directionality depends on multiple factors; therefore, it is likely that variation in other processes that underlie environmental-scale spatial abilities also depend on multiple factors. In order to understand variation in environmental-scale spatial abilities, it is essential not only to identify the underlying processes that support environmental-scale spatial abilities, but to also identify the causes of variation in those underlying processes.",,,
558,Freedom and Impermanence : Recovering the Liberal Ideal from the Metaphysics of Modernity,"Following this historical and philosophical study of the phenomenology of freedom, encompassing in division one a study of the structure of the idea of freedom in liberal thought and in division two a consideration of its effects in recent histories of international relations, division two thereafter concludes with an alternative conceptualization of freedom inspired by a thorough-going ethical embrace of impermanence as a linchpin in a fundamental and ontological notion of being-in-the-world. A newly-enriched and imaginative liberalism offers a possibility for an ethical ground for politics organized for the greatest freedom of each person in a complex age. The onslaught of technological rationality has resulted in an enframed world of power underscored by the ubiquitous manipulation of technique and gesture, leaving the human-animal at the mercy of thoughtlessness in the service of technologically-manufactured permanences now merged with being. This complexity has become an illusory end-in-itself, obscuring our collective and individual experiences of being, and the contingency, and impermanence, of being. As such, we must, as beings whose existences are at issue, determine, through critical rethinking, how political thought should proceed in freeing beings for the possibility of evolution, survival, and the ongoing practice, of being free. Liberalism, the political philosophy created in the name of freedom, has, because of its complicity with structures of power organized for the production of permanence, in the history of the modern west, been transformed into an ideological template for the rationalization of moralized power politics, thus abrogating prior fundamental commitments to the freedom of humanity. From ancient to contemporary, with a special focus on the middle-modern milieu, this project traces through western concepts of liberty and their connection to structures of power and authority, both within the west and beyond it, as well, for example through the use of liberty as the handmaiden of power politics in the sphere of international relations and the politics of economic development.",,,
559,Identification of Two Novel Functions of Syntaxin-3,"The canonical function of the SNARE family of proteins is to facilitate membrane fusion events within the cell. Syntaxins are a conserved member of this family. They mediate the exocytosis of neurotransmitters, the fusion of vesicles to endocytic compartments, are required for the establishment and maintenance of polarity, and are needed for the final abscission step of cytokinesis. This study adds two novel functions for syntaxin-3 (Stx3). First, we show that via a cleavage event or by alternative splicing, a soluble version lacking the transmembrane domain (Stx3S) acts as a transcriptional regulator. Observing Stx3S localize to the nucleus, binding to multiple transcription factors, and confirming microarray data on cells that have Stx3S silenced demonstrates this finding. Combined with evidence that there are other soluble syntaxins that localize to the nucleus, this may be a new and surprising signaling pathway with wide implications. Second, we show that Stx3 is ubiquitinated in the polybasic juxtamembrane region causing Stx3 to be trafficked to the endosomal pathway and subsequently released as exosomes. This provides a mechanism of previously published data showing Stx3 localizes to endocytic compartments and being present in apically released exosomes. When the ubiquitination event is prevented, less of the exosome cargo protein GPRC5B is found in exosomes. We hypothesize that the novel ubiquitin binding ability of Stx3 plays a role in sorting cargo to exosomes. Together, this study introduces two disparate, unexpected functions for a protein that has an established function.",,,
560,Probabilistic Graphical Models for Contour Tracking and Segmentation in Electron Microscopy Images,"Neural circuitry reconstruction is a central problem in neuroscience and the focus of the field of connectomics, where automatic high-throughput techniques are essential since human analysis is labor intensive and impractical, due to the size of the image volume. This dissertation presents three probabilistic graphical model-based methods for solving the problem of reconstructing the 3D model of neuronal cells in electron microscopy images, where different modeling approaches, optimization algorithms, and feature selections are utilized. In the first part, a 1D hidden Markov model-based contour tracking algorithm is proposed for tracing a single or a few neuronal processes which may have undergone arbitrary deformation, displacement, and topological changes. In this method, uncertain segments with lower likelihoods are detected, and then a few hypothetical arcs are created to perform contour refinement to enable the discovery and corresponding tracing of topology changes. Secondly, an agglomerative framework for grouping superpixels, using a hyper-graph, is proposed as a scalable framework for simultaneously tracing of a large number of cells. Lastly, a two-dimensional hidden Markov model is trained and employed for tracing a large number of cells, by modeling the problem as a pixel labeling task. This method leverages the concept of spatially adaptive states, wherein the state-space at each pixel is locally restricted to be a subset of the full state-space. This local adaptation of states, not only reduces the computational complexity significantly, but also improves the segmentation accuracy. While the first contour tracking algorithm precisely locates cell boundaries, the second hyper-graph-based framework and the third pixel-labeling-based algorithm easily scale to hundreds of cells, and hence represent three complementary techniques that together offer significant advancement on the roblem of 3D reconstruction of neuronal cells.",,,
561,Computational studies of sequence-specific driving forces in peptide self-assembly,"Peptides are biopolymers made from various sequences of twenty different types of amino acids, connected by peptide bonds. There are practically an infinite number of possible sequences and tremendous possible combinations of peptide-peptide interactions. Recently, an increasing number of studies have shown a stark variety of peptide self-assembled nanomaterials whose detailed structures depend on their sequences and environmental factors; these have end uses in medical and bio-electronic applications, for example. To understand the underlying physics of complex peptide self-assembly processes and to delineate sequence specific effects, in this study, I use various simulation tools spanning all-atom molecular dynamics to simple lattice models and quantify the balance of interactions in the peptide self-assembly processes. In contrast to the existing view that peptides' aggregation propensities are proportional to the net sequence hydrophobicity and inversely proportional to the net charge, I show the more nuanced effects of electrostatic interactions, including the cooperative effects between hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Notably, I suggest rather unexpected, yet important roles of entropies in the small scale oligomerization processes. Overall, this study broadens our understanding of the role of thermodynamic driving forces in peptide self-assembly.",,,
562,The Devil in the Brazilian Backlands,"Conselheiro's followers were victims of the fanaticism of their leader and of the extreme forces of the Brazilian military which resulted in the decimation of Canudos and the death of over ten thousand people. By drawing an argument based on Euclides da Cunha's observation of events in his field notes, newspaper articles, and in Os Sertoes, this study defends that Canudos was not the idealized community portrayed by many, but was instead a place under the theocracy of a fanatic leader. The last section of this dissertation frames Conselheiro's dominance of his subjects in Foucault's theory of the povouir pastoral (pastoral power of the priest). This study aims to contribute to the body of research on Canudos to an English speaking audience. This study starts by presenting the religious background of the sertanejos, their mysticism and their oral tradition, which includes tales about the return of D. Sebastiao and myths rooted in the European tradition. It then analyses the teachings of Conselheiro and the importance placed on the role of the Devil as a threat to losing one's soul forever. This dissertation explores representations of the Devil in the narrative of Canudos through the lenses of Euclides da Cunha's classic Os Sertoes (1902), the second manuscript of Antonio Conselheiro (1897), and the religious guidebook Missao Abreviada (1859). To understand the motivations of the Brazilian backlanders (sertanejos ) to engage in the Battle of Canudos (1896-1897), one has to consider the role of the Devil in this battle. Conselheiro's followers believed that the apocalypse was approaching and that they were fighting the demoniacal forces of the republicans in order to save their souls.",,,
563,Novel Protein Regulators of Cytokinesis and Drug-Induced Behavioral Plasticity,"This dissertation comprises work conducted on two distinct projects. The first project addresses the process of mammalian cell cytokinesis, a sequence of events near the end of mitosis that separates the contents of a dividing cell into two daughter cells. During cytokinesis, a cellular structure known as the midbody forms between the two sets of anaphase chromosomes and coordinates chromosome separation, membrane trafficking, and microtubule disassembly to ensure proper abscission. Although the midbody was first observed over a hundred years ago, hundreds of proteins are required for its function in abscission, and many molecular details of this process remain to be understood. Chapter II and III present evidence that at least two subunits of the nuclear histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase (H3K4MT) complex, WDR5 and MLL3, unexpectedly reside at the midbody, associate with several midbody proteins, and regulate cytokinesis. WDR5 localization at the midbody, but not the nucleus, requires the integrity of its central arginine-binding cavity, and several truncations of WDR5 exhibit selective enrichment at the midbody, but not within the nucleus. Additionally, two novel WDR5 and MLL3 associated proteins, KIF2A and SAF-A, respectively, are identified. These data represent the first known involvement of a nuclear H3K4MT subunit in abscission. The second project (Chapter IV) implicates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as a key player in the expression of reward-related behavior in a mouse model of substance abuse. Systemic administration of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin greatly reduces mTOR activity in two addiction-related brain regions, the prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum. Furthermore, while rapamycin has little effect on the learning of a conditioned place preference, it attenuates the expression of this preference during exposure to drug cues, and also blocks psychostimulant-induced locomotor sensitization after a period of drug withdrawal. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that mTOR regulates the expression of reward behavior upon reactivation of a memory by environmental cues.",,,
564,Masculinities in the Ancient Greek Novels,"This doctoral thesis investigates masculinity in the five major Greek novels: Chariton's Callirhoe, Xenophon of Ephesus's Anthia and Habrocomes, Longus's Daphnis and Chloe, Achilles Tatius's Leucippe and Clitophon, and Heliodorus's Aethiopica. I argue that the novels are symptomatic of the periods in which they were produced, and that they express contemporary cultural concerns regarding masculinity. My study approach masculinity as a concept revealed less through conscious self-representation than influences and conventions. I examine masculinity in the novels by focusing on the social processes and institutions by which male characters must establish, defend, and express their (culturally normative and elite) masculinity. The individual chapters---on friendship, violence, and self-transformation---show how the novels represent masculinity not only as an achievement (rather than a given), but also as an identity to be expressed and recognized through the characterization, actions, and relationships of the male characters. This thesis contributes uniquely to the ongoing discussion on masculinity in the Greek novels and, more generally, in the Imperial period in its investigation that goes beyond explicit references to gendered behavior and occupations to examine the actions and relationships of the novels' male characters that expose the conventions by which elite masculinity must be recognized.",,,
565,The isolation and post-assembly modification of acyl peptidic siderophores,"Acyl peptidic siderophores are produced by a variety of bacteria and are often produced in a suite where the iron(III)-binding headgroup remains constant while the fatty acid appendage varies by length and functionality. The inclusion of a fatty acid tail is clearly advantageous for some siderophores, such as the mycobactins, whose amphiphilic properties allow the siderophore to freely diffuse between membranes and media for iron acquisition from macrophages; however, for the majority of acyl siderophores, the biological significance of the fatty acid tail has yet to be determined. This work is focused on the production and post-assembly modification of acyl siderophores. The ubiquitous marine hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium, Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2, was determined to produce the amphibactins, which have been isolated from multiple oil-associating marine bacteria. Only longer tailed amphibactins (C16 and C18) were isolated from the cell pellet of A. borkumensis SK2 following centrifugation, as identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Putative biosynthetic genes for amphibactin biosynthesis were also evaluated in the genome of A. borkumensis SK2. The marine bacteria Marinobacter sp. DS40M6 and Marinobacter nanhaiticus D15-8W produce a suite of acyl peptidic marinobactin siderophores to acquire iron under iron-limiting conditions. During late-log phase growth, the marinobactins are hydrolyzed to form the marinobactin headgroup with release of the corresponding fatty acid tail. The bntA gene, a homologue of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa pyoverdine acylase gene, pvdQ, was identified from Marinobacter sp. DS40M6. A bntA knockout mutant of Marinobacter sp. DS40M6 produced the suite of acyl marinobactins A-E, without the usual formation of the marinobactin headgroup. Another marinobactin-producing species, Marinobacter nanhaiticus D15-8W, is predicted to have two pvdQ homologues, mhtA and mhtB. MhtA catalyzes hydrolysis of the apo-marinobactin siderophores, as well as, the quorum sensing signaling molecule, dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone. In contrast to hydrolysis of the suite of apo-marinobactins by MhtA, hydrolysis of the iron(III)-bound marinobactins was not observed. The post-assembly modification of another acyl siderophore is seen with the amphi-enterobactins produced by Vibrio harveyi BAA-1116. A dimer of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-L-Ser is found in the cell-free supernatant of V. harveyi BAA-1116 following centrifugation. V. harveyi BAA-1116 does not possess biosynthetic genes for 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-L-Ser, suggesting the dimer is formed as a hydrolysis product of the amphi-enterobactins. Adding Fe(III)-amphi-enterobactins to crude cell-free extracts of V. harveyi BAA-1116 results in dimer formation; however, dimer formation is not seen when the apo-amphi-enterobactins are incubated with cell-free extracts, suggesting this could be a mechanism for iron release and siderophore recycling.",,,
566,Education & the tumult of globalization : Considering political risk management for international education in an era of globalization,"In the current era of globalization, the world has experienced unprecedented changes compared to any era of human experience. It is in these changes that operating in the world has become an increasingly complex phenomena dictated by transnational processes. And, it is in these processes that there are a myriad of complexities, and moreover a plethora of risks. Attempts at navigating such risks due to globalization have therefore prompted the expansion of the risk management industry on a global scale as many such risks can be explicitly understood to be as a consequence of globalization and global geopolitical behavior. Many of these practices have focused on issues concerning economic globalization and global business. However this project seeks to argue that with the expansion of international education and increased popularity in study abroad programming in the current era of globalization, there is an equally expanding market and growing demand for political risk management services for educational institutions. Moreover that risk management products and services could be better tailored for international educational and study abroad programming. This will be substantiated by looking at the case study of the University of California Education Abroad Program, and their risk management system's response to political risks faced by their program in Egypt. This project concludes by explicitly comparing risk management for education with other sectors, and ultimately offers measures of recommendation to improve such services for international education programming.",,,
567,If These Walls Could Talk : A Global Ethnography of Sea Change,"My doctoral dissertation examines how rising seas and a recently renewed interest in the construction of seawalls illustrate a form of development that involves substantial labor, financing, and materials in addition to hidden social and environmental costs. More generally, the research looks at the moving borders of the sea driven by the complex dynamics of anthropogenic climate change in which twenty-five million to one billion people will be affected by the year 2050. I draw upon theoretical approaches that consider climate-related issues to be macro-social processes involving global and international relations as well as matters of lived experience involving people in contexts where material and cultural histories shape climate change resiliency. Using the methods of global ethnography, I address the problem of coastal vulnerability by focusing on the cultural and social dynamics of coastal development and sea change in Guyana, The Maldives, Venice and the Netherlands, highlighting issues that emerge in places where seawalls are already important fixtures in the landscape. Analysis across these sites reveals how the threat of rising seas involves multiple axes of inequality formed within the contexts of colonialism, development, and globalization over the past one hundred years. Seawalls and other coastal structures embody culturally ingrained meanings, physical demands, and financial investments that continue to shape the experiences of those who live behind them. Data was gathered from April 2012 to April 2014 in Venice, the Netherlands, Guyana and the Maldives, and included sixty-two semi-structured interviews and nine focus groups, touching upon the lived experiences of 120 people. Findings illustrate the tensions and contradictions that ground seawall development. In Guyana, sand bags and rip-rap structures line the coast in contrast to the state of the art concrete barriers found in Venice, the Netherlands, and the United States. Poor coastal villages have few options as they invest time and hope in the restoration of mangroves forests, a process that has been met with many obstacles and unexpected sacrifices. In the Maldives, one-third of the population lives on a walled island without beaches, while tourists enjoy holidays on over two hundred island resorts nearby. As seawalls become measures of last resort in the struggle to hold the line, the existing narratives of the ""sinking island"" and ""climate change refugee"" fail to capture the dynamic inequalities that exist within and between places. This study shows the need to offer different conceptualizations of rising seas in public discourses, based on an analysis of seawalls and what the people who live in and around them say as they speak out.",,,
568,Insights into the Rational Design of Multi-Functional Fullerene Systems for Application in Blended Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells,"Elucidating the structure-function relationships of organic semiconductors has been central to the advancement of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In particular, enhancing the performance of p-type materials in disordered heterojunctions is broadly acknowledged as the principal factor leading to current trends of improved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). However, two additional factors are crucially important for the next step forward in improving PCEs. First, investigating the influence, design and synthesis of new n-type materials, specifically fullerene acceptors, is of high importance. Second, because fullerene performance is often compromised by the morphological disorder of bulk heterojunctions, developing fullerenes systems that retain fidelity within disordered blends is also of broad interest. In light of these challenges, the field has witnessed a notable shift towards developing a comprehensive understanding of the design rules needed to advance the performance of fullerene acceptors in bulk heterojunctions. This work spotlights two multi-functional fullerene systems designed for blended heterojunctions. First, the synthesis of several novel fullerene-dye adducts with enhanced photon absorption will be presented. The ability of these adducts to absorb visible light in their pure state was evaluated and systematically examined versus their capacity to complement the absorption of low band gap donors and mediate charge transport in bulk heterojunctions. Second, mixed fullerene ternary blends were introduced as a strategy to stabilize the morphology in bulk heterojunctions and prolong operational lifetimes of OPV devices. Combined, these two systems offer unique insight into the rational design of fullerenes for their application in blended systems.",,,
569,"Hierarchical Order in Organic Photovoltaic Thin Films : Effects of Miscibility and Crystallization in 1-, 2-, and 3-Component Heterojunctions","Organic electronic materials hold promise to revolutionize the manner in which low-cost, lightweight, and mechanically flexible optoelectronic thin film devices are fabricated and utilized. These materials have received explosive research interest in the past decade for their rich science as complex soft matter blends and for their potential in realizing efficient, solution-processable photovoltaic devices. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs), most typically comprised of an electron-donating conjugated polymer and an electron-accepting fullerene-based molecular species, heavily rely on structural order on molecular, nanoscopic, and mesoscopic length scales in order for charge carriers to be efficiently extracted from the device under illumination. In general, following photon absorption, the resulting exciton may produce free holes (electrons) within the donor (acceptor) phase, as long as the excitation is within its diffusion distance of the donor-acceptor interface. Secondly, once free charges are formed following excitonic splitting, they must be efficiently transported to the electrodes for collection. This process adds another structural requirement; the domains must be large enough for transport within and between them, and the coherence of the domains and structural order of crystallites within domains both become relevant. Due to the complex, highly mixed nature of these blends, the second segment will focus on work that investigates the structural evolution of an all-polymer formulation developed for generating controlled order in OPV films. An all-conjugated diblock copolymer, P3HT-b-DPPT-T, will be structurally described in the bulk, solution, and thin film states. Thin films were deposited from solution and thermally annealed in the rubbery and melt states. Synchrotron X-ray characterization probes were then used to study the structural order at both crystallite and domain length scales in order to evaluate the ability to form ordered bulk heterojunctions (BHJs). Using GIWAXS and DSC-WAXS, the crystalline order of each block is probed. Both blocks are semicrystalline and form edge-on textured crystallites in the thin film state. Interestingly, as characterized by GISAXS, AFM, and resonant soft X-ray spectroscopic scattering, this crystallization behavior leads to fibril formation that in turn dominates the mesoscale domain ordering. Additionally, it is shown that this fibril formation, although tunable by thermal annealing, has its origins in the solution state, as probed by solution-SAXS. Annealing within the P3HT melt and slow cooling allows for highly ordered BHJ films, where the fibrils formed by crystallites of each block are aligned in lamellar arrays, with a domain spacing of ~50 nm. Such a structure is extremely advantageous for OPVs, and the implications of further design of block chemistry and fullerene compatibility with each segment for generating highly ordered, efficient ternary OPVs will be discussed. In this work, these structural details are explored in two OPV formulations and related to thin film fabrication and processing methodologies. Specific emphasis is placed on the interplay of miscibility of components and their crystallization behavior. In early work exploring the concept of donor-acceptor mixing in polymer-fullerene blends, new understanding was developed regarding their miscibility, and it was shown that the idea of pure donor and acceptor domains in polymer-fullerene (P3HT:PC61BM) blends is unrealistic. In an extension, a secondary donor, light-absorbing polymer, PDPP2FT, was added to a blend of P3HT and PC61BM. Using dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry (DSIMS) bilayer diffusion experiments and grazing incidence wide and small angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS and GISAXS) investigations of thin film blends, this work highlights that the miscibility of the fullerene with each donor polymer is critical for understanding the distribution of acceptor components within donor-rich domains in ternary OPV blends. The performance of compositionally controlled devices is reconciled based on the described microstructure studies.",,,
570,Resonance Enhanced Multi-photon Spectroscopy of DNA,"Resonant IR multiphoton dissociation spectroscopy in conjunction with molecular mechanics and DFT calculations are used to determine gas phase structures of anionic nucleotide clusters. A comparison of the identified structures with known biological function shows how the hydrogen bonding of the nucleotides and their clusters free of solvent create favorable structures for quick incorporation into enzymes such as DNA polymerase. For over 50 years DNA has been studied to better understand its connection to life and evolution. These past experiments have led to our understanding of its structure and function in the biological environment but the interaction of DNA with UV radiation at the molecular level is still not very well understood. Unique mechanisms in nucleobase chromaphores protect us from adverse chemical reactions after UV absorption. Studying these processes can help develop theories for prebiotic chemistry and the possibility of alternative forms of DNA. Using resonance enhanced multi-photon spectroscopic techniques in the gas phase allow for the structure and dynamics of individual nucleobases to be studied in detail. Experiments studying different levels of structure/complexity with relation to their biological function are presented. Due to the high specificity and sensitivity of resonant two photon ionization coupled with molecular beam mass spectrometry a new analytical technique for identifying molecular markers in archaeological vessels is presented. The xanthine alkaloids theobromine, theophylline and caffeine are identified in Central American and North American pottery sherds by direct desorption/resonant laser ionization mass spectrometry. Resonance enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI) spectroscopy techniques such as resonant two photon ionization (R2PI) and IR-UV double resonance are used to further elucidate the structure and excited state dynamics of the bare nucleobases thymine and uracil. Both exhibit long lived excited electronic states that have been implicated in DNA photolesions which can ultimately lead to melanoma and carcinoma. Our experimental data in comparison with many quantum chemical calculations suggest a new picture for the dynamics of thymine and uracil in the gas phase. A high probability of UV absorption from a vibrationally hot ground state to the excited electronic state shows that the stability of thymine and uracil comes from its intrinsic molecular properties and possibly a hydrogen bonding solvent capable of dissipating excess vibrational energy.",,,
571,Automatic Detection and Repair of Input Validation and Sanitization Bugs,"We experimented with a number of real world web applications and found many bugs and vulnerabilities. Our analysis generates counter-example behaviors demonstrating the detected bugs and vulnerabilities to help the developers with the debugging process. Moreover, we automatically generate patches that can be used to mitigate the detected bugs and vulnerabilities until developers write their own patches. We developed two basic approaches to bug detection and repair: 1) policy-based, and 2) differential. In the policy-based approach, input validation and sanitization policies are expressed using two regular expressions, one specifying the maximum policy (the upper bound for the set of strings that should be allowed) and the other specifying the minimum policy (the lower bound for the set of strings that should be allowed). Using our string analysis techniques we can identify two types of errors in an input validation and sanitization function: 1) it accepts a set of strings that is not permitted by the maximum policy (i.e., it is under-constrained), or 2) it rejects a set of strings that is permitted by the minimum policy (i.e., it is over-constrained). Our differential bug detection and repair approach does not require any policy specifications. It exploits the fact that, in web applications, developers typically perform redundant input validation and sanitization in both the client and the server-side since client-side checks can be by-passed. Using automata-based string analysis, we compare the input validation and sanitization functions extracted from the client- and server-side code, and identify and report the inconsistencies between them. Finally, we present an automated differential repair technique that can repair client and server-side code with respect to each other, or across applications in order to strengthen the validation and sanitization checks. Given a reference and a target function, our differential repair technique strengthens the validation and sanitization operations in the target function based on the reference function by automatically generating a set of patches. A crucial problem in developing dependable web applications is the correctness of the input validation and sanitization. Bugs in string manipulation operations used for validation and sanitization are common, resulting in erroneous application behavior and vulnerabilities that are exploitable by malicious users. In this dissertation, we investigate the problem of automatic detection and repair of validation and sanitization bugs both at the client-side (JavaScript) and the server-side (PHP or Java) code. We first present a formal model for input validation and sanitization functions along with a new domain specific intermediate language to represent them. Then, we show how to extract input validation and sanitization functions in our intermediate language from both client and server-side code in web applications. After the extraction phase, we use automata-based static string-analysis techniques to automatically verify and fix the extracted functions. One of our contributions is the development of efficient automata-based string analysis techniques for frequently used, complex string operations.",,,
572,The Black Hole Firewall and Top-Down Constructions of AdS/CFT,"In the first part of this dissertation we argue that the following statements cannot be all true: (i) Black hole formation and evaporation is a unitary process as viewed by external observers, (ii) Physics outside some microscopic distance away from the event horizon is described by local effective quantum field theory, (iii) A black hole is a quantum system with a finite number of states given by the exponential of the Bekenstein Hawking entropy, and (iv) An infalling observer's experience in the vicinity of the horizon is well described by local effective quantum field theory in the infalling reference frame. We argue that the most conservative resolution is that an infalling observer will see drastic violations of effective field theory far away from the singularity, and encounter high energy quanta, a firewall, just behind the black hole event horizon. We address counter proposals to the firewall which involve, in one way or another, radical modifications of quantum mechanics or locality, and argue that they are unsatisfactory in their current formulation. We conclude this part with an investigation into the existence of firewalls in the two dimensional Einstein-dilaton gravity model of CGHS. We find that black holes in such models do not develop firewalls, but rather evaporate down to form small mass remnants. We elaborate on why this is inevitable in two dimensions and argue against a similar conclusion in higher dimensions. In the second part of this dissertation we construct AdS2 and AdS3 magnetic brane solutions within the abelian truncations of AdS4 x orbifolded S7 and AdS5 x S5 supergravity. We find a class of supersymmetric solutions of the bulk theory to assure stability. We perform a preliminary analysis demonstrating the stability of some nonsupersymmetric embeddings. We identify the dual field theory and compare the thermal entropies across the duality. We end with an investigatation into the effects of backreaction on holography in AdS2. We study a classically solvable toy model that contains an IR AdS2 throat, and find that backreaction behaves as a strongly relevant perturbation deep in the AdS2 region.",,,
573,"Monsters of Late Capitalism Along the U.S.-Mexico Border: Legends, Epistemologies, and the Politics of Imagination","This dissertation explores how the battle for survival along the border is performed in the terrains of the fantastic and the uncanny, and where the real and the imaginary are not always clearly defined but deeply shaped by the socio-political and racial tensions of the region. In particular, it analyzes how these legends and popular saints are never random nor naive, but rather they are sophisticated ""in-context"" social productions assembled and adapted to respond to specific socio-political and racial-economic transnational realities. This project shows how folklore and pop-culture are useful tools to reconstruct the history of violence along the border and to understand the coping mechanisms developed by Latina/o border communities. The second chapter traces the apparition of El Chupacabras (1994), or goatsucker within the the context of anti-American sentiments in Puerto Rico, the fears and the anxieties of the U.S. post-cold war years, as well as the dismantling of the welfare state. In particular, it analyzes the Chupacabras as a subversive image, used to unify and address the struggles of small farmers and create a sophisticated polysemic metaphor to illustrate the insatiable appetite and predatory practices of neo-liberalism as implemented by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) during the 1990s. The third chapter continues with the study of Juan Soldado (1930s), one of the saints of undocumented border crossers, within the context of the border transformations created by American Prohibition (1920-1933), the Great Depression (1930s), and the mass ""deportation"" of Mexican-Americans and Mexican nationals (1929-1939). This research situates Juan Soldado's conviction for the rape and murder of an eight years old girl, and the subsequent Tijuana riots surrounding this case, as a pivotal event in the long tradition of femicides along the border. I analyze (a) the myth of the Devil along the border, (b) the Chupacabras, the livestock blood-sucking monster; and (c) the legend of Juan Soldado, a saint of undocumented border crossers. These three entities are used in order to create a genealogy of the effects of capitalism in the region, as each of them correlates to crucial periods of U.S.-Mexico relations. The first chapter begins by studying the legend of El Diablo (the Devil) along the U.S.-Mexico Border, in particular as it is narrated in the novel The Devil in Texas/El Diablo en Texas (1976) by Aristeo Brito. It explores the devil within the context of exploitative capitalism in the region and highlights the interconnection between the events of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), the effects of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo (1848), and the emergence of the modern Chicana/o Movement (1960-1970s). My dissertation examines the U.S.-Mexico border during the 20th century, not only as a socio-political space of conflict and struggle, but simultaneously as a 2,000-mile strip of ""haunted"" land, inhabited by many imaginary creatures, fantastic tales, monsters, and popular saints. It is through an examination of government proceedings, archival documents, religious artifacts, interviews, and ethnographic visits to border shrines and festival celebrations, that this research engages with the question of how communities utilize the fantastic and the uncanny to disseminate knowledge and inscribe history.",,,
574,Building Community? Analyzing Gated Housing Compounds in Bahrain,"The findings illuminate how compound residents perceive their environments at various scales, underscore the variegated impacts of compound living on place attachment, sense of community, and social networks, and highlight how mobility (within and beyond Bahrain) influences these social dimensions of compound living. Finally, challenging notions that residential segregation necessarily limits social interactions, I contend that segregation is not as absolute as it may initially seem; the formation of social ties across compound walls illustrates how the built environment influences the social environments of compound residents, but does not determine them. As residential segregation engenders complex and multifaceted social effects, the findings bring into relief the ways in which various social, cultural, and demographic factors interact with the built environment to shape residents' experiences. This dissertation foregrounds social processes in concert with urban phenomena and contributes to understandings of urban and social dynamics in the Gulf city at a time when the Gulf states have become important global focal points for processes of urbanization and labor migration. Rapid and radical socioeconomic transformations have accompanied the development of the hydrocarbon-exporting economies of the Arab Gulf states. The six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states are some of the largest recipients of labor migrants in the world, and the region has the second highest rate of urbanization in the world. Given these changes, it is critical to understand the urban impacts of migration flows that have dramatically increased the proportion of foreigners in the cities of the Gulf. This dissertation examines the urban and social geographies associated with gated housing compounds (developments geared toward white collar expatriate workers) in Bahrain. I investigate how associated productions of urban space and social processes of community formation of compound residents relate to and influence one another. My analysis is based on interviews with expatriates living in compounds and other residential accommodations. I also interviewed academics, planners, and landlords, and conducted surveys, participant observation, archival research, and field surveys. I focused on the experiences of compound residents and the ways in which the built environment influenced these experiences.",,,
575,Data Learning Methodologies for Improving the Efficiency of Constrained Random Verification,"In constrained random verification, when a simulation run of tests instantiated by a test template cannot reach the coverage goal, there are two possible reasons: insufficient simulation, and improper constraints and/or biases. There are three actions that a verification engineer can usually do to address the problem: to simulate more tests, to refine the test template, or to change to a new test template. Accordingly, we propose three data learning methodologies to help the engineers make more informed decisions in these three application scenarios and thus improve the verification efficiency. The first methodology identifies important (""novel"") tests before simulation based on what have been already simulated. By only simulating those novel tests and filtering out redundant tests, tremendous resources such as simulation cycles and licenses can be saved. The second methodology extracts the unique properties from those novel tests identified in simulation and uses them to refine the test template. By leveraging the extracted knowledge, more tests similar to the novel ones are generated. And thus the new tests are more likely to activate coverage events that are otherwise difficult to hit by extensive simulation. The third methodology analyses a collection of existing test items (test templates) and identifies feasible augmentation to the test plan. By automatically adding new test items based on the data analysis, it alleviates the manual efforts for closing coverage holes. The proposed data learning methodologies were developed and applied in the setting of verifying commercial microprocessor and SoC platform designs. The experiments in this dissertation were conducted in the verification environment of a commercial microprocessor and a SoC platform in Freescale Semiconductor Inc. and were in parallel with the on-going verification efforts. The experiment results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of building learning frameworks to improve verification efficiency. Functional verification continues to be one of the most time-consuming steps in the chip design cycle. Simulation-based verification is well practised in industry thanks to its flexibility and scalability. The completeness of the verification is measured by coverage metrics. Generating effective tests to achieve a satisfactory coverage level is a difficult task in verification. Constrained random verification is commonly used to alleviate the manual efforts for producing direct tests. However, there are yet many situations where unnecessary verification efforts in terms of simulation cycles and man hours are spent. Also, it is observed that lots of data generated in existing constrained random verification process are barely analysed, and then discarded after simplistic correctness checking. Based on our previous research on data mining and exposure to the industrial verification process, we identify that there are opportunities in extracting knowledge from the constrained random verification data and use it to improve the verification efficiency.",,,
576,North by South: Transnational Dialogues of Chilean and Argentine Culture,"Thus, my hemispheric scope lies within the South to North, and North to South dialogues within the context of Chile, Argentina, and the United States. Both texts and film explore cultural and linguistic repercussions as a part of their transnational or hemispheric experiences in the Americas, and whose hemispheric liminality has not been previously explored. I have limited my analysis to context of these nations and their cultural expressions because of the need to reevaluate and further question how these exilic representations of Chilean and Argentine culture intersect with the growing body of literature and studies on Latin American and U.S. Latino literature and culture. This dissertation examines the role of literary and cultural dialogues between South and North America that resulted from the Southern Cone's exile communities in the U.S. during the late 20th century. The political shift towards military dictatorships in the late 1970s, particularly in Chile and Argentina, caused a mass exodus of South Americans to go into exile across the world. As such, this study proposes an interdisciplinary and comparative analysis of Juan Jose Jusid's film, Made in Argentina (1987), Ariel Dorfman's memoir, Heading South, Looking North (1998), and Alicia Kozameh's semiautobiographical novel, 259 saltos, uno inmortal (2001) that describe such crossings from South to North and back. Given the protagonists' complex responses to their respective exile journeys and returns, I argue that the protagonists embody ""hemispheric liminality"". This concept is most fitting because it describes how exiles exist at the threshold of myriad cultural and linguistic borders, and it seeks to reevaluate previously unexplored nuances in these three objects. The three challenges or formal discrepancies that unfold in the film and both texts as hemispheric liminality are the following: a) the rupture or fragmentation of spatial and temporal limits b) contact with other cultures as border zones, or liminal spaces and c) the representation of ""truth"". Existing scholarship on Southern Cone exile and migration studies largely focus on transatlantic perspectives between South America and Europe given that the vast majority of intellectual exiles who faced persecution by the military dictatorships fled to these countries. In other instances, scholars have also noted internal exile, as a different experience for many of those in the Southern Cone, which maintain and limit their literary and cultural expressions of exile to a single national identity. However, fewer critical literary and film studies have noted the displacement of Chileans and Argentines within the Anglophone context of the United States and their respective transnational or hemispheric representations.",,,
577,Inequalities on the Menu: How Private and Personal Chefs Negotiate Tensions About Status and Self,"With regards to the work itself, private and personal cheffing seem to open doors for some individuals (i.e. women, parents, older adults) who might not otherwise enter or stay in the culinary profession. However, chefs may face discriminatory hiring practices in private employment, and ultimately, these fields may actually contribute to the (re)production of gender segregation within the culinary profession. Women outnumber men as personal chefs, a field with relatively low status and earnings (though this varies), while many of the men in my study seemed to treat private/personal cheffing as a springboard towards work with higher pay, status, and visibility. Tensions between selves, or between the material and ""moral"" spheres of life, contributed to many participants' decisions to pursue private/personal cheffing. Engaging in what I call ""self-directed boundary work"", they recognized a discrepancy between who they were prior to the career move and their ""true"" or hoped-for self. Most of my participants are satisfied with the change; they have taken a stand against overly demanding, inflexible, and/or personally meaningless work. However, not everyone has the opportunity or resources to engage in this kind of self-change. Furthermore, because social forces shape (and limit) our ideas about who we are, making decisions based on these self-conceptions has the potential to reproduce social inequalities. This dissertation examines how private and personal chefs manage tensions about their identity and status. It draws primarily on interviews with private and personal chefs in California, along with a nationwide survey of personal chefs. Both types of chefs work in and for private households, though typically private chefs are employed by one household while personal chefs are self-employed and offer a range of services (e.g. prepared meals, dinner parties, cooking classes). These chefs are emblematic of several recent changes in American work and culture, and they are also very ambiguously positioned with regards to both their societal and intraprofessional status. Located somewhere between chefs (looked highly upon today) and domestic workers, private/personal chefs could be seen as artists or as menial and subordinate laborers. Moreover, most of these chefs are white and/or native born, middle-class, and highly educated, while domestic workers are usually foreign-born women of color. In order to respond to these tensions, the chefs draw symbolic boundaries (i.e. engage in ""boundary work""), asserting their worth and declaring who they are and are not. Some of the chefs' boundary work challenges existing hierarchies and inequalities. They distinguish themselves from restaurant chefs, for instance, and contest the culinary profession's typical status hierarchy. They also criticize clients who act as if they are entitled to the chefs' services. More commonly, their boundary work reinforces societal and occupational hierarchies. Beliefs about the worth of individuals based on their gender, race, or class often underlie their distinctions. By distancing themselves from home cooks and domestic servants, for example, they reinforce the devaluation of household reproductive labor and those who typically perform it. Some chefs also express a preference for clients with ""good"" taste, legitimating class-based cultural distinctions. This dissertation clearly illustrates our ambivalence towards care(work). Household reproductive labor continues to be devalued. Yet, a need to care for oneself and others motivated changes in career paths, and caring for others was a widely shared source of satisfaction with the work. This study points to the need to start treating care as a social responsibility -- the need to start tearing down boundaries rather than drawing them.",,,
578,Econometric Approaches to Public Health Policy: Behavioral Response to Substance Use Regulations,"The third chapter, entitled ""The Substitutability of Alcohol and Marijuana: Where there is Smoke, is there Fire?,"" uses data from the 2002-2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health to investigate recent evidence from a regression discontinuity framework that alcohol and marijuana are substitutes for young adults. The central assumption underlying this method is that the model correctly specifies the smooth function of the forcing variable, in this case, age. I consider a wide variety of parametric and nonparametric models to test the robustness of the discontinuous effect found for marijuana use at the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA). The recent finding that alcohol and marijuana are substitutes is sensitive to specification choice for the whole sample. Regardless of the specification there is no evidence of a significant change in marijuana use by men, while the substitution effect for women is robust. I corroborate and investigate the gender difference using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 Cohort (NLSY97). I find that the reduction in marijuana use at the MLDA by women is heterogeneous by education and race. There is also evidence of a complementary relationship between alcohol and marijuana use for parts of the male sample. The second chapter, entitled ""The Effect of Alcohol Access on Mental Well-Being: Evidence from the Minimum Legal Drinking Age,"" uses data from the 2008-2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health to examine the relationship between alcohol consumption and mental well-being. A regression discontinuity framework at the minimum legal drinking age is used to identify the causal effect of alcohol consumption on short-term self-reported mental well-being. My empirical analysis finds some conservative evidence of a positive, causal effect of alcohol consumption on mental well-being. I find that alcohol use jumps by 20.7% at the age of 21. At the same threshold there is a 9.8% decrease in ""feeling hopeless."" The implied instrumental variable estimate finds that a 10% increase in the percent of alcohol use is associated with a 5.6% decrease in feeling hopeless. This result is fairly robust to specification and bandwidth. There is less evidence of an effect for ""feeling down on yourself, no good or worthless"" or no evidence of an effect for ""feeling nervous."" I also explore the differences by gender and race. This dissertation consists of three separate chapters on topics in health economics. Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 2000 to 2010 the first chapter, entitled ""The Effectiveness of Cigarette Taxes on Older Adult Smokers: Evidence from Recent State Tax Increases,"" investigates the impact of cigarette excise taxes on the smoking participation across the age distribution of older adult smokers. I find that a one dollar increase in the excise tax reduces smoking participation by 2.5 percent for adults age 30 to 74. An investigation of the age distribution finds that results are sensitive to how older adult age groups are defined. The effect of one dollar excise tax increase is largest for a 45 to 49 year old group, reducing smoking participation by over 7 percent. The effect of taxation is more widespread by age for women and low-income smokers. Additionally, women and high-income smokers reduce their smoking participation because of taxation earlier in life. This paper establishes that the impact of taxation on smoking participation for older smokers is diminished at higher tax and price levels.",,,
579,Optimality and flexibility in utilizing predictive spatial cues during visual search,"Predictive spatial cues have been shown to improve perceptual performance for a variety of tasks, including visual search, under conditions of forced fixation. However, the potential benefits of predictive cues during multi-fixation search are poorly understood. In the first study, we present a letter identification search task, done in the presence and absence of an array of spatial cues which framed potential target locations. We show that human observers direct their eye movements towards cued locations to improve their search performance compared to when the cues are absent. We also develop a foveated eye movement model, which takes into account the diminishing acuity of the human visual system in the periphery, for the task. Model predictions reveal substantial performance benefits via predictive cues, the size of which are much larger than what is seen in human data. In all, we see that human observers are willing and able to utilize predictive elements via intelligent eye movement selection of the environment to enhance search performance. In addition, when cue information is made clear, observers are able to readily adopt even extremely atypical eye movement strategies to optimize performance. However, human efficiency in implementing these strategies often falls short of that predicted by a near-optimal observer, even leading to a decrement in performance in extreme cases. Understanding the interaction between human performance and predictive cues, then, is critical to assessing natural visual search and optimizing vocational and life-critical search displays. Visual search is a critical and pervasive part of our everyday lives. However, the ease of which we perform search can mask its remarkable computational complexity. Search targets are often difficult to detect and embedded in statistically complex backgrounds. To optimize search, human observers often exploit known statistical properties of the visual environment which provide information about target location. Regularities in the spatial organization of the visual environment (e.g. predictive cues) have shown to be one such type of statistical property which can be leveraged to increase search efficiency. Here, a series of three studies examines how well human observers can exploit spatially predictive cues during multi-fixation search. Further exploration focuses on highlighting human flexibility in altering search strategy to enhance perceptual performance, as well as delineating situations in which predictive information in the environment may actually hurt search performance. In the second study, we investigate whether human observers will utilize peripheral predictive cues which reside in display regions which have no chance of containing the target (which we call remote cues). In doing so, observers must depart from a commonly used ""saccadic targeting"" strategy, where eyes are directed to likely target locations. When informed of the predictive nature of the remote cues, observers readily adopt an atypical eye movement strategy which favors non-target locations to enhance task performance. A foveated model which ignores the cues reveals that these performance benefits are a likely result of foveating peripheral predictive information. Interestingly, a version of the remote cue task in which observers were not informed of cue contingencies, reveals that while observers can adopt atypical saccadic strategies to improve performance, they do not readily engage in such behavior without explicit information. In the final study, we explore a situation in which predictive cues actually hinder search performance. In natural viewing environments and everyday search tasks, predictive cues often do not mark the only target locations, but merely likely ones. We return to the letter identification search task and modify the cues so that they are only partially predictive of target location. With this increased uncertainty, the presence of predictive cues actually leads to worse performance when the target is highly visible, compared to when cues are absent. A control task in which the spatial cues were not predictive rules out the possibility of the effect being driven by exogenous attentional capture, and a foveated eye movement model reveals that cues hindering search performance would not be predicted by a rational observer. Implications for real-life and vocational search are discussed.",,,
580,Assets Associated with Well-being among Mexican Immigrants: The Development and Psychometric Evaluation of the Mexican Immigrant Assets Scale,"The current study presents the development and validity of the Protective Factors Mexican Immigrants (MIA) scale. This study reports the factor structure, reliability and validity of the MIA scale. Self-report data was collected from 291 Mexican immigrants in Central California. Exploratory factor analysis indicated a 22-item three-factor protective factors solution best explained the data (Internal, Cultural and Community Supports). Results indicated high internal consistency reliability for the internal and cultural protective factors in the sample. Questionable consistency was found for the community supports protective factor. The criterion validity was established by showing that MIA scores were highly positively correlated with participants' subjective well-being scores. The moderation analysis indicated that none of the three protective factors buffered the relationship between risk and subjective well-being for Mexican immigrants. However, participants who reported higher levels of the internal, cultural and community supports factors experienced higher subjective well-being, and lower levels of perceived risk. Implications, limitations and areas of future research are presented.",,,
581,"Epitaxial growth, surface, and electronic properties of unconventional semiconductors: RE-V/III-V nanocomposites and semiconducting Half Heusler alloys","The first part explores the use of dimensionality to control the electronic properties. Here we examine the growth mechanisms and properties of semimetallic rare earth monopnictide (RE-V) nanostructures embedded coherently within a semiconducting III-V matrix. While previous work has focused primarily on the growth of embedded RE-V nanoparticles (e.g. ErAs or ErSb) for applications in thermoelectrics, here we show that by increasing the Er composition during simultaneous growth with GaSb, a wide range of new nanostructures form including nanorods, branched nanotrees, and lamellar nanosheets. These ErSb nanostructures form simultaneously with the GaSb matrix, and by combining molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) with in-situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we image the growth surfaces one atomic layer at a time and show that the nanostructured composites form via a surface-mediate self assembly mechanisms that is controlled entirely at the growth front and is not a product of bulk segregation. Using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), we measure the momentum (k-) and spatially- resolved electronic structure of the embedded RE-V nanostructures and show that despite the predictions of simple quantum confinement models, they remain semimetallic down to their smallest dimensions. These nanostructured composites show great promise for applications in thermoelectrics, tunnel diodes, and fully epitaxial polarization filters. This dissertation explores how modifications to and within a parent zincblende lattice, chemical composition and reduced dimensionality, can be used to engineer materials with functionality beyond that of conventional III-V semiconductors. The second part focuses on Half Heusler alloys, which are a ternary analogue to the zincblende III-Vs. The Full and Half Heusler alloys are an attractive family of multifunctional materials with tunable electronic and magnetic properties. These include both semiconducting and metallic behavior as well as magnetism, half metallic ferromagnetism, superconductivity, topological insulator behavior, and the shape memory effect. In this dissertation we demonstrate the MBE growth of NiTiSn and CoTiSb, two prototypical semiconducting Half Heusler compounds. The films are epitaxial, single crystalline, and show semiconducting-like transport properties with higher electron mobilities and lower electron densities than their bulk counterparts. We also show that both CoTiSb(001) and NiTiSn(001) exhibit a number of different surface reconstructions with phase behavior similar to that of III-V semiconductors, and we propose atomic models for these reconstructions. Using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) we report the first direct measurement of the surface and bulk electronic bandstructure of semiconducting Half Heuslers and show that these compounds are semiconductors with a bulk bandgap, but with metallic surface states within the gap. These studies lay the groundwork for future studies on all-Heusler heterostructures.",,,
582,"Search for supersymmetry in proton-proton collisions at 8 TeV in events with a single lepton, large jet multiplicity, and multiple b jets","This thesis describes a search for supersymmetry in events with a single lepton, large jet multiplicity, multiple b jets, and significant transverse momentum imbalance in 19.3 fb-1 of pp collisions at center of mass energy of 8 TeV recorded in 2012 by the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. This signature targets strongly produced massive gluinos which decay through top squarks. The observed yields in the signal regions, spanning a broad range of event kinematics, agree with the Standard Model background predictions, which are obtained with a heavy reliance on data control samples. The results of this search are interpreted as cross section limits in the context of simplified supersymmetric scenarios in which gluinos are pair produced and cascade decay to a four top quark, two lightest neutralino final state. By comparing these limits with gluino pair production cross sections, gluinos with mass less than 1 TeV are excluded for low lightest neutralino masses, largely independent of top squark mass.",,,
583,Trauma and the Justice-Involved Veteran,"This research focused on the experiences of veterans in two jail diversion programs, a traditional drug court and a new specialized variant of drug court, Veterans Treatment Court (VTC). VTC is similar to a traditional drug court with the addition of specialized components for veterans, including the addition of a Veterans Affairs (VA) justice outreach specialist, who serves as the conduit between the VA and the court. This new approach to intervention with justice-involved veterans has not previously been subject to empirical testing. In order to provide an empirical basis for the need of the VTC program and an understanding of the effects of this program, two sets of analyses were conducted. First, an analysis of seventy participants in a traditional drug court examined differences between matched pairs of veterans and civilians in regards to their drug and alcohol problems and psychiatric symptoms. Veterans were found to have significantly more severe lifetime drug histories than did their civilian counterparts, suggesting that veterans have different needs than civilians, which might be addressed in a specialized program. In the second study, 41 participants in a Veterans Treatment Court (VTC) were assessed on measures of psychopathology, substance abuse, and employment problems and interviewed regarding their trauma histories and experiences while in the program. Hierarchical linear regression analyses revealed the effects of differential traumas on the expression of treatment needs at intake, including psychological symptoms and substance abuse disorders. Combat trauma significantly, independently predicted post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and drug abuse symptoms at intake. While PTSD and depression were highest among those with the most severe combat exposure, drug abuse was highest among those exposed to moderate levels of combat. This suggests that even milder forms of combat exposure can have detrimental effects on functioning. Additionally, for PTSD, post-deployment trauma contributed in unique ways to symptoms above and beyond combat trauma, indicating that non-military stressors have deleterious effects on mental health among veterans. Overall, Veteran's Treatment Court participation was associated with reductions in mental health symptoms, drug abuse severity, and employment problems over time. The particular aspects of the program that contributed to this change did not differ by combat status and appeared to be additional access to services and a streamlined referral process to the VA, as well as increased participant motivation through judicial interactions and engagement with program staff. This study suggests the importance of providing trauma-informed care to ensure responsive treatment for justice-involved veterans, and underscores the notion that Veteran's Treatment Courts can be used to effectively treat the trauma-associated symptoms of combat and non-combat justice-involved veterans alike. The implications of the findings for future research and jail diversion programs development are discussed.",,,
584,Glacial Response to Climate Change in the Tien Shan Mountain Range of Central Asia,"High Mountain Asia (HMA) has been strongly impacted by climate change, and will continue to be impacted by diverse climate stressors in the coming years. A combination of changing weather patterns and retreating glaciers has begun to impact water resources in the region; the rate, extent, and mechanisms behind these changes are poorly quantified due to a lack of data and process understanding. As rivers sourced in HMA feed more than a billion people in the region, increased understanding of climate impacts on regional hydrology is essential for effective water management. Glaciers play a diverse role in hydrology throughout the range, with some catchments having little to no reliance on glacial meltwater, and some catchments receiving almost all of their water from glaciers. This study aims to decipher the impact of climate change on glaciers in the Tien Shan mountain range, a large and understudied region that extends roughly 2,800 km northeast from the Pamir Knot in Tajikistan through China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Mongolia towards the Altai Mountains. As glacial area extents do not present a complete picture of the impacts of climate change on glaciers, the author undertook a pilot study to examine the mass balances of glaciers throughout the range. Mass balance estimates are a proxy for changes in water equivalent stored in a glacier, and are thus essential measurements for understanding the hydrology of the range. The author presents preliminary evidence that high elevation areas in the Tien Shan are thickening, even in the context of retreating glacial tongues. This implies an overall gain of ice mass in the region, despite generally retreating glaciers. This trend was linked to recent increases in precipitation in the range, as well as increases in air temperature. There is not yet enough data to unravel changes in glacier mass balance across the range, although the author predicts that the recently coined 'Karakoram Anomaly' may in fact need to be renamed to include both the Pamir and the western Tien Shan. After validating the algorithm against multiple manually digitized control datasets, the author applied it to a study area encompassing six Landsat scene footprints along the strike of the Tien Shan Orogen. A statistically significant, though minor, gradient in glacier retreat was found, where those glaciers in the west of the range have retreated less than those glaciers in the east. This gradient is explained by differences in regional climate, where large winter storms tend to arrive from the west and break apart and weaken before moving towards the eastern edge of the range. This is substantiated by differences in mean annual precipitation, as derived from Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) 3B43 V7 data, as well as differences in atmospheric lapse rates, where the western region of the range remains cold year-round and the more eastern edges have larger annual temperature fluctuations, as well as a lower overall lapse rate, which implies higher temperatures at higher elevations. Previous studies in the region lack the data to decipher gradients in glacial retreat across the range. To address this data deficit, the author designed and implemented a glacial mapping algorithm which delineates both clean glacial ice---methods which are well documented---and glacial debris tongues, which often require extensive manual digitization. This research is the most significant part of the thesis, and improves upon methods developed to automatically delineate glacial areas using spectral, topographic, velocity, and spatial relationships. The author found that the algorithm misclassifies between 2 and 10% of glacial areas, compared to a ~700 glacier control dataset. These results show significant improvement over previously used methods, as well as large-scale glacier databases such as the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) which are commonly used in mountain-belt scale studies of glaciers.",,,
585,How You Talk About Climate Change Matters: A Communication Network Perspective on Skepticism and Belief Strength,"Climate change attitudes have been explained with a variety of factors, including cultural worldviews, environmental attitudes, political ideology, knowledge of climate change, severe weather exposure, and sociodemographic characteristics. These approaches, however, assume that an individual forms attitudes on the basis of preexisting values or beliefs and do not account for dynamic social interaction as a source of influence. This study introduces a network perspective that accounts for the social embeddedness of individuals, using key relational and structural network variables to predict climate attitudes. This study explores the relationships between climate attitudes and the following social network variables: homophily, network strength, attitude diversity, centrality, network size, and network valence. Climate change attitudes were developed from an exploratory factor analysis, which identified climate change skepticism and belief strength as distinct attitudinal dimensions. Using egocentric data from a nationally representative Knowledge Networks survey collected for the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication in 2011, this study found that network variables were significant in predicting both climate attitude dimensions. Using hierarchical regression analyses that accounted for other known predictors of climate attitudes, this study determined that homophily, network strength, attitude diversity, and network valence were significant predictors of skepticism (R2change=4.8%), while centrality and network strength were predictive of belief strength (R 2change=8.9%). A multinomial logistic regression also determined that strong accepters have the most active communication styles, exhibiting the highest homophily, network strength, and centrality in their personal networks. Directions for future network research and practical applications are discussed.",,,
586,A Microethnographic Discourse Analysis of Long-Term English Language Learners (LTELLs) in a 9th Grade Specially Designed Academic Instruction in English (SDAIE) Earth Science Classroom,"Research on English Language Learners (ELLs) has focused on improving academic language, literacy development and assessment (August & Shanahan, 2006), and instructional approaches (Dolson & Burnham-Massey, 2010). However, less is known about addressing the linguistic and academic demands of Long-Term English Language Learners (LTELLs), recently defined in California as 6 th-12th graders. At the individual level, this is a student ""enrolled in schools in the United States for more than six years, [and who] has remained at the same English language proficiency level for two or more consecutive years"" (AB 2193, 2012). This qualitative study analyzed how the teacher in a 9th grade Specially Designed Academic Instruction in English (SDAIE) Earth Science class provided LTELLs opportunities to learn scientific language practices, and how they took up the instructional opportunities she made available. It highlights the challenges LTELLs face in science classrooms based on evidence at the case study level, underscoring implications for the implementation of the forthcoming Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) in secondary-level SDAIE classrooms.",,,
587,Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Peptide Aggregation on Surfaces,"We simulate aggregation on lipid bilayers in an effort to approximate the complexity of the cellular milieu. While aggregation in vivo would occur in the presence of membrane surfaces, few simulation studies have been conducted on this combined system due to its computational complexity. We have determined that a membrane surface, like a crystal surface, biases toward fibrillar aggregates. However, membrane undulations disturb multi-layered fibrils into non-planar beta-sheet structures, such as beta-barrels. The presence of fibrils on the membrane also affects its fluid properties, creating a hexagonally packed lipid ordering underneath the fibrils, locally increasing its bending modulus and aligning lipid tilt to the orientation of the peptides. Thus peptide aggregation and membrane fluidity affect each other's structure and dynamics. The key general features of a surface that control its modulation of peptide aggregation are its structural order and fluidity. An ordered, rigid template biases more strongly toward fibrillar structures and restricts the set of aggregation pathways and morphologies. The dynamic nature of a fluid surface biases less toward fibrils and enhances the range of aggregation dynamics. We present a series of computational studies using a coarse-grained peptide aggregate model that exhibits a rich diversity of structures: amorphous/disordered aggregates, beta-barrels, multi-layered fibrils, and aggregates of mixed type. Our model has a tunable backbone stiffness that governs the propensity to form fibrils in bulk solution. In this work, we investigate how this beta-sheet propensity couples with the properties of a surface template to influence the mechanism of aggregation. Here, we focus on peptide aggregation in the presence of three templates: a solid surface, the surface of a pre-existing aggregate seed, and a lipid bilayer. Aggregation on solid hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces frequently occurs in many experimental setups. We find that the solid surface strongly biases toward the formation of fibrillar aggregates. Peptide-peptide interactions and surface attraction couple cooperatively on a solid surface to influence the binding/aggregation transition. Aggregation and binding occur almost simultaneously since the surface's crystal symmetry enforces a preferred direction of bound fibril growth, thus accelerating the process. Protein aggregation involves self-assembly of normally soluble proteins or peptides into supramolecular structures. This process is particularly important due to its involvement in several amyloid diseases, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Type II diabetes. Several fibrillization mechanisms have been proposed, including a condensation-ordering mechanism where ordered fibril structures emerge from disordered oligomers and a dock-lock mechanism where a growing fibril induces attached polypeptides to organize individually into fibril-compatible conformations. Seeding peptides with compatible aggregates removes the nucleation barrier for aggregation. We find that the aggregation mechanism is strongly dependent on the beta-sheet propensity of both the seed and bulk peptides. Additionally, bulk peptides that exhibit polymorphism can have multiple pathways to aggregation depending on which class of aggregate they initially form. We find that a fibrillar seed can induce amorphous-prone peptides into fibrillar structures via a condensation-ordering mechanism, thus sequestering potentially cytotoxic oligomers into a more inert form.",,,
588,Smart Growth Machines: The Political Economy of Sustainable Place,"A comparative approach is applied to twelve cities in Southern California and Oregon. Ten smart growth projects (SGPs) in four cities within California and Oregon were identified and semi-structured interviews were held with the respective developers, architects and civic officials, who were involved in the implementation process. Comparative, descriptive and grounded approaches were used to generate themes from interviews and other data sources. The dissertation culminates with a concluding chapter that briefly assesses the findings and their implications for social science, economic practice, and public policy. American urban development is characterized by urban sprawl: the low-density, single-family housing and separated land uses that are dependent on automobile transportation. Sprawl has negative affects for the environment and for social health. In the last twenty years, planners and developers have adopted smart growth principles. Smart growth is a land-use philosophy and practice that promotes higher density housing, mixed-use neighborhoods, more open spaces, transit alternatives to the automobile, and social equity through mixed-income neighborhoods. It is viewed as an alternative to sprawl. The research project first examines the structural and cultural features of communities that both support and oppose smart growth development. This dissertation then examines whether or not smart growth represents a break from the practices of conventional urban development, long theorized as a growth machine. The growth machine describes the collusion of land-use interests with local government to direct economic growth. The purpose of this inquiry is to determine if there is an empirically distinct smart growth machine.",,,
589,Magnetostructural and magnetodielectric coupling in spinel oxides,"Our investigations of spin-driven lattice distortions in spinel oxides illustrate that structural phase coexistence is prevalent for spinels with Neel temperatures below 50 K. In addition to exchange striction, geometric frustration couples spin interactions to the lattice of the spinels MgCr2O4 and ZnCr2O4. Novel spin ground states that are important for memory and quantum computing applications are predicted to exist in these spinels. However, their structural and spin ground states are not well understood. We find that tetragonal and orthorhombic phases coexist in antiferromagnetic MgCr2O4 and ZnCr2O4. The structural deformations in these materials lift spin degeneracy by primarily distorting the pyrochlore Cr sublattice. In subsequent studies, we probe the effect of adding dilute spins on the non-magnetic cation sites of MgCr2O 4 and ZnCr2O4. Substitution of Co2+ cations in Zn1-xCoxCr2O4 completely suppress the spin-Jahn-Teller distortion of ZnCr2O4 while, Cu2+ substitutions in Mg1-xCuxCr 2O4 and Zn1-xCuxCr2O 4 induce Jahn-Teller distortions at temperatures above their magnetic ordering temperatures. The Jahn-Teller distortions of Mg1-xCu xCr2O4 and Zn1-xCuxCr 2O4 do not lift spin degeneracy, therefore magnetic ordering is still suppressed down to low temperatures. We show that only more than 20% magnetic A substituents can lift spin degeneracy in MgCr 2O4 and ZnCr2O4. We begin by examining spin-lattice coupling in the Jahn-Teller active systems NiCr2O4 and CuCr2O4. Orbital ordering yields a cubic to tetragonal lattice distortion in these materials above their magnetic ordering temperatures, however, we find that magnetic ordering also drives structural distortions in these spinels through exchange striction. We provide the first orthorhombic structural descriptions of NiCr 2O4 and CuCr2O4. Our observation of strong spin-lattice coupling in NiCr2O4 and CuCr 2O4 inspired the study of magnetodielectric coupling in these spinels. Magnetocapacitance measurements of NiCr2O4 reveal multiferroic behavior and new magnetostructural distortions below the Neel temperature. This observation illustrates the sensitivity of dielectric measurements to magnetostructural transitions in spinel materials. Finally, in the examination of NiCr2O4 we show that magnetodielectric coupling is well described by Ginzburg-Landau theory. We have also examined the magnetostructural phase transition of the spinel Mn3O4. We show that Mn3O4 undergoes a magnetostructural phase transition from tetragonal I4 1/amd symmetry to a phase coexistence regime consisting of tetragonal I41/amd and orthorhombic Fddd symmetries. Phase coexistence in Mn3O4 is mediated by strain due to a significant lattice mismatch between the low temperature orthorhombic phase and the high temperature tetragonal phase. We propose that strain could be used to control the structure and properties of Mn3O4. Spinels oxides are of great interest functionally as multiferroic, battery, and magnetic materials as well as fundamentally because they exhibit novel spin, structural, and orbital ground states. Competing interactions are at the heart of novel functional behavior in spinels. Here, we explore the intricate landscape of spin, lattice, and orbital interactions in magnetic spinels by employing variable-temperature high-resolution synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction, total neutron scattering, magnetic susceptibility, dielectric, and heat capacity measurements. We show that the onset of long-range magnetic interactions often gives rise to lattice distortions. We present the complete crystallographic descriptions of the ground state structures of several spinels, thereby paving the way for accurate modeling and design of structure-property relationships in these materials. We also report the emergence of magnetodielectric coupling in the magnetostructural phases of some of the studied spinels.",,,
591,"Muslim-Zoroastrian Relations and Religious Violence in Early Islamic Discourse, 600-1100 C.E","Outside of Iran, Muslims denigrated Zoroastrians through unflattering comparisons. They likened Zoroastrians to Vikings, Qadarites, and other groups perceived as unfamiliar, pagan, or heretical. Such comparisons, made by Muslims who had little experience with actual Zoroastrians, were highly rhetorical and intended for internal consumption. Like tales of fire temple desecration, they ultimately facilitated the construction of the Muslims' own communal identity. Therefore, not even the harsh Islamic discourse validates the lachrymose narrative of Zoroastrian history. Rather, the existence of competing Muslim discourses about Zoroastrians reveals the contested, contingent, and contextual nature of Muslim-Zoroastrian relations in early Islamic history. This dissertation treats Muslim-Zoroastrian relations between the seventh and eleventh centuries. It challenges the lachrymose narrative of Zoroastrian history, which overemphasizes the role of religious violence in precipitating the decline of Zoroastrianism after the Islamic conquest of Iran. This gloomy narrative is a product of Orientalist tropes, polemical historiographies about the treatment of dhimmis and the effect of the Islamic conquest, the apocalyptic tenor of medieval Zoroastrian sources, and concerns about the status of Zoroastrians in modern Iran and India. Scholars of Zoroastrianism and Iranian languages have written most of the secondary literature on this topic, despite the fact that most of the primary sources were written by Muslims in Arabic. Since few Islamicists have studied Muslim-Zoroastrian relations, the lachrymose narrative persists. However, there was a harsh Islamic discourse about Zoroastrians. Local histories of Iranian cities are replete with tales of fire temple desecration. Medieval Muslim historians in South Asia often invented tales of Hindu temple desecration as part of a triumphal narrative of religious supersession. Iranian historians did likewise. Although there are a few credible accounts of temple desecration, the secondary literature too often fails to properly contextualize them. These attacks, when considered in context, do not seem to have been motivated primarily by religious animus. The scale and religious significance of fire temple desecration has been exaggerated. There are two competing discourses about Zoroastrians in the early Islamic sources---one accommodating, the other harsh. The accommodating discourse, embedded in reports about the conduct of the Prophet Muhammad, urged Muslims to tax Zoroastrians and, later, to treat them like People of the Book. Abbasid scribes attempted to relieve Zoroastrians of particular legal disabilities by forging the 'ahd-nama, a charter of religious freedom that the Prophet Muhammad supposedly issued to the descendants of Salman al-Farisi. This charter, which belongs to several genres of Islamic literature, probably had a Muslim author. It indicates that there were hybrid religious sympathies in early Islamic Iran, which challenges the lachrymose narrative of Zoroastrian history.",,,
592,"The Dialectic of the Law: Certainty, Continuity and Society in al-Juwayni","This epistemological framework constructed by al-Juwayni in his Burhan is pushed to the limits in his Ghiyathi where he envisions the complete disintegration and dismantling of the Caliphate and its subsidiary institutions in toto. As opposed to envisioning complete chaos al-Juwayni argues for the continuity of society based on religious knowledge which is ingrained in the individual and buttressed by a Shari'a based custom through collective action. For al-Juwayni the complete absence of society is only possible when Shari'a knowledge is completely eradicated from individual and collective memory. In this way, al-Juwayni articulates a more expansive notion of the Shari'a which is responsive to religious, political and social change and continuously acts as a governing force in the lives of the people to adhere to it. As a corollary, the Shari'a more than a static body of laws is a mechanism of governance which transcends any formal apparatus of government and is able to ensure societal continuity in the absence of the latter. Through this dissertation the reader will be exposed to the syncretic nature of al-Juwayni's scholarship which combines different disciplinary inquiries in a unique way in order to fulfill al-Juwayni's two pronged desire for certainty and continuity. Living during a time of intellectual and political upheaval, al-Juwayni's ideas are both alarmingly practical and prescient. For scholars today still grappling with the Shari'a, its future, and prospects for reform, al-Juwayni's thoughts will provide a window into the ways in which classical legal scholars grappled with similar dilemmas. Abu Ma'ali al-Juwayni was one of the most celebrated jurists and theologians of the 5th/11th century and left behind him an extensive oeuvre on topics ranging from the etiquettes of disputation and theology to comparative law and jurisprudence. His scholarly production has thus far not been adequately matched with any comprehensive study that moves beyond an analysis of a singular work. This dissertation aims to fulfill this lacuna by surveying his primary texts to unfurl his scholarly commitments and preoccupations. Through an investigation specifically into al-Juwayni's Burhan Us&dotbelow;ul ul-Fiqh and Ghiyath al-Umam, it becomes clear that al-Juwayni is continuously balancing between his desire for certainty in both theological and legal matters, and his desire to preserve the future of the believing Muslim community irrespective of social, religious and political flux. al-Juwayni is able to do this by proposing a new epistemology which affirms the cognitive capabilities of the individual and creates a framework through which the individual can have practical certainty in their affairs even if ontological certainty remains precluded. Once al-Juwayni establishes this, he is able to argue that regardless of religious and social change external to the individual, the internal knowledge which has become practically certain remains preserved.",,,
593,Filthy Movies and Filthy Germs: The Link Between Pathogens and Tolerance Towards Pornography,"Censorship has been a heavily investigated topic within the field of Communication, and explanations of why individuals support the censorship of media, particularly pornography, have traditionally relied upon either the third-person effect, or theories of personality, such as authoritarianism. However, recent research within the field of evolutionary psychology has suggested that the generation of particular cultural values have arisen because they indirectly influenced pathogen avoidance. Based upon the parasite model of democratization developed by Thornhill, Fincher and Aran (2009), it was tested whether the reduction of pathogens in decreases authoritarianism and restrictiveness of sexuality, which subsequently decreases support for the censorship of pornography. An analysis of country-level data was undertaken to test whether the historical prevalence of pathogens in a country is related to the legal status of pornography. In addition, an online experiment was administered, in which participants were exposed to either a pathogen prime, a threatening gun prime, or a control. While results did not show a clear link between pathogens and censorship, some interesting results were found.",,,
594,Three Essays on Mortgage Default,"The third essay discusses valuation of mortgages with coupon resets, when homeowners optimally exercise the option to default on their mortgage. The analysis shows that the optimal default boundary is discontinuous at the reset date when the coupon after the reset is large, compared to the coupon prior to the reset. The model connects equilibrium yield spreads on these mortgages to initial loan-to-value ratios, coupon structure, time remaining until the reset, expected growth rate in house prices, and the volatility of house prices. Conditional on the initial loan-to-value ratio, mortgages with low initial payments followed by high payments after the reset have higher default risk than the corresponding fixed rate mortgage. The essay also discusses the valuation of balloon payment mortgages. This dissertation consists of three essays on mortgage default. The first essay discusses the determinants of mortgage default. The financial crisis of 2007-2008 was precipitated by default in subprime mortgages. This episode spurred a lot of research on mortgage default. The essay surveys this research with a focus on what determines mortgage default. It emphasizes that the market value of home equity determines default, not the book value of equity. The second essay discusses the valuation of mortgage backed securities in an equilibrium framework that explicitly incorporates default decisions of homeowners, along with essential contractual features of these securities. The analysis begins by valuing Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs), which are securities created by dividing a pool of mortgages into senior and residual tranches. A major finding is that bonds issued on the senior tranche can be risk free, low risk, or high risk in equilibrium, depending on the relative size of the tranche. For house price data from the Case-Shiller house price index between 2006 and 2011, model implied senior bond values decline by 10% and residual bond values decline by 60%. The essay also discusses the valuation of CMO-squared and Credit Default Swaps, which are both derivative securities created from CMOs.",,,
595,Gamer Trouble: The Dynamics of Difference in Video Games,"Gamer Trouble maps an approach to studying sociocultural difference in video games that puts material gaming technologies and design practices into conversation with feminist, queer, and critical race theory. The dissertation addresses these conversations in ways that move beyond diversity politics, engaging the technical, ludic, and cultural frameworks that underwrite the video games industry and contribute to its problematic representations and relationships. ""Gamer Trouble"" takes a layered approach to these complicated issues, investigating facial animation and customization technology in light of the historical scientific and philosophical treatments of the (racialized and gendered) human face, engaging feminist approaches to visual power by incorporating the procedural aspects of gaming into existing feminist film theory through an analysis of Platinum Games' Bayonetta and Valve Corporation's Portal, and interrogating the discursive practices of both fan and academic communities when publicly engaging questions of difference and social justice. Closing with a reading of BioWare's science fiction roleplaying series, Mass Effect, which deploys progressive strategies of diversity while incorporating difference into a hegemonic frame, the dissertation shows how ""gamer trouble"" can manifest in myriad ways, ultimately demonstrating the continued relevance of humanistic approaches to technology, identity, and social justice in a supposedly post-feminist, post-racial age. The dissertation addresses growing academic interest in video games as well as public conversations about gaming in contemporary society and concerns for the representation of minority groups in the games industry and its products. Advancing the interdisciplinary feminist approaches to game studies initiated by analysis of Tomb Raider's Lara Croft, ""Gamer Trouble"" thinks beyond mainstream diversity politics seeking mere inclusion and investigates whether the costs of incorporation into normative cultures might be offset by new reading and design practices, or whether the radical potential of new media is always repurposed by hegemony. Do increasingly numerous skin tone and facial feature options pave the way for a future of progressive avatar design? Do sensibly dressed female characters signal reform in the games industry? Can social media campaigns make corporations and content creators accountable to activists? To develop responses to these questions, ""Gamer Trouble"" draws on traditional scholarship as well as fan criticism, and it experiments with hands-on approaches to studying technology inspired by the tinkering practices of the digital humanities: playing with, modding, remixing, and breaking video game interfaces are part of its methodological toolkit. The resulting work participates in contemporary scholarly practices that employ high and low forms of knowledge while producing both critique and creative work.",,,
597,"No Lock on the Tipi Door: Extending Religion in the American Indian Urban Diaspora: Healing, Renewal and Decolonizing Spaces","In addition, I interrogate categories of analysis in popular use, such as ""Indian"" and ""Indigenous Religion"", in order to arrive at a more nuanced understanding of the competing claims of biological race, cultural hybridity, and a history of forced assimilation upon native identifications. In order to more fully explore the meanings of pan-Indian and trans-Indigenous exchange, I turn to the field of Religion and Healing in Native America. The openness and welcoming of non-natives into native-controlled ceremonial spaces can be explained through an analytic of healing. Accordingly, I argue that native people have identified colonization as a pathology, both mentally and socially, from which both colonizing and colonized populations must recover. The sacred space invoked by Native American spirituality creates decolonizing spaces for the diverse multi-racial participants in that they seek to reinforce an indigenous model of knowledge and practice that resists assimilation. Community ceremonies, such as sweat lodges, function as a hub for the exchange of knowledge and for the healing of individuals and for the group as a whole. Finally, I explore the logics of contestation to change and adaptation within the ceremonies themselves. Tension inevitably arises between fidelity to a sacred tradition and adaptations deemed necessary by the change in context from reservation to diverse city. In these cases, racial identity determines religious authority, where those with a greater degree of perceived ""Indianness"" express more freedom to improvise and adapt in challenging conditions. Whereas among those without biological claim to an indigenous identity, emphasis is centered around performing and interpreting the traditional protocol in a strict manner. This case study in an American Indian urban diaspora community proposes a new model of indigeneity incorporating outsiders, extending the religious boundary, and circulating knowledge without losing an authentic connection to tradition and homeland. In 2014, more than 70% of American Indians live in urban areas away from reservations. This dissertation employs theoretical work on diaspora religion to interpret the effects on spiritual practices of the displacement of Native Americans to cities since the mid-20th century. Using the framework of an urban diaspora, I argue that the split geographical situation results in a center-satellite formation of pan-Indian religion in which Lakota practices are dominant. Employing ethnographic fieldwork among a diverse group practicing Native American spirituality in Ventura County, California, I argue that such urban spiritual networks balance competing forces of indigenizing versus extending within the larger pan-Indian religious community. That is, as Lakota spiritual practices were gradually opened to non-Lakota, and even non-Indian, outsiders, the traditional protocols that govern the ceremonial structure have become more important in ensuring the continuance of an authorized, traditional religion. I trace the logic of assimilation through the relevant history of Native American forced dislocations and urbanization---from 19th century removal policies, prisoner-of- war camps, to compulsory boarding schools for Indian youth, to the Termination and ix Relocation policies of the United States government in the decades after World War II. These migrations and policies of de-culturization contribute to the historical context for a study of mixed-blood natives and non-natives practicing intertribal, Lakota-based spirituality in coastal California from the 1970's to the present.",,,
598,Global Capitalism and Political Control: Investigating the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq,"Neoliberalism continued unabated following the transfer of formal power to Iraqi forces on June 3, 2004, and is taking root in the economy of Iraq. This study demonstrates how the process of neoliberal reforms imposed by the U.S. occupation enabled the rise of an unlikely alliance of Iraqi elites supportive of these reforms. The emerging neoliberal state, however, was saddled with competing expectations: on the one hand, it must be weak in order to allow capital unfettered access and mobility; on the other hand it must be strong enough to bolster and support it. These competing expectations played out in the creation of the Iraqi state and are reflected in its governing documents. Combined with the sectarian polices of the occupation, these factors fueled sectarian conflict in Iraq. This study posits that one of the central goals of invading Iraq was to integrate the country into the global economy. The radical neoliberal policies and the light-speed at which the occupation administration implemented these policies are evidence of the centrality of this goal to U.S. objectives. The American occupation of Iraq built a neoliberal state whose aim was its full integration within transnational circuits of capital accumulation. This inverted the state-capitalist class relations by subordinating the Iraqi state to the interests of the transnational capitalist class and the emerging local faction of that class. Global Capitalism and Political Control: Investigating the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq explores state and elite formation within the current structures of global capitalism through a rigorous study of Iraq in the period between the 2003 U.S. invasion and 2012. Based on fieldwork conducted in 2005 and 2009, it traces the intent and strategies of the U.S. administration in Iraq by examining laws implemented, agreements signed with and on behalf of the Iraqi government, contracts awarded, and policies that were favored and lobbied for in Iraq. It also examines extensive reports published by the Iraqi government, the U.S. government, international financial institutions, and various other international governing institutions and non-governmental organizations.",,,
599,Discretization of Poisson-Boltzmann and Poisson-Nernst-Planck Equations with Applications to Electrochemical Systems,"Finally, we present several examples which illustrate the convergence of presented algorithms and provide two applications, namely in studying the potential distribution around charged biomolecules and in studying the charging dynamics of supercapacitors. Interestingly, in the second application, our detailed calculations provide unreported insights into the role of pore micro-structure on the charging kinetics of porous electrode. Specifically, we find that certain micro-structures that provide continuous conducting pathways (e.g. regular arrays of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene sheets) allow for high-density surface currents which decrease the charging times and hence can potentially improve the power density of porous electrodes. In this work we present numerical methods that are suitable for studying a variety of electrochemical systems, such as charging kinetics of porous electrodes used in energy storage devices (e.g. supercapacitors, batteries, or fuel cells), calculation of binding energies in biomolecules, and fluid flow problems in micro-fluidic devices. A central feature in these applications is the formation of a thin (_ 10 nm) and charged layer known as the Electric Double Layer (EDL) near charged surfaces. Numerical resolution of EDL is challenging and computationally expensive since physical quantities, such as electric potential and ion concentration, vary exponentially across this layer. To address this challenge, we present numerical methods based on adaptive Quadtree grids (two spatial dimensions) and Octree grids (three spatial dimensions) that enable accurate, yet efficient, calculation of quantities of interest inside the EDL. Specifically, we present algorithms for the solution of Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) and Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). These governing equations are widely used to study these various electrochemical systems as mentioned above.",,,
601,Modular wireless networks for infrastructure-challenged environments,"While access to Internet and cellular connectivity is easily achieved in densely-populated areas, provisioning of communication services is much more challenging in remote rural areas. At the same time Internet access is of critical importance to residents of such rural communities. People's curiosity and realization of the opportunities provided by Internet and cellular access is the key ingredient to adoption. However, poor network performance can easily impede the process of adoption by discouraging people to access and use connectivity. With this in mind, we evaluate performance and adoption of various connectivity technologies in rural developing regions and identify avenues that need immediate attention to guarantee smoother technology adoption. In light of this analysis we propose novel system designs that meet these needs. Internet connectivity in rural areas is typically provided through slow satellite links. The challenges in performance and adoption of such networks have been previously studied. We add a unique dataset and consequent analysis to this spectrum of work, which captures the upgrade of the gateway connectivity in the rural community of Macha, Zambia from a 256kbps satellite link to a more capable 2Mbps terrestrial link. We show that the improvement in performance and user experience is not necessarily proportional to the bandwidth increase. While this increase improved the network usability, it also opened opportunities for adoption of more demanding services that were previously out of reach. As a result the network performance was severely degraded over the long term. To address these challenges we employ white space communication both for connectivity to more capable remote gateways, as well as for end user connectivity. We develop VillageLink, a distributed method that optimizes channel allocation to maximize throughput and enables both remote gateway access as well as end user coverage. While VillageLink features lightweight channel probing, we also consider external sources of channel availability. We design a novel approach for estimation of channel occupancy called TxMiner, which is capable of extracting transmitter characteristics from raw spectrum measurements. In this thesis we focus on cellular and broadband Internet connectivity. Commercial cellular networks are highly centralized, which requires costly backhaul. This, coupled with high price for equipment, maintenance and licensing renders cellular network access commercially-infeasible in rural areas. At the same time rural cellular communications are highly local: 70% of the rural-residential calls have an originator-destination pair within the same antenna. In line with this observation we design a low-cost cellular network architecture dubbed Kwiizya, to provide local voice and text messaging services in a rural community. Where outbound connectivity is available, Kwiizya can provide global services. While commercial networks are becoming more available in rural areas they are often out of financial reach of rural residents. Furthermore, these networks typically provide only basic voice and SMS services and no mobile data. To address these challenges, our proposed work allows Kwiizya to operate in coexistence with commercial cellular networks in order to extend local coverage and provide more advanced services that are not delivered by the commercial networks. We study the adoption and implications of network connectivity in rural communities. In line with the results of our analyses we design and build system architectures that are geared to meet critical needs in these communities. While the focus of analysis in this thesis is on rural sub-Saharan Africa, the proposed designs and system implementations are more general and can serve in infrastructure-challenged communities across the world.",,,
602,Testing galaxy formation and the nature of dark matter with satellite galaxies,"The abundance of low mass halos is one of the key predictions of LCDM, which remains at apparent odds with observations of luminous structure. We present new measurements of the spatial distribution and the cumulative luminosity function of satellite galaxies up to a thousand times fainter than their hosts, as a function of host stellar mass and morphology between redshifts 0.1 and 0.8, using imaging from the GOODS and COSMOS fields in conjunction with a rigorous statistical analysis. We demonstrate how these measurements provide powerful new constraints for abundance matching and cosmological simulations in the context of both warm and cold dark matter, and how future measurements of faint satellite colors using CANDELS, will provide important distinguishing power between warm and cold dark matter models. In addition, we present results from a complementary gravitational lens modeling project in which we use strongly lensed AGN narrow-line emission in order to detect dark matter subhalos, demonstrating a promising new method for measuring the subhalo mass function in thousands of lensed systems which will be discovered in ongoing and future optical surveys.",,,
603,Runners Left on Base: Cuban Baseball Defection Experience and a Reevaluation of Baseball Diplomacy,"Due to laws and restrictions in place in Cuba, baseball athletes born there--including many who are considered to be some of the most talented in the world--are not legally permitted leave the country to play for Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. Consequently, a phenomenon of baseball athletes defecting from Cuba to play in MLB emerged in 1991 and has since resulted in more than 250 Cuban ballplayers illegally emigrating from Cuba to play professionally in the United States. Even still, our understanding of their migration experiences, as well as those of their families remains incomplete. By using a lens of transnationalism, this study attempts to provide a more complete portrayal of these experiences. A baseball defection case study based on an original semi-structured interview is also presented to demonstrate the kinds of questions that have not been sufficiently asked regarding these experiences. Lastly, as a means of eliminating the circumstances that create and maintain the demand for baseball defections, an historical examination of ""baseball diplomacy"" is presented to scrutinize its potential for helping to renew US-Cuban relations in the current socio-political environment.",,,
604,A Voice Cries Out in the Wilderness: The French Organ School Responds to the Second Vatican Council of the Catholic Church,"My dissertation investigates Maurice Durufle (1902--1986) and Jean Langlais's (1907--1991) written and musical protestations of Vatican II's liturgical reforms. The composers' initial writings (1960--1969) communicate their determination to preserve chant and the organ, reflected in their music through the presence of a ""transcendent"" harmonic language. Characterized by intervallic symmetry, this language has historical associations with the otherworldly in fin-de-siecle art music. Beginning in the 1930s, French organist-composers known as the French Organ School applied the ""transcendent"" language to Gregorian chant melodies, Latin, and the organ to highlight vertical (human-to-God) dimensions of Catholic liturgy in their sacred music. The French Organ School consequently privileged the Church's identity as a transcendent institution, as existing outside space and time, through music. They then used it to combat what they perceived to be the desacralization of the liturgy after Vatican II. Nonetheless, Durufle and Langlais saw no improvement over the years, and their resolve eroded. Shown in their later writings (1970--1983), they surrendered to this state of affairs either by ironically re-contextualizing or by ceasing use of the ""transcendent"" harmony altogether. Durufle and Langlais expressed ideas similar to sociologists and theologians concerning the loss of transcendence, but they did so through musical language in addition to their writings. By analyzing their compositions, I rescript history of Catholic Church reform in the latter half of the twentieth century through musical language. I show that the music and letters of Durufle and Langlais capture themes that theologians and sociologists have articulated in their work on Vatican II and on twentieth-century Catholicism. As bishops implemented the reforms of the Council, their primary goal was to foster active participation among congregations. Theologians and sociologists have maintained that a consequence of the goal of participation was an over-privileging of relevance, understanding, and inculturation into a liturgy, historically characterized by symbolism, sensory experience, and counterculture. Anything characterized by the latter features---the ""otherness"" of Latin, chant, ritual actions, and the notion that the Church exists outside of time and space---became stigmatized after Vatican II. In short, the Church experienced a loss of transcendence. This shift in liturgical aesthetic consequently included the music that the French Organ School favored. In 1962, the Roman Catholic Church commenced with its twenty-first ecumenical council, Vatican II. Priests from around the world gathered to debate and decide on several issues with the goal of modernizing Catholicism while still maintaining its historical tradition. In addition to discussing abstract matters such as the nature and existence of God, the Council Fathers discussed practical issues, among them being the kind of music appropriate for ritual worship, the liturgy. Throughout Western history, the Catholic Church has cited in its documents Gregorian chant sung in Latin and the pipe organ as the musical expressions best suited for ritual worship. Vatican II's Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, Sancrosanctum Concilium, drew from Church history and recognized chant and the organ's importance as previous conciliar documents and papal writings have done. Yet the Constitution also authorized the use of different styles, languages, and instruments. Once bishops, priests, and liturgists began implementing the reforms, however, folk tunes, jazz and rock styles sung exclusively in the vernacular largely replaced Latin and chant, while strumming guitars, percussion, and piano ensembles supplanted the organ. Amid this revolution, a number of French organist-composers critiqued the liturgical changes through the written word and music.",,,
605,The Public History of a Concentration Camp: Historical Tales of Tragedy and Hope at the National Stadium of Chile,"The Public History of a Concentration Camp: Historical Tales of Tragedy and Hope at the National Stadium of Chile does this and, in doing so, contributes to the stadium camp's history in unique ways. A public history lens provides fresh perspectives on the production of historic work at and memories of the National Stadium-as-concentratin camp over forty years (1973-2013). Its focus on popularly constructed narratives' interaction with official silences and versions demonstrates both how and why stadium stakeholders---especially from the residual---have constructed the tales of tragedy and hope. As it focuses on this popular historical work The Public History of a Concentration Camp has focused, too, on the formative power of the specific place in the formation of public memory. Rather than begin with selected processes or events and look for places where they unfolded and happened, this study gains insight from joining public and popular practitioners who begin at a specific place and ask: what happened here? The unique public and place-based approach also joins recent conversations concerning historic sites of conscience not only in Chile but worldwide. Framing the popular historical work at the stadium generally and its complicated human rights museum 'National Stadium, National Memory' specifically against the backdrop of the sites of memory in Chile offers context for local interpretation of human rights as much as the reciprocal relationship between these organic understandings and international conventions. The Public History of a Concentration: Historical Tales of Tragedy and Hope at the National Stadium of Chile continues this important historical trajectory in the form of a scholarly monograph, only made possible through the popular work that has preceded it. On September 11, 1973, forces of evil converted the National Stadium of Chile into a concentration camp. That day, the nation's military and security forces overthrew the constitutionally elected government of President Salvador Allende Gossens. For the next fifty-eight days thousands of Chileans and hundreds of foreigners experienced violations of human dignity, physical integrity, and political consciousness. The stadium became the physical and figurative starting point for seventeen years of state-sponsored terrorism under the regime of Augusto Pinochet. Today, though, this is hardly a secret, as stories of the stadium-as-concentration camp have circulated since 1973 to the present in testimonies and memoirs, truth commissions and international reports, newspaper and media accounts, documentaries and movies, and ephemeral commemorations and permanent memorials. At different times, in different ways, and for different reasons, former stadium prisoners, human rights activists, journalists, judges, state officials, and scholars have sounded off, sometimes in a complementary fashion, other times to clash. Despite the volumes of searchable material (books, memoirs, testimonies) and less tangible but equally telling commemorative events (vigils, theater productions, public art) that continue at the stadium, no single work has attempted to synthesize, organize, and analyze this historic corpus.",,,
606,Metal-Insulator Transition and Quantum Phases in Transition Metal Oxides,"Correlated transition metal oxides have been a hot topic in condensed matter physics for decades, since they display complex ordering in orbital, spin and charge states. Numerous remarkable phenomena in such materials have been found and studied extensively, such as high-temperature superconductivity, electron-electron correlation driven metal-insulator transition, a rich variety of exotic topological states, and so on. Recently, new growth techniques have successfully created various correlated oxide heterostructures with transition metal and rare earth materials. They offer a promising new platform for correlation, magnetism and new emergent phenomena, and the study of it has become the new hot subject. Titanate heterostructures have caught many peoples attention by hosting extremely high sheet carrier density two-dimensional electron gases, with strong correlations evidenced by, for example, a thickness dependent mass enhancement, and even a metal-insulator transition. Even in the extreme limit of quantum confinement, a single SrO layer in a GdTiO3 matrix, the high sheet carrier density n2d = 3.5 x 1014cm-2 is still half of the usual filling fraction for a Mott insulator. Inspired by this experimental observation, a new many-body ground state is discovered in a SrTiO3/GdTiO 3 superlattice: the dimer Mott insulator. In the dimer Mott insulator, electrons are localized not to individual atoms but to bonding orbitals on molecular dimers formed across a bilayer of two TiO2 planes. Dimer formation halves the charge density needed to reach the Mott state, and the combined effects of polar discontinuity, strong structural relaxation, and electron correlations all contribute to the realization of this unique ground state. Bulk rare earth nickelates, RNiO3(R=rare earth element), display an interesting coexistence of charge and spin ordering and a canonical metal-insulator transition. Guided by experiment and band structure, we introduce and study a phenomenological Landau theory. The unusual magnetic periodicity is simply explained due to Fermi surface nesting of the eg band, and the observed charge order is a secondary order parameter proportional to the degree of orthorhombicity of the material structure. We also predict transport anisotropy resulted from the spin density wave order. The 4d and 5d transition metal oxides are interesting because these materials incorporate both strong spin-orbit coupling and strong correlations, and consequently display distinctive physical properties and the tantalizing possibility of novel topological phases. A paramagnetic band calculation predicts that Pr2Ir2O 7 is a strong candidate for a nodal quadratic band touching state, in which the doubly degenerate conduction and valence bands touch at the zone center, right at the Fermi level. This nodal state is also independently observed in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The degeneracy point suggests that Pr2Ir2O7 is very sensitive to perturbations, such as time reversal symmetry or cubic symmetry, giving rise to the possibility of many novel phases. Indeed, we demonstrate using first-principles calculations that uniaxial strain applied along the (111) direction opens a band gap and converts the material to a strong topological insulator.",,,
607,"Food Redistribution during China's Qin and Han Periods: Accordance and discordance among ideologies, policies, and their implementation","The food redistribution system in early imperial China was ideally designed to benefit all people under heaven ""equally"" within the framework of the social hierarchy, meanwhile providing extra resources to those of lower status and to people in distress. However, the ideology of the regulations and their actual implementation were frequently out of sync, as laws were applied flexibly and human greed worked every possible step of food redistribution. Chapter two examines the reconstructed salary list and the ""Statutes on Bestowals"" from Zhangjiashan to see how the idea of discriminatory distribution was reflected in the salary system of the Han and how the system was maintained in spite of the problem of too little salary for the lower officials. The military salary system, which was combined with the ration system, and imperial gift food are examined in the context of a solution to secure the food supply to military families on the frontier and to the lower salary-grade officials. Chapter three concerns the food distributed to commoners, especially those in distress or danger. This chapter analyzes the welfare food distributions for the aged, female heads-of-household, and victims of natural disaster. I suggest that comfort-food and relief-food policies were actually geared toward pursuing social stability by saving able-bodied peasants and preventing social mobility, rather than having been designed simply to demonstrate filial piety in an emergency situation. The first chapter investigates the regulations on grain storage in the central and local governments, using the Shuihudi Qin legal texts. The ""Statutes on Granaries"" and the ""Statutes on Food rations at Conveyance Stations"" are compared to administrative documents from Liye and Xuanquan to prove that there were significant discrepancies between these statutes and the actual distribution of food. Chapter four deals with ancient Chinese feasting as a method of food redistribution. This chapter examines the two different styles of feasting, the yan [special characters omitted] feast and the pu [special characters omitted] feast, by applying current anthropological theories of feasts to the roles of ancient Chinese feasts. After theoretical examination, the economy of leftover food after ritualistic feasting is analyzed based on recently discovered documents from Liye. I argue that by using the leftovers and byproducts, the rulers fed people of inferior status who suffered from poor dietary conditions. This dissertation analyzes the food redistribution systems of the Qin and Han periods, finding accordance and discordance among ideologies, policies, and their implementation. During the Qin and Han periods, food was given by the emperor to his subjects through various redistribution systems: salaries, rations, relief, gifts, and feasts. In chapters one to four, I introduce each form of food redistribution that directly or indirectly influenced food consumption and the dietary conditions of people of various statuses: officials, soldiers, elders, widows, victims of natural disaster, and convicts. Using recently excavated documents, received texts, and archaeological remains, I analyze what ancient Chinese people of various statuses experienced under the governmental food system, which pursued moral justification and political, social, and economic benefits both for the rulers and the ruled.",,,
608,Playing with the Practice Room: [Feminist] Directorial Interventions in Theatrical Rehearsal Processes,"Through feminist analysis of rehearsal practices this dissertation interrogates the traditional power of the director and the relationship between rehearsal and performance. It argues that traditional directorial power is a lingering and pervasive patriarchal force in the theatre while examining contemporary women directors who actively disrupt their power through the use of non-traditional rehearsal practices. Using first and second hand accounts of rehearsal, as well as interviews and key directing texts, I explore how rehearsal processes---including Lois Weaver's multiple-choice approach to acting, codirection at The Women's Project, and The Wooster Group's unending rehearsal---can impact the aesthetics, structure, and politics of performance. Connecting this exploration to the production of feminist theatre, I detail strategies for enacting feminist ideologies in and through rehearsal and suggest how rehearsal can be deployed for theatre-based social activism.",,,
609,Egyptian Violinists and the Negotiation of In-Betweenness,"Throughout this work, violinists' negotiations of in-between spaces reveal the diverse set of ideas that their instrument can embody, encompassing progress, potentiality, sophistication, and nostalgia. Violinists play, teach, and discuss the violin and other violinists in particular ways to express their multifaceted senses of self. By bringing these individual and interrelated stories to light, I contribute a unique perspective and analysis to our understandings of the continued impact of historic musical exchanges and the rich potential created by positions of in-betweenness. Over the past 150 years, the European violin has grown from a new import to a fundamental fixture in the Arab music of Egypt. Due to the violin's history, physical attributes, and symbolic importance, violinists regularly work between categories often set in opposition, especially Western classical and Arab musics. In this dissertation, I argue that it is this very in-betweenness that makes the violin a powerful tool for Egyptian violinists and composers. Through a series of biographies organized historically, I show how violinists have infused the instrument with different clusters of meaning, performing complex senses of identity and complicating musical categories in the process. I begin with the history of the violin's entrance into Egypt, spanning the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, when violinist Sami al-Shawwa and others used the instrument to negotiate the space between colonizer and colonized, and Europe and Egypt. My next chapter, centered on the so-called Golden Era of Egyptian film and song (1930s-1950s), examines narratives and media examples placing violinists Ah&dotbelow;mad al-H&dotbelow;ifnawi and Anwar Mansi at opposite ends of a tradition-modernity spectrum. I then investigate how Sa'd Muh&dotbelow;ammad H&dotbelow;asan and other teachers negotiate contemporary tensions resulting from the intersection of Arab music aesthetics and Western pedagogical legacies in the Higher Institute for Arab Music's violin program. Subsequently, I address violinists who seek performance and teaching opportunities outside of state-sponsored institutions and the transnational Arab popular music market, such as 'Abduh Daghir. Lastly, I consider violinists' changing role in that market in conversation with the strong sense of nostalgia present for earlier players, as violinists refer to their predecessors to situate themselves vis-a-vis contemporary identity debates.",,,
610,How Mitigating Conflict and Building Lasting Peace Prevents Genocide and Mass Atrocity: A Ugandan Case Study for Central Africa Today,"The central African region is currently experiencing massive conflict, much due to the emergence of violent non-state actors. Anti-state rebel militia groups, predominantly located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Central African Republic (CAR), regularly challenge the state's supposed monopoly of violence and engage in immense human rights abuses against civilian populations. Various efforts to address these atrocities have included global governance responses such as International Criminal Court indictments, United Nations peace accords, African Union treaties, bilateral peace talks, and the involvement of international and local civil society. Additionally, efforts to abate conflict comprise of various forms of intervention including military, economic, legal, and relief intervention. Also, upholding international law, including both human rights law and international humanitarian law, and the introduction of post-conflict management have worked to address militia groups in numerous ways with wide-ranging results. Issues involving sovereignty, weak states, international intervention, and neo-colonialism are all brought to the forefront when looking at rebel militia violence in this region. The questions then that this study seeks to answer are: What are some non-conventional issues present in conflict that must be addressed in order to realize long-term sustainable peace? What role does transitional justice, both at the local and international level, play in conflict resolution and peacebuilding? How can international actors work with local forces to respond in an effectively coordinated way to sexual and gender based violence, war crimes, and forced displacement?",,,
611,Understanding Relationships Between Morphology and Charge Transfer States in Organic Photovoltaics,"Finally, many of the insights and techniques used to study this system are also useful in studying other systems of organic or solution-procesed semiconductors. We optimize the morphology and performance of OPVs made with novel low-bandgap donor-acceptor copolymers. We then find that ionic photoconductivity plays an important role in the behavior of photodetectors made with solution processed amorphous ZnO and in their interaction with organic semiconductors. We first review the basic principles of OPV operation, fabrication and characterization methods, and charge transfer states. We then use grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering to characterize the crystal structures and textures of the polymorphs of the donor and acceptor in our small molecule system, which are important for understanding their blend morphology. Next, we demonstrate a new method to control morphology in this system with the use of a thermally degradable binder polymer. Afterwards, we vary interfacial area and charge transfer state density in this system through processing and characterize it using sub-bandgap external quantum efficiency measurements, allowing us to gain valuable insights about the photophysics of this system. To find new pathways to improve OPV performance, a deeper understanding of the relationships between morphology, electronic properties, and OPV performance is required. This work will explore these relationships, focusing on the relationship between morphology and charge transfer states. We focus on a small molecule material system with only pure donor and acceptor domains, unlike the typical bulk heterojunction composed of donor, acceptor, and mixed domains. The advantage of studying this system is a more well-defined interfacial area and simpler morphology that allows us to better characterize charge transfer states at the donor-acceptor interface. Renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly important as the world's energy demands continue to grow and climate change continues to occur. Photovoltaic power generation has great potential, but most commercial photovoltaic cells have typically been made from single-crystal or polycrystalline silicon which are expensive and energy intensive to produce. Organic semiconductors are one class of solar cell materials that have the potential for low cost due to solution processability, roll-to-roll fabrication, material tunability, and the very small amounts of material required to absorb light compared to crystalline silicon. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) efficiencies have increased rapidly in the past few years and are currently at about 11% power conversion efficiency.",,,
612,Net Green: The Impact of Corporate Social Responsibility on the Natural Environment and Employee Satisfaction,"The third chapter shifts focus from what a business can do to be sustainable to the more common question in environmental strategy: why a firm would want to be socially and environmentally sustainable. One explanation posited in the literature is that corporate social responsibility leads to higher employee satisfaction, which increases worker productivity and profitability. Yet, empirical evidence for the relationship between CSR and satisfaction is scarce. Using a novel dataset, I test this relationship for 3,121 U.S. firms from 1998 to 2012 and find that a company's performance in six out of seven CSR dimensions can explain whether it is rated by its employees as one of the best places to work in the country. I disaggregate the seven CSR dimensions into forty-four individual CSR measures, and from those identify ten measures that are most likely to affect employee satisfaction---six areas in which to improve (employee ownership plans, family benefits, gay and lesbian policies, charitable giving, conscientious labor rights, and product innovation) and four areas in which to reduce negative impacts (toxic emissions, workforce reductions, poor labor rights, and deceptive marketing). This dissertation contributes to the literature in industrial ecology and life cycle assessment by clarifying the displacement mechanism and suggesting improved ways to estimate displacement rate, as well as to the business strategy and the environment literature by crystallizing what is meant by ""green business"" and furthering our understanding of how CSR is likely to increase a firm's economic success. Human activities continue to degrade the natural environment in myriad ways, and at the heart of the problem is industrial activity---the extraction of resources, production, transportation, and use of goods, and the eventual disposal or recycling of materials. Yet, opportunities exist to engage industrial activity in creative, strategic ways that will actively improve the natural environment and help restore it to a state that can sustain human and nonhuman life into the future. This dissertation is intended to be a step toward that future by progressing our understanding in three separate but related topics in the context of corporate social responsibility (CSR). In the first chapter I reenvision what is meant by ""green business."" Although the literature on business strategy and the environment frequently discusses whether,why, and when companies profit from ""greenness,"" surprisingly little has been said---and no consensus has been reached---on what businesses can do that counts as ""green."" Despite the growing importance of environmental concerns to managers, stakeholders, and policy makers, the lack of a structured and practical definition of green business leaves well-intentioned entrepreneurs and corporate environmental managers without useful guidance on how best to make environmentally relevant business decisions. In this chapter, therefore, I propose a new definition for greenness, which states that it is the net balance of the environmental consequences caused by an activity that determines whether or not the activity is ""net green."" To demonstrate the usefulness of the definition, I apply it to four case studies centered on pollution control and prevention activities, which seem prima facie green. Some of these activities turn out not to be net green after all; for others, the green intuition is correct, but with caveats. The core outcome of the first chapter is that one of the most important factors determining whether an activity results in net environmental improvement or damage centers on the concept of ""displaced production."" The second chapter, therefore, analyzes the displaced production mechanism in the context of recycling and develops a methodology to estimate displacement rate. The typical assumption made in environmental assessments of product systems that include recycling is that secondary materials displace primary equivalents on a one-to-one basis. However, displaced production is a complex phenomenon governed by market mechanisms, and the one-to-one displacement assumption was heretofore untested. Chapter 2 advances the understanding of displacement by presenting a displacement rate estimation methodology based on partial equilibrium market modeling. First, I develop a basic market model that explains the underlying price mechanisms of displaced production and identifies key parameters affecting displacement rate. Results from the basic model suggest that one-to-one displacement occurs only under specific parameter restrictions that are unlikely in a competitive commodity market. Next, the modeling methodology is demonstrated by developing an econometric model of the U.S. aluminum industry. The aluminum market model corroborates the basic model and suggests that U.S. aluminum displacement rates are likely to be below 100%.",,,
613,Social Learning Theory and the Use of Instructional Videos in Three Alternative High Schools,"Teachers viewed their use of instructional videos as promoting learning in a few different ways. Instructional videos served to complement existing lessons, enhance and act as an aid to serve more visual learners and support group collaboration and group projects. Teachers viewed instructional video as facilitating learning by providing a link to real-time events and current life experiences. Instructional video addressed multiple dimensions of learning and is a familiar source of information for today's young generation. Teachers viewed the use of instructional videos for encouraging construction of knowledge by providing a readily accessible foundation for collaboration and application of critical thinking skills. Interactive learning activities including online video-based exercises and student-generated video productions are examples. The study used purposeful sampling to identify eight teachers from primarily three different alternative high schools as the participants. The first high school used a military cohort model where male and female students are separated, students live on the premises, and there is limited external contact with family and friends. The other two high schools were based on a traditional school format, were coed, students did not live on the premises, and, outside of the classroom, students were allowed external contact with family and friends. This study aimed to discover teacher views and opinions regarding the use of instructional videos in alternative high schools. The literature traces Social Learning Theory from Vygotsky and Piaget to Bandura and then discusses self-efficacy. The study highlights three building blocks of Social Learning Theory: collaboration, modeling, and observation. The study collected data from pre-interview questionnaires, open-ended interviews, quantitative analysis of the transcripts using key words and acceptable alternatives, and four classroom observations. Teachers viewed affordances to their use of instructional videos as including district support for equipment, teacher training and access to data. Constraints reported included lack of equipment, inadequate online digital information access and differences in perceived teaching philosophies. An important factor in affordances and constraints was the academic climate of the individual school settings.",,,
614,Processing-Property-Performance Relationships in Solution-Processed Small Molecule Bulk Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells,"It is well established that the specifics of the bulk heterojunction morphology (phase separation, crystallinity, etc.) profoundly affect BHJ OPV device PCE. Controlling the BHJ morphology is thus of great importance. Using in-situ thermal annealing grazing incidence wide and small angle x-ray scattering it was discovered that the driving force for phase separation in BHJ OPV systems utilizing small molecule donor materials and functionalized fullerene acceptors is the crystallization of the small molecule donor material. Additionally, it was shown that this crystallization process, and therefore the development of the bulk heterojunction morphology and device performance, can be controlled by using commercially available nucleating agents designed for the clarifying of isotactic polypropylene. Photovoltaic devices that directly convert sunlight to electrical power have the potential to generate terawatts of usable power if they can be produced economically at scale. Solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics (BHJ OPVs) are a particularly interesting photovoltaic technology primarily because they have demonstrated power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 10% and can be solution-processed over large areas, indicating their potential as a cost-effective, scalable source of renewable energy. Whereas BHJ OPVs utilizing polymer donors and functionalized fullerene acceptors dominate the organic solar cell literature, BHJ OPVs have recently been fabricated using small molecule donors with PCEs on par with their polymeric counterparts. The work comprising this dissertation therefore consists of two separate but related goals: 1) understanding and controlling the crystallization of small molecule donor materials in BHJ blends with functionalized fullerene acceptors and 2) identifying the efficiency limiting processes of organic solar cells utilizing perylene diimide (a commercial dye) acceptor molecules and small molecule donor materials. Functionalized fullerene acceptors, ubiquitous in high efficiency BHJ OPVs, are produced via particularly solvent and energy intensive techniques and exhibit small extinction coefficients across the terrestrial solar spectrum. There then exists obvious benefits for using inexpensive, easily mass-produced fullerene alternatives that strongly absorb solar photons. Perylene diimides (PDIs) are a class of organic dye molecules with high electron affinity similar to fullerenes, large extinction coefficients across the terrestrial solar spectrum and relatively high electron mobilities, thus making them attractive for use as electron acceptors in organic solar cells. A BHJ OPV with a PCE of 3.1% was fabricated using a small molecule donor material and a PDI acceptor, making this one of the most efficient BHJ OPV devices utilizing a non-fullerene acceptor. Use of the solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was shown to greatly improve the PCE of these devices. Using UV-Vis and transient absorption pump-probe experiments it was shown that use of DIO increases the structural order of both the donor and acceptor molecule, corresponding to a drastic increase in the efficiency with which excited states separate into free charge carriers and therefore largely explaining the drastic increase in solar cell figures of merit when using the solvent additive.",,,
615,Responding to Perceived Racial Microaggressions: Impacts on the Mental Health and Academic Persistence Attitudes of Latina/o College Students,"The purpose of the present study is to examine coping responses that buffer the harmful effects of perceived racial microaggressions on the mental health of Latina/o students and their attitudes about finishing college. The study uses data from 681 Chicana/o and Latina/o undergraduates matriculating at a predominantly-White, public research university in the southwestern United States who responded to an online self-report questionnaire. Instruments measured: ethnic identity, experiences with racial microaggressions in the university setting, culturally relevant coping responses to microaggressions, psychological distress, subjective well-being, academic persistence attitudes, and demographic information. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to examine how coping responses interact with perceived racial microaggressions to predict mental health outcomes and persistence attitudes in Latina/o undergraduates. Results indicated perceived racial microaggressions predicted lower mental health and academic persistence attitudes. Seeking social support and using reflective coping predicted better mental health and persistence attitudes. Forbearance coping interacted with racial microaggressions to predict lower mental health and persistence attitudes. Reactive coping predicted poorer persistence attitudes and moderated the negative relationship between perceived racial microaggressions and mental health. Findings, implications, and future research directions are discussed with the aim of improving our understanding of how to build resiliency and agency against this insidious form of racism. Though Latina/o enrollment in college has increased dramatically in recent years, these students continue to graduate at among the lowest rates of all other major racial/ethnic groups (Fry, 2011; Aud et al., 2011). Compounding normal stressors experienced by the typical college student, students from minority groups must also contend with the negative psychological impacts of discrimination and marginalization. A growing body of research suggests racial microaggressions are pervasive in the university context (e.g. Yosso, Smith, Ceja, Solorzano, 2009; Lewis, Mendenhall, Harwood, & Huntt, 2012). Racial microaggressions are subtle insults or indignities that belittle, exclude or send denigrating messages to people of color. These assaults are commonly more subtle and automatic than overt racial bigotry and are thus often glossed over as being innocent or innocuous; however, their cumulative burden over time contributes to negative and lasting impacts for people of color (Pierce, 1995). Little is known about the healthy and effective ways Latina/os deal with perceived racial microaggressions in their day to day lives.",,,
616,Modeling Solution Growth of Inorganic Crystals,"This dissertation presents a spiral growth model that predicts the morphology of solution grown crystals (e.g., CaCO3) at ambient conditions. The model also provides quantitative insights into the kinetics of hydrothermal synthesis of inorganic oxides, such as TiO2 and ZnO, using the periodic bond chain (PBC) theory. This mechanistic model could be extended to identify suitable growth modifiers for a wide range of inorganic crystals such as salts and oxides. The ultimate goal is to develop a predictive tool that helps engineer the synthesis of inorganic solids with desired functionality. Crystallization of inorganic solids from solution is of interest in several areas such as biomineralization, carbon sequestration, catalysis, photovoltaics, etc. The end-use functionality in some of the industrial applications is determined by the growth morphology of the inorganic crystals. A mechanistic understanding of the growth process will enable the design of functionally desirable inorganic crystalline solids. The kinetics of crystal growth is governed primarily by the intermolecular interactions between the growth units on crystal surfaces and across the solid-solution interface. Therefore, this modeling effort is focused on the solid-state as well as the solution phase chemistry. The challenges associated with the solid-state chemistry of inorganic crystals, including long-range electrostatic interactions, stoichiometry, electronic structure of surface growth units, etc., were resolved within an easy-to-implement framework. The importance of the solution structure information (from experiments or molecular simulations) has been highlighted appropriately.",,,
617,Re-Integrating Food Systems: Development Potential?,"This study looks at the potential of integrated food systems to meet sustainable development goals. Drawing on relevant literature and field research, it first explains the rationale behind integrated food systems for development, discussing the functionality, thinking and theory behind food system integration. It then looks at the cultural and historical context of the current food system in the chosen research sites of Central and Northern India. Turning next to policy, this work discusses how contemporary food systems in India, and in general, are shaped by agricultural policy, and how policy frameworks may be re-configured to better incentivize integrated food systems. This is followed by a general discussion of several issues related to integrated food systems for development: consumption, gender, participatory approaches and spatial and temporal scales. This paper argues that food system integration can help to achieve specific Millennium Development Goals, most notably reductions in poverty and hunger and environmental sustainability. The researcher concludes that if properly supported by favorable policy measures, funding, and public perception, integrated food systems have the ability to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development goals. Finally this paper concludes by identifying areas where further research is needed and recommending specific policy measures which could be utilized to incentivize the wider adoption of integrated food systems.",,,
618,Three Essays in Health Economics,"The third essay provides evidence that family structure is an important factor influencing attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis, especially for boys. First, we document that a non-traditional family structure is positively correlated with ADHD diagnosis. Next, we compare the gender gap in ADHD diagnosis across traditional, single parent, and blended families, finding that the negative impact of a non-traditional family structure is much larger for boys. The male-female gap in ADHD is approximately twice as large in non-traditional families. This excess gender gap in ADHD diagnosis in non-traditional families is pervasive across child age groups, family income levels, and family size. Our findings demonstrate that family structure itself is a key factor affecting ADHD diagnosis and that boys in non-traditional families are especially vulnerable. This dissertation consists of three essays in health economics. The first two essays investigate how the benefit structure of the United States' two largest public insurance programs -- Medicare and Medicaid -- affects beneficiaries and their families. The first essay examines the impact of an older spouse's Medicare eligibility at age 65 on the insurance coverage of a younger, Medicare-ineligible spouse. I find that Medicare eligibility of an older spouse can crowd-out the health insurance coverage of a younger spouse, reducing coverage on the extensive margin as well as the generosity of coverage. Medicare eligibility of an older wife increases the likelihood that a Medicare-ineligible husband is uninsured. After an older husband turns 65, younger wives are less likely to be covered through an employer-based insurance plan and more likely to have non-group coverage. The second essay investigates the effect of Medicaid coverage of smoking cessation therapies on smoking behavior. Since 1994, most state Medicaid programs have introduced coverage for smoking cessation therapies such as the nicotine patch, nicotine gum, prescription medication, and counseling. I show that lowering the cost of these cigarette substitutes through Medicaid coverage reduces smoking among low-income parents who have ever smoked and are likely to be eligible for Medicaid. Importantly, the effect is concentrated among women with infants, suggesting that these policies potentially reduce children's secondhand smoke exposure.",,,
619,Topics on Functional Ito Calculus and Multiscale Stochastic Volatility Modeling,"This dissertation is divided in two parts. The first topic presented is the functional Ito calculus, introduced by Bruno Dupire in the seminal paper Dupire [2009]. We start with an introductory chapter where the main ideas, definitions and results are discussed. Some original results are also presented. The major original contributions are shown in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3. In Chapter 3, we pursue the functional version of the Meyer-Tanaka Formula for the class of convex functionals. Following the idea of the proof of the classical Meyer-Tanaka formula, we study the mollification of functionals and its convergence properties. As an example, we apply the theory to the running maximum functional. More precisely, Chapter 2 is the reproduction of the original work Jazaerli and Saporito [2013]. From its abstract: ""Dupire's functional Ito calculus provides an alternative approach to the classical Malliavin calculus for the computation of sensitivities, also called Greeks, of path-dependent derivatives prices. In this paper, we introduce a measure of path-dependence of functionals within the functional Ito calculus framework. Namely, we consider the Lie bracket of the space and time functional derivatives, which we use to classify functionals according to their degree of path-dependence. We then revisit the problem of efficient numerical computation of Greeks for path-dependent derivatives using integration by parts techniques. Special attention is paid to path-dependent functionals with zero Lie bracket, called weakly path-dependent functionals in our classification."". The second part of this dissertation is devoted to the multiscale stochastic volatility models, introduced by J.-P. Fouque, G. Papanicolaou, R. Sircar, and K. Solna, see for example the lasted book on the subject: Fouque et al. [2011]. This part is divided in two chapters. The first one introduces these multiscale models and discuss their application to Mathematical Finance. In its last section, making use of the functional Ito calculus, we extend these results to path-dependent derivatives. The last chapter is solely based on the original work Fouque, Saporito and Zubelli [2013], where we present a new method to compute the first-order approximation of the price of derivatives on futures in the context of multiscale stochastic volatility models.",,,
620,"A Search for New Physics in Events with Oppositely Charged Dileptons, Jets, and Missing Transverse Energy in Proton-Proton Collisions at 7 TeV Center of Mass Energy","A search is presented for physics beyond the standard model (BSM) in final states with a pair of opposite-sign isolated leptons accompanied by jets and missing transverse energy. The search uses LHC data recorded at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with the CMS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 5 inverse femto-barns. The search strategy probes models of dilepton production with heavy, colored objects that decay to final states including invisible particles, leading to very large hadronic activity and missing transverse energy. No evidence for an event yield in excess of the standard model expectations is found. Upper limits on the BSM contributions to the signal regions are deduced from the results, which are used to exclude a region of the parameter space of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model. Additional information related to detector efficiencies and response is provided to allow testing specific models of BSM physics not explicitly considered.",,,
621,Media Treatments of Fukushima,"This is a thesis clarifying the problems and events that occurred in the post-Fukushima era in the perspective of media treatments. The thesis will consist of three topics. The first topic is to explore whether mainstream media was able to provide timely and accurate information in dealing with the Fukushima disaster. The second topic concerns the information provided by mainstream media and the fear that important information was withheld and, for political reasons, triggered a wave of ""citizen journalism""(Slater2012), circulated primarily via social media. Social media experienced a trust crisis as mainstream suffered in post-Fukushima for a lack of source credibility. The third topic is to discuss the unique way in which young Japanese people interacted with social media during the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster. These interactions are reinforced rather than challenged the culturally-sanctioned behavior. Based on the analysis of the three parts above, this thesis will find that the distrust of the mainstream media enabled social media in Japan to develop rapidly after the Fukushima disaster, and that social media is believed to break the information monopolization of mainstream media successfully by providing multiple types of information. However, the source credibility of social media is limited. As a nascent phenomenon in Japan, citizen journalism might lead to misinformation and emotional effects among the public after disasters. Meanwhile, as young people are major users of social media in Japan, information circulated on social media will be more influential to young people than other groups. Social media affected the way Japanese youth dealt with interpersonal relationships and participated in social affairs in the aftermath of Fukushima disaster. Rather than question the credibility of information and express their opinions, young people tended to behave in unity with group members and friends to protect themselves from being criticized and isolated by others. In this sense, social media resulted in a loss of self-identity among Japanese youth. Social media may be seen as synchronizing minds rather than encouraging multiple opinions in Japan.",,,
622,Development of a Scale for Evaluating Media Literacy Interventions,"Media literacy interventions present a unique opportunity through which to impact a number of different attitudinal and behavioral outcomes. However, a critical analysis of the media literacy literature revealed these studies show a mismatch between the conceptualizations offered for media literacy and the measures used to evaluate their effectiveness and that there is often no rationale provided to support the use of such measures. These problems in the literature present a major obstacle in the development of systematic research in the area of media literacy, as without clear guidelines or standards for measuring media literacy, studies cannot build upon one another. The purpose of this dissertation is to address this issue in the literature through the development of a scale to assess media literacy based on a strong conceptual and theoretical foundation. The scale development process included the development of an initial set of open- and closed-ended items, three focus groups, data collection with an undergraduate sample, revisions of the scales, and data collection with a second sample of high school students. This process yielded two data sets of quantitative and qualitative data that were analyzed for scale usefulness in eliciting data of high quality. The results show preliminary support for a high quality scale for media literacy; however, more research is needed to continue the development of the measures. The present study marks an important first step in laying out the process for the development of a scale upon which future studies may build. Given that the existing literature draws from multiple conceptualizations that do not provide specificity for how to operationalize concepts and how to design media literacy treatments, this body of literature has not been able to develop in a manner where replication studies or studies that extend on previous work have been possible. With the use of a strong and clear conceptualization to guide measure development, the present study has showed how scholars may apply the same scale development process to develop measures based on a clear conceptual framework to further our understanding of how to measure and design interventions for media literacy.",,,
623,Linked and Knotted Fields in Plasma and Gravity,"The vacuum Maxwell and linearized Einstein equations take a similar form when expressed as spin-N field equations, suggesting that electromagnetic and gravitational radiation possess analogous topologically non-trivial field configurations. The solutions to the massless spin- N equations can be found by complex contour integral transformations with generating functions in terms of twistor variables. Using these methods, we construct the null electromagnetic hopfion and the analogous Petrov Type N gravitational solution. The fields are decomposed into tendex and vortex lines, the analog of the electromagnetic field lines, to investigate their physical properties and characterize their topology. For both electromagnetism and gravity the topology manifests in the lines of force. We then show that the hopfion solutions are the simplest case in a class of Type N linked and knotted gravitational solutions based on torus knots. Reparameterizing the twistor generating functions in terms of the winding numbers of the field lines allows one to choose the degree of linking or knotting of the associated field configuration. Finally, we discuss how the singularity structure of the twistor generating functions determines the spinor classification of the fields in Minkowski space. Since the solutions are constructed by contour integral transformations, the poles of the generating functions are directly related to the geometry of the physical fields. By modifying the generating functions, we extend the construction of the Type N gravitational hopfion to find the analogous spin-2 solutions of different Petrov classifications and characterize their tendex and vortex line configurations. The Kamchatnov-Hopf solution to the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations is a topological soliton, a field configuration that is stable due to a conserved topological quantity, with linking number one. By realizing that the angular momentum can also serve as a secondary stabilizing mechanism for certain field configurations, we generalize this solution to a class of topological solitons with linking number greater than one and show they are stable in ideal MHD. When studied in full resistive MHD, the results of simulations indicate that the non-zero linking number serves to inhibit the decay of the magnetic field energy. Hopfions are a class of fields whose topology is derived from the Hopf fibration, with field lines that are linked circles which lie on a set of space-filling nested toroidal surfaces. In this thesis, we use analytic and computational methods to study hopfions and their generalization to field configurations based on torus knots in both plasma and gravity.",,,
624,"Contributions to Bayesian Statistics: Vector Autoregressive Time Series, Instrumental Variables, Recommendation Systems","Recommendation systems have proliferated in the last decade. Currently, most recommendation systems utilize content based algorithms, or collaborative filtering based algorithms, or a combination of both. The recent surge in popularity of social networks has led to the creation of trust based algorithms. While such recommendation systems have proven that they can be more successful than their content and collaborative filtering based counterparts, they are plagued with problems with cold start and data sparseness. We suggest a Bayesian trust based algorithm that addresses these problems. Our results indicate that our method can be more successful than the existing Bayesian trust based algorithm. The instrumental variables method is a valuable tool in the analysis of simultaneous equations models. Since the estimation of coefficients in the model can be challenging, adept modeling of the covariance matrix is also important. The current standard Bayesian method utilizes an Inverse Wishart prior - a natural conjugate prior. We suggest a flexible prior specification that utilizes both location and scale prior information. Vector autoregressive (VAR) time series models are often used in the analysis of economic and financial data. For these types of datasets, it is crucial to construct models that are both accurate and proficient at forecasting. Various methods have been suggested for modeling the covariance matrix in VAR models. Many of these have significant drawbacks such as forcing too many restrictions, or being unable to fully utilize prior information. We suggest a flexible prior specification that fully utilizes available prior information.",,,
625,"The politics of youth citizenship in Costa Rica, 1940s -- 1980s","Conversely, elites conceptualized some forms of outside influence, namely United States aid and foreign-funded improvements to education, as positive. State actors welcomed these influences though they had the potential to foment opposition through the creation of a more educated and politically-sensitized youth. And it was, in fact, educated youth who organized en masse on April 24, 1970 under the banner of a new rights-bearing and responsibility-wielding youth identity, and posed a dramatic challenge to the granting of a mineral exploration concession to the international corporation ALCOA. The way that Costa Rican youth articulated their coalescence around a youth identity before and after the anti-ALCOA demonstrations is one of the most notable aspects of this event. Between 1948 and 1985, the idea of youth as a social category underwent a slow evolution in Costa Rica. From being a relatively meaningless term during the post-civil-war period that often solely denoted a regulation- or statute-based category, ""youth"" became a complex, identity-based signifier by the late nineteen sixties. By looking at Costa Rican state institutions, the Catholic Church, corporate philanthropists, non-governmental institutions, youth demonstrations, women's morality clubs, and the actions and discourse of a wide range of citizen stakeholders, this thesis explores changes to the conceptualization of youth in Costa Rica during this period. Using primary sources including newspaper articles and editorials, agency memoranda from child and youth welfare agencies, political pamphlets, published speeches by government officials, non-governmental organizations' board minutes, letters, and reports, this dissertation traces how youth, often conceptualized as non-citizens in post-war Costa Rica, were primarily the focus of protective efforts and the subjects of political struggles between the State, the Church and other actors. Complicating these struggles in the nineteen fifties and sixties was a rising tide of influences, many of which elites articulated as having originated outside of Costa Rica or as being foreign to Costa Rica, including commercial culture and leisure, Communism, and trans-national youth identities. These influences were publicly rejected as having the potential to negatively affect Costa Rica's youth and, by extension, the well-being of the Costa Rican nation. The specific discourse youth deployed in articulating this new identity demonstrated the opportunities and limitations that had been afforded to youth within the uniquely Costa Rican cultural context. Costa Rica's myth of democratic exceptionalism factored heavily into the way these opportunities and limitations bore out. During and after ALCOA, Costa Rica's youth both appropriated and rejected trans-national revolutionary discourses of the time in an attempt to position themselves squarely within the boundaries of Costa Rica's brand of patriotism, thus legitimizing their efforts in the eyes of some elites, including Catholic luminaries and various politicians.",,,
626,Hybrid Architectures for Next Generation Batteries,"Efficient energy storage technologies that utilize sustainable resources will enable the development and implementation of new modes of transportation, such as electric vehicles, and renewable electricity generation, such as wind turbines, and photovoltaics, to name a few. Electric vehicles require mobile energy sources while intermittent renewable energy technologies require stationary energy storage. Currently, electric vehicle technology is confined by the ubiquitous Li-ion intercalation type chemistries that dominate the rechargeable battery market. These chemistries, while extremely efficient, suffer from low gravimetric capacities due to the high percentage of spectator atoms, atoms not able to store charge, that make up many of the cathode materials. While battery weight is not as much of a consideration for the stationary energy storage required for intermittent renewable energy, for example, the cost and sustainability of the materials used in intercalation systems is of great consideration. In this regard, intercalation systems again fall short of these ideal requirements. Expensive and relatively rare elements, such as Co, are commonly used in intercalation cathodes preventing widespread application. The work in this thesis describes the development of next generation energy storage devices that utilize abundant and sustainable resources. We develop known and discover new redox chemistries that go beyond Li-ion technology. Careful evaluation of the underlying chemistries allows detailed insights into redox mechanisms and provides functional handles to control device performance. In Chapters 2-4, the reversible redox chemistry of S, a very abundant and geographically disperse resource, as a cathode will be discussed. A new understanding of the chemistry occurring during the discharge of the Li-S system will be detailed in Chapters 2 and 3 and the development of a new S-based electrochemical system, the Ca-S system, will be described in Chapter 4. This system uniquely utilizes a Ca metal anode, which is a much more abundant and easily attainable resource than Li. In Chapter 5, alternative Ca sources to Ca metal anodes will be discussed. Chapter 6 details technical challenges when approaching alternative anode research, for example the materials discussed in Chapter 5. Finally, in Chapter 7 the redox chemistry of materials derived from renewable organic resources is detailed namely organic networks with N heteroatoms.",,,
627,Conversations with Native Speakers: Acquiring Japanese as a Second Language,"In the other two case studies, I examine the question: To what extent do the conversational grammars of non-native speakers exhibit the same relationships between grammatical form and discourse function as the conversational grammars of native speakers? In Chapter 4, I conduct a qualitative and quantitative analysis of Noun-Modifying Constructions (NMCs) and compare the usage of NMCs among native vs. non-native speakers, based on discourse factors, finding that the non-native speakers, especially those with more experience living in Japan, produced NMCs with frequencies and distributions similar to those of the native speakers. The first case study (Chapter 3) investigates the types of explicit and implicit interactional feedback (comprising negative as well as positive evidence) that native speakers provide in conversation with non-native speakers. I conduct a qualitative analysis of points in the conversation related to the non-native speaker's language ability, including instances of explicit metalinguistic discussion and of implicit feedback, such as recasts of non-native speaker utterances, and I suggest the ways in which these function as potential L2 learning mechanisms. Children acquire their L1 entirely through interactions with other speakers; in the same way, L2 learners benefit from participating in conversations with native speakers. I take a discourse-functional view of native speaker competence, assuming that positive evidence (language in use), comprising both frequency and contexts of usage, plays an important role in native speakers' mental representations and acquisition of grammar. If we assume that any comfortably proficient L2 speaker cannot have acquired that language ability solely from textbooks or classroom instruction, then the question arises: in what ways does conversation help language learners acquire a discourse-based grammar mirroring that of native speakers? I address this question across three case studies, using data from twelve conversations, each between one native speaker and one non-native speaker of Japanese. In Chapter 5, a quantitative analysis of subject argument realization, I use a mixed-effects model to show that both native and non-native speakers' patterns of subject realization are influenced by discourse-pragmatic factors such as givenness and contrast, and that the patterns observed among non-native speakers mirror those in native speakers' speech. I propose that non-native speakers can only demonstrate such similar sensitivities to discourse-pragmatic factors if exposed to native-speaker-like frequencies of use in conversation. The findings of this case study allow for a glimpse into the impact of positive evidence from natural input on L2 learners' acquisition of discourse-based grammar.",,,
628,Resource-Efficient Wireless Systems for Emerging Wireless Networks,"As the wireless medium has become the primary source of communication and Internet connectivity, and as devices and wireless technologies become more sophisticated and capable, there has been a surge in the capacity demands and complexity of applications that run over these wireless devices. To sustain the volume and QoE guarantees of the data generated, the opportunity and need to rethink wireless network design across all the layers of the protocol stack has firmly emerged as a solution to enable the timely and reliable delivery of data, while handling the inherent challenges of a crowded wireless medium, such as congestion, interference, and hidden terminals. The research work presented in this dissertation builds efficient solutions and protocols with a theoretical foundation to address the challenges that arise in rethinking wireless network design. Example challenges include managing the overhead associated with complex systems. My work particularly focuses on the opportunities and challenges of sophisticated technology and systems in emerging wireless networks. I target the main thrusts in the evolution of wireless networks that create significant opportunity to achieve higher theoretical capacity, and have direct implications on our day-to-day wireless interactions: from enabling multifold increase in capacity in wireless physical links, to developing medium access techniques to exploit the high speed links, and making the applications more bandwidth efficient. I build deployable, and resource-aware wireless systems that exploit higher bandwidths by leveraging and advancing diverse research areas such as theory, analysis, protocol design, and wireless networking. Specifically, I identify the erroneous assumptions and fundamental limitations of existing solutions in capturing the true and complex interactions between wireless devices and protocols. I use these insights to guide practical and efficient protocol design, followed by thorough analysis and evaluation in testbed implementations via prototypes and measurements. I show that my proposed solutions achieve significant performance gains, at minimum cost to overhead.",,,
629,Mitochondrial oxidative capacities: Does functional capacity match maximum physiological demand?,"The oxygen-dependent processes of ATP synthesis in mitochondria is same in all mammals and birds (endothermic animals). However, some endothermic species have higher maximum O2 consumption rate per unit mass (VO 2 max/Mb) than others during aerobic exercise. It is unclear whether the mitochondria of these endothermic species achieving higher VO2 max/Mb have inherently higher biochemical capacities for respiration than mitochondria from other species. To understand the relation between functional capacities (biochemical capacity) and maximum physiological requirements, the respiration rates of flight muscle mitochondria of hovering C. anna (in vivo mVO2) and the maximum oxygen consumption rate of isolated mitochondria (in vitro mVO2) were compared. To measure whole body VO2max of C. anna, C. anna hovered in heliox (21% oxygen and 79% helium gas mixture). In vivo mVO2 of C. anna flight muscles calculated using whole body VO2max was 10.5 ml O2/min x ml on average. Since in vitro mVO2 values are substrate-dependent, in vitro mVO2 was measured using different combinations of substrates: ones that donate electrons to the electron transport chain via NADH and those that donate electrons via both NADH and FADH2 (Gnaiger, 2009). The NADH and FADH2 -linked substrate combination elicited the highest in vitro mVO2 which was 6.8 ml O2/min x ml on average. The in vitro mVO2 measurement methods used in this study brought a gap between in vivo and in vitro rates closer than the previous study (Suarez et al., 1990); however, biochemical capacity was still 17.3 % lower than the maximum physiological rate. C. anna flight muscle cytochrome aa3 content measured using spectrophotometric method was 83.88 n mol/g muscle. The electron flux through cytochrome aa3 calculated using cytochrome aa3 content and VO2 of C. anna hovering in heliox at 86.7 electrons/second. This electron flux rate is only slightly higher than the rate of rat heart, but cytochrome aa3 content per gram muscle is about 6 times higher in hummingbird flight muscle than the rat heart muscle. This indicates the level of cytochrome aa3 expression and the physiological requirements are matched to maximum requirements in both hummingbird pectoral and rat cardiac muscles.",,,
630,Generation 2.5 Corporate Social Responsibility: Unlocking the Business Value in the Future of Corporate Citizenship,"This paper seeks to explore corporate social responsibility in the apparel industry taking into account the perspective of corporations active in the corporate social responsibility space. It also examines critiques of such commitments. The goal is to identify corporate strategies for social responsibility and how well they align with scholarly critiques and recommendations for the future. The first section of this paper will discuss the conceptualization of corporate social responsibility and the value of corporate social responsibility to corporations. The next section explains why the apparel industry is a particularly sensitive topic in relation to corporate social responsibility and also why it has a considerable amount of potential for significant positive impact. This section will involve the conceptual development of three generations of corporate social responsibility strategy, introducing the notion of a ""Generation 2.5,"" which I argue could provide the future focus of corporate social responsibility in the apparel industry. Finally, I will discuss three case studies of major apparel companies, Nike, Gap, and Patagonia, which have a reputation for being at the forefront of innovation for corporate social responsibility strategies. The goal is to discover the significance of corporate social responsibility in the apparel industry for companies, consumers, workers, and all people with a stake in the operations of these companies. Finally, this paper concludes by exploring the shortcomings of current practices and the future of corporate social responsibility.",,,
631,Sequential Monte Carlo methods: applications to disease surveillance and fMRI data,"We also analyze real and simulated fMRI data using a state-space formulation of a regression model with autocorrelated error structure. We demonstrate via simulation that analyzing autocorrelated fMRI data using a model with independent error structure can inflate the false positive rate of concluding significant neural activity, and we compare methods of accounting for autocorrelation in fMRI data by examining ROC curves. In addition, we show that comparing models with different autocorrelated error structures on the basis of the independence of fitted model residuals can produce misleading results. Using data collected from an fMRI experiment featuring an episodic word recognition task, we estimate parameters in dynamic regression models using maximum likelihood and identify clusters of low and high activation in specific brain regions. We compare alternative models for fMRI time series from these brain regions by approximating the marginal likelihood of the data using particle learning. Our results suggest that a regression model with a dynamic intercept is the preferred model for most fMRI time series in the episodic word recognition experiment within the brain regions we considered, while a model with a dynamic slope is preferred for a small percentage of voxels in these brain regions. We present contributions to epidemic tracking and analysis of fMRI data using sequential Monte Carlo methods within a state-space modeling framework. Using a model for tracking and prediction of a disease outbreak via a syndromic surveillance system, we compare the performance of several particle filtering algorithms in terms of their abilities to efficiently estimate disease states and unknown fixed parameters governing disease transmission. In this context, we demonstrate that basic particle filters may fail due to degeneracy when estimating fixed parameters, and we suggest the use of an algorithm developed by Liu and West (2001), which incorporates a kernel density approximation to the filtered distribution of the fixed parameters to allow for their regeneration. In addition, we show that seemingly uninformative uniform priors on fixed parameters can affect posterior inferences, and we suggest the use of priors bounded only by the support of the parameter. We demonstrate the negative impact of using multinomial resampling and suggest the use of either stratified or residual resampling within the particle filter. We also run a particle MCMC algorithm and show that the performance of the Liu and West (2001) particle filter is competitive with particle MCMC in this particular syndromic surveillance model setting. Finally, the improved performance of the Liu and West (2001) particle filter enables us to relax prior assumptions on model parameters, yet still provide reasonable estimates for model parameters and disease states.",,,
632,Genesis and Evolution of the Pamir Plateau: a Petrochronologic View,"The India-Asia collision is the foremost setting to study continent-continent orogenesis, yet mid--deep crustal exposures are rare. In contrast, the Pamir Plateau provides extensive aerial exposure of the deep crust within six gneiss domes. The domes contain a variety of Cenozoic-age metamorphic and igneous rocks exhumed from 8--10 kbar and 700 C. The growth and recrystallization of major and accessory phases in these rocks such as garnet, monazite, and titanite record a robust history of the evolution of the plateau through crustal thickening, metamorphism, and subsequent ongoing collapse. Extracting this record requires accurately understanding and directly linking minerals response to the crustal process of interest. Petrochronology by in situ U/Th-Pb chronometry, trace-element analysis, and thermobarometry is the key to unlocking the physiochemical evolution of the Pamir mid-- deep crust, and orogenic processes in general around the world. The following dissertation contains I) an evaluation of whether titanite records volume-diffusion closure or (re)crystallization, II) a comparison of the monazite record from the Central Pamir and Northern Himalaya gneiss domes, and III) campaign-style titanite petrochronology investigation of the onset of collapse in the Pamir plateau.",,,
633,"Antarctic raised beaches: Insight on geochronology, relative sea level, and coastal processes","The distribution of raised beaches throughout the Holocene around Antarctica show synchronous periods of beach formation in the Antarctic Peninsula and the Ross Sea centered at 2.0, 3.5, and 5.3 ky BP while East Antarctic (outside of the Ross Sea) beach formation is out-of-phase with the rest of the Antarctica at 3.2, 4.2, 5.8, and 6.5 ky BP. The distribution of beaches in the South Shetland Islands is dominated by enhanced beach formation between 0.2 and 0.7 ky BP most likely due to rapid post-glacial rebound associated with the Little Ice Age with minor peaks in beach formation from 1.3-2.2, 5.1-5.6, and 6.0-6.5 ky BP. Beach formation results from higher wave exposure during periods of reduced sea ice observed from comparison with Holocene sea-ice proxies. The anti-phasing of beach formation in the Antarctic Peninsula and Ross Sea compared to East Antarctica is markedly similar to the phasing of modern and Holocene climate forcing around Antarctica. Through a series of cleaning methods applied to sample carriers used for optically stimulated luminescence measurements of sediment, the contamination of dose-dependent, variable signals from sample carriers previously assumed to have neutral signals is eliminated through a series of cleaning methods (Chapter 2). An analysis of optically stimulated luminescence characteristics of quartz from cobble surfaces with sample petrology and cathodoluminescence provides insight on the suitability of Antarctic materials for optically stimulated luminescence dating (Chapter 3). The limited amount of quartz (<10%) found in the majority of the samples often occurs as intergrowths in feldspars characterized by irregular, anhedral crystal form. The findings of these studies focused on Antarctic raised beaches have implications for understanding sea-level, glacial isostatic adjustment, ice-sheet histories, and coastal processes since the Last Glacial Maximum. A lack of discernible relationship between optically stimulated luminescence and cathodoluminescence properties and petrology suggest that cathodoluminescence behavior and petrology are not responsible for the poor luminescence characteristics observed from quartz extracted from cobble surfaces. A relative sea-level history of Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula derived from optically stimulated luminescence-dated beach cobble surfaces further constrains post-glacial rebound since the Last Glacial Maximum (Chapter 4). New ages suggest the Holocene marine limit for Marguerite Bay is 21.7 masl with an age of ~ 5.5-7.3 ka. Our favored hypothesis for the ages of the beaches from 21.7-40.8 masl at Calmette Bay is that the beaches formed prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. The temporal distribution of circum-Antarctic raised beaches throughout the Holocene is utilized to determine the relationship between wave-energy, sea ice, and coastal evolution (Chapter 5). Beaches are preserved above sea level along ice-free portions of the Antarctic coastline due to post-glacial rebound associated with glacial isostatic adjustment since the Last Glacial Maximum. The ages and elevations of these beaches provide relative sea-level constraints for glacial isostatic adjustment models and ice-sheet histories. Due to harsh field conditions and difficulty dating Antarctic materials, a lack of geochronological constraints on raised beaches limits our understanding of relative sea level around Antarctica. The focus of the studies discussed here is on Antarctic raised beaches with goals to improve the methods of dating cobble surfaces from raised beaches using optically stimulated luminescence and use the dated beaches to reconstruct relative sea level and better understand Antarctic coastal processes throughout the Holocene.",,,
634,Dramatic Impact: An exploration of the relationship between drama and affect in foreign language Spanish,"This study analyzed the relationship between students' affective states (i.e. speaking-anxiety and speaking-confidence) and doing drama and performative activities in order to address the dearth of evidence-based research on affective change. A mixed-methods approach enabled the analysis of different perspectives of the relationship between both explicit and implicit attitudes towards speaking-anxiety and speaking-confidence and the participation in drama and performative activities over the duration of the course and not just at a singular point. This approach, involving the use of closed- and open-response questionnaires, participant interviews, and classroom observations, allowed for a more complete analysis of the multidimensional affective state construct than a self-report survey alone would permit. Fourteen students, enrolled in a third-year level Advanced Grammar and Composition course of foreign language Spanish at a large public university in the United States, completed surveys on their explicit and implicit feelings about speaking in Spanish and their attitudes towards drama and performative activities. The questionnaires were completed both at the beginning and at the end of the course in order to examine and compare the changes that had occurred. Follow-up interviews were also conducted with volunteer participants. Daily classroom observations were used to further explain and understand the findings. Guiding students in the development of their oral communication skills is one of the most important parts of a foreign language course. However, the success in achieving this goal can be impeded or assisted by a student's affective state (i.e. anxiety or confidence) when speaking. One possible way to produce a more positive affective state is to use drama and performative activities (e.g. plays, role-plays, skits, improvisational exercises, etc.). Conflicting views have been presented as to whether drama and performative activities trigger anxiety or reduce it since performance-based activities have been claimed to do both. Yet, the students' affective states traditionally have not been measured in terms of how they changed but rather how they were related or not to course grades and/or linguistic performance, leaving a gap in the previous research on how affect itself shifts over the period of a course, particularly one that requires students to perform in front of one another. The study revealed that in general participants, despite not being self-selected to choose this type of pedagogy, had a positive affective relationship with drama and performative activities in that both quantitative and qualitative results showed a majority of students citing increased speaking-confidence, decreased speaking-anxiety and increased positive attitudes towards using drama and performative activities. Although two students felt increased speaking-anxiety and decreased implicit speaking-confidence, they also felt increased explicit speaking confidence. This showed that as is to be expected, on an individual level some variation occurred. Speaking and doing drama and performative activities became more connected activities in the minds of the participants as shown in a comparison of a pre and post cluster analysis. These results showed that there was a change in affective state after a drama/PA course and that affective states should be measured on multiple occasions. These positive results seemed to be most closely related to the nature of the course, which gave a direct purpose to group activities and led to closeness between the students. The group bonding and rehearsal/task repetition, facilitated increased comfort and confidence when speaking. The results of the study contribute to an understanding of the dynamic nature of speaking-anxiety, speaking-confidence, and attitudes towards using affectively challenging pedagogical tools in a foreign language class. Practical suggestions for pedagogy and future research were also identified.",,,
635,"Landscape, Politics, and Identity: Countess Mahaut of Artois' Natural Resource Management, ca. 1302-1329","The reign of Countess Mahaut of Artois (r. 1302-29) was marred by a series of economic, political, and environmental crises. Her unusually detailed financial accounts, which survive in impressive numbers, represent a unique opportunity to explore the interconnections between man and environment in a pre-modern world. I demonstrate that Mahaut and her retainers carefully managed, and even expanded, the estate of Hesdin and her other holdings as part of an ecological system. Further, I prove that rural parks were critical political tools used for more than the production of venison. Crucial elements in a social and political program, Mahaut's park shored up her political authority in the face of economic, environmental, and political disturbance. I supplement my analysis of Mahaut's financial accounts and political documents with a study of contemporary literature on the perception of gardens, parks, agriculture, as well as its many uses. These documents illustrate the pervasiveness of the natural resource management utilized on Mahaut's lands. I argue that parks were an aristocratic convention in northern Europe, and that they were integral elements in the aggressive fight for political dominance in the twilight years of the French feudal state. Mahaut and other high-ranking nobles maintained large, elaborate homes and pleasure parks during such crises because the manipulation of natural resources and landscapes affirmed political authority and funded the elite lifestyle as service-based relationships crumbled. Thus, this dissertation helps us understand how medieval people perceived and exploited the environment, and how, in turn, local environments shaped medieval society and politics.",,,
636,Macroeconomic Implications of Changes in the Composition of the Labor Force,"The first two chapters created theoretical models that could account for aggregate trends of interest, but did not explore the micro-foundations in great detail. The third chapter delves into the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the American Time Use Survey to explore how households respond to female labor supply on both the extensive and intensive margins. The goal is to determine the extent to which expenditure and time use patterns differ between married households in which both the male and female are employed and married households in which only the male is employed. The constraint in this analysis is the ability to overcome selection issues with the available data. Person fixed-effects will be used in the regression analysis performed with the PSID data to mitigate the selection issues. The same strategy cannot be implored with the ATUS because it is a repeated cross-section. Therefore, we control for as many variables as possible that may affect expenditures (eg. age, education, number of children, etc.). The results are consistent with the story proposed in the first two chapters. Women spend less time taking care of their children, less time cleaning the house, and less time preparing meals for their family. Households in which the women are employed also purchase more daycare services and meals away from the home. As sectors grow at different rates, employment shifts to the more productive sector if the goods are close substitutes and away from the more productive sector if the goods are complements. Male employment moves from the manufacturing sector to the market services sector and female employment moves out of the home sector to market services. Working women replace home production with market purchased services. Since home production and consumption are not included in the national accounts, a shift from home to market consumption increases the NIPA consumption to output ratio, consistent with the previous study. The first chapter of my dissertation focuses broadly on the ten percentage point increase in the consumption to output ratio since the 1950's. There has been much speculation from the popular press that this increase implies that Americans are consuming beyond their means and that this path of consumption is unsustainable. Economists who have researched this trend can account for part of the increase through an increase in the depreciation rate and decline in the population growth rate. Both imply that a necessary condition for an increasing consumption to output ratio is the economy must be in transition to a new balanced growth path. I find that balanced growth is an unnecessary condition, and the important aspect of the economy to model to capture this trend is the home sector. The home sector is not included in the National Income and Product Accounts, but it produces consumption goods that have many close substitutes with the market sector. After 1950, the growth rate of market total factor productivity was greater than the growth rate of home total factor productivity and hours of work shifted from the home sector to the market sector. Unmeasured home goods were replaced by measured market substitutes and since home consumption and production is not included in NIPA, the consumption to output ratio increased. The increase in the consumption to output ratio is therefore a natural outcome of structural transformation and can occur when the economy is on an aggregate balanced growth path. The United States has experienced several sectoral shifts over the last hundred years, a shift from agriculture to manufacturing, manufacturing to services, and within these sectors the shift from the home sector to the market sector. These shifts have been attributed in the literature to different sectoral productivity growth rates. It is likely that these sectoral re-allocations have far reaching impacts on economic indicators we measure. My dissertation concerns the effect of the difference in productivity growth rates across sectors on the market to home hours ratio, sectoral employment trends for men and women, and the consumption to output ratio as measured in the National Income and Product Accounts. Most of the increase in the market hours to home hours ratio post-1950 can be attributed to the increase in female labor supply, and a majority of the increase in the consumption to output ratio is a result of the increase in market services. Not all market goods are close substitutes with home produced goods. Home produced services such as childcare, care for elderly parents, and meal preparation have substitutes that can be purchased only in the market services sector, such as daycare services, nursing home services and restaurant meals. It has also been documented that post-1950 the manufacturing sector grew at a faster rate than the market services sector, which grew at a faster rate than the home services sector. Taking into account all of these facts, the second chapter of my dissertation asks if differences in total factor productivity growth rates in the home, market services, and goods sectors can generate the shift in employment shares that occurred during this time period for both men and women, while remaining consistent with an increase in the consumption to output ratio during the transformation process.",,,
637,The Fulness of the Gospel: Christian Platonism and the Origins of Mormonism,"Scholars have long wondered about the source of Mormon doctrines, many of which differed significantly from the Protestantism that dominated Joseph Smith's environment. In 1994 John Brooke's Refiner's Fire proposed that Joseph Smith drew on Renaissance ""hermeticism"", esoteric beliefs influenced by the antique Corpus Hermericum. Mormon scholars criticized Brooke, often arguing for ancient connections inaccessible to Smith, while scholars of Western esotericism argued that the concept of hermeticism was problematic and that the esoteric ideas labeled hermetic were actually Platonic. This dissertation argues that Smith's quest to restore what he called ""the fulness of the gospel"", or the complete truth that was missing from contemporary churches and even the Bible itself drew from the thought of Christians influenced by Plato and is best understood as a form of Christian Platonism. Thus, for Smith, ""the fulness of the gospel"" included the restoration of divination, the central Christian-Platonic doctrine, as well as the rites and priesthood offices needed to achieve it. Though Smith would not have designated himself a Christian Platonist (most Christian Platonists would not have either), he gravitated towards such ideas, which were available to him through a variety of routes, including popular forms of religiosity embraced by his family; the views of key followers; and the scholarship of his day as summarized in histories, encyclopedias, and other reference works. Viewing Joseph Smith's folk practices, utopianism, temple rituals, soteriology, marital practices, and political ambition through a Christian-Platonic lens allows us to see underlying connections that make intelligible many disparate and peculiar aspects of early Mormonism.",,,
638,The Missing Link in the History of Islamic Legal Theory: The Development of Us&dotbelow;u al-Fiqh between al-Shafi'i and al-Jas&dotbelow;s&dotbelow;as&dotbelow; during the 3rd/9th and Early 4th/10th Centuries,"I trace the lineage of the debates found in al-Fus&dotbelow; ul fi-al-us&dotbelow;ul by al-Jas&dotbelow;s&dotbelow;as&dotbelow; (370/981) to earlier works and debates within the century and a half in question to earlier sources. Three sets of sources were examined in this research. The first set consists of a number of manuscripts that have either being ignored by modern scholars or been under-studied as works relevant to the history of usul al-fiqh. The second set of sources are works in various fields of the religious sciences, including but not limited to works on fiqh, kal am, hadith, and tafsir, which contain scattered information relevant to the study of us&dotbelow;ul al-fiqh. The third set of sources consists of citations from the scholars of the 'gap' period found in the later literature of usul al-fiqh as well as biobibliographical sources. The 3rd/9th and 4th/10 th centuries witnessed significant developments in Islamic intellectual history. Most of the hadith collections that later came to be recognized as canonical were compiled in this period and the major schools of law and certain theological schools also completed their formation during the same period. Despite this continuous progress in other fields of religious sciences, there is an unusual lapse of time between what is widely considered the first work in us&dotbelow;ul al-fiqh (Islamic legal theory) al-Risala by al-Sh afi'i (204/819), and what is recognized as the second work al-Fus&dotbelow;ul f i-al-us&dotbelow;ul by al-Jas&dotbelow;s&dotbelow; as&dotbelow; (370/981). Due to the absence of a major work devoted solely to us&dotbelow;ul al-fiqh from this period, the majority of contemporary scholars considered it as a period of history during which there was little or no intellectual activity in the field of us&dotbelow; ul al-fiqh and where no significant developments took place. This assumption has driven some scholars to assign a new starting point for the field of usul al-fiqh and even different definitions of us&dotbelow; ul al-fiqh. The question of what in fact took place during this 'dark period,' however, has not been fully or adequately explored. This dissertation attempts to provide an answer to this question and to shed light on the development of us&dotbelow;ul al-fiqh during this period. It argues that the ostensible 'gap' (or absence of scholarly production) between the years (204/819) and (370/981) in the field of us&dotbelow;ul al-fiqh (Islamic legal theory) is in fact illusory. The years mentioned here are the death year of al-Sh afi'i, the author of al-Ris ala, often reckoned to be the first treatise in us&dotbelow;ul al-fiqh and the death year of al-Jas&dotbelow;s&dotbelow;as&dotbelow; (370/981), the author al-Fus&dotbelow;ul fi-al-us&dotbelow; ul, the next independent treatise in the field. The presence of a gap may be defended only if understood in the sense of the absence of an independent extant work in the category of us&dotbelow; ul al-fiqh. Based upon the results of this examination of extensive documentation, this dissertation argues that the 'gap' period, rather than a one in which no important developments took place, should instead be viewed by scholars as a ""period of independent productivity,"" where the scholars of the time contributed to the topics of us&dotbelow; ul al-fiqh without a strict school affiliation. I have restricted the topics presented in this dissertation to the discussions of the primary sources of Islamic law due to the predominance of these issues in the documentation examined. The dissertation therefore consists of four chapters. The first chapter deals with the evolution of the concept of us&dotbelow;ul to us&dotbelow; ul al-fiqh. I examine the topics that were included within that rubric by first tracing the transformations of the term during the gap period and then by comparing al-Shafi' i's al-Risala and al-Jas&dotbelow;s&dotbelow; as&dotbelow;'s al-Fus&dotbelow;ul. The subsequent three chapters examine the discussions of the period over the use of khabar al-wah&dotbelow;id (solitary report), ijma' (consensus), and qiyas (analogy) as sources of authority for Islamic law. I chose these three issues because the legal theoretical discussions intensified around these topics during this period, and they later came to be considered among ""the fundamental sources of Islamic law."". The dissertation makes significant new claims about the early development, function, and definition of us&dotbelow;ul al-fiqh in the period between al-Shafi' i and al-Jas&dotbelow;s&dotbelow;as&dotbelow; that contradict commonly held opinions.

639,Optimal Control and Coordination of Small UAVs for Vision-based Target Tracking,"When employing two UAVs, one can fuse vision-based measurements to improve the estimate of the target's position. Accordingly, the second part of this dissertation involves determining the optimal control policy for two UAVs to gather the best joint vision-based measurements of a moving ground target, which is first done in a simplified deterministic setting. The results in this setting show that the key optimal control strategy is the coordination of the UAVs' distances to the target and not of the viewing angles as is traditionally assumed, thereby showing the advantage of solving the optimal control problem over using heuristics. To generate a control policy robust to real-world conditions, we formulate the same control objective using higher order stochastic kinematic models. Since grid-based solutions are infeasible for a stochastic optimal control problem of this dimension, we employ a simulation-based dynamic programming technique that relies on regression to form the optimal policy maps, thereby demonstrating an effective solution to a multi-vehicle coordination problem that until recently seemed intractable on account of its dimension. The results show that distance coordination is again the key optimal control strategy and that the policy offers considerable advantages over uncoordinated optimal policies, namely reduced variability in the cost and a reduction in the severity and frequency of high-cost events. Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are relatively inexpensive mobile sensing platforms capable of reliably and autonomously performing numerous tasks, including mapping, search and rescue, surveillance and tracking, and real-time monitoring. The general problem of interest that we address is that of using small, fixed-wing UAVs to perform vision-based target tracking, which entails that one or more camera-equipped UAVs is responsible for autonomously tracking a moving ground target. In the single-UAV setting, the underactuated UAV must maintain proximity and visibility of an unpredictable ground target while having a limited sensing region. We provide solutions from two different vantage points. The first regards the problem as a two-player zero-sum game and the second as a stochastic optimal control problem. The resulting control policies have been successfully field-tested, thereby verifying the efficacy of both approaches while highlighting the advantages of one approach over the other.",,,
640,The Dark Side of Rome: A Social History of Nighttime in Ancient Rome,"Chapters three and four explore how night separated people by status and identity. The third chapter considers the slave experience at night. Sketching the problems night posed to masters, I argue that slaveholders were more concerned about where their slaves were than keeping them busy. Because masters desired to keep their human property accessible at all hours, many slaves spent their nights inactively confined. The fourth chapter examines how beds marked Roman identity. Where one slept separated the civilized from uncivilized, the rich from the poor, and the manly from the effeminate. This dissertation explores nighttime in Ancient Rome. Although several monographs on the history of night have appeared in the last two decades, no one has focused on antiquity. Through the examination of literary sources from the second century BCE to late antiquity from histories, biographies, plays, novels, laws, art, archaeology, and theological treatises, this dissertation examines how Romans experienced and thought about night. Chapters one and two argue that night intensified emotions. The first chapter examines how Romans constructed the nocturnal soundscape. The change from day to night altered the meaning of some sounds. Other sounds induced more anger, fear, excitement, and even divine transcendence than they did during the day. The second chapter explores a reoccurring complaint Romans made about nighttime: it imprisoned them. The chapter charts how nocturnal boredom divided Romans: virtuous from reproachable, literate from illiterate, laborer from leisured. Nocturnal boredom led to creativity for some and trouble for others.",,,
641,The Development of an aza-Piancatelli Rearrangement,"Nitrogen containing compounds are ubiquitous in nature, and this element plays a critical role in the biological activity of many useful compounds. The essential role of nitrogen has dictated the need for new methods for constructing organic compounds containing carbon-nitrogen bonds. The present work describes our efforts to develop new reactions that form new carbon-nitrogen bonds through the development of an aza-Piancatelli rearrangement, which is a new method for the construction of a variety of trans-4-amino cyclopentenones from readily available 2-furylcarbinols. Activation of furylcarbinols under acidic conditions initiates a cascade sequence that results in nucleophilic attack by nitrogen onto furan and ultimately terminates by way of a 4pi conrotatory electrocyclization. The electrocyclization step is stereospecific giving products with defined trans stereochemistry on the newly produced cyclopentenone ring. The Piancatelli rearrangement can be considered complimentary to the Nazarov reaction for the formation of substituted cyclopentenones, however with the former being largely underdeveloped with respect to the nucleophilic partner that is incorporated into the final compound. We have utilized lanthanide triflate Lewis acids, which are part of a class of Lewis acidic salts of rare earth metals, to enable the usage of amine nucleophiles with the Piancatelli rearrangement. Challenges were encountered during further developments using the aza-Piancatelli rearrangement due to inherent limitations of the original furylcarbinol system. These limitations were overcome by the utilization donor-acceptor cyclopropanes which act as an entirely new activation platform for the rearrangement. This new activation platform acts as a masked carbocation and does not suffer common side reactions such as elimination or Friedel-Crafts alkylation reactions that can be problematic using traditional furylcarbinol starting materials.",,,
642,"Sex, Science and Hermaphroditism in Early Twentieth-Century Japan","This project uses the optic of hermaphroditism to examine late nineteenth and early twentieth century investigations of sex in Japan. It explores the role that scientific thinking played in rooting identity in the body rather than within a web of social interactions and in setting female in opposition to male at a cellular level. This codification of maleness and femaleness as essential, inalterable, and filterable through a prism of science contributed to the fact of sex being brought increasingly within the totalizing domain of medicine. As the modern project to scientifically delineate the sexes ran into obstacles, it led to a fascination with those individuals whose sex could not be definitively classified. This dissertation seeks to illuminate this phenomenon by examining hermaphroditism and ambiguous sex at four sites. The first chapter explores broader theoretical issues by looking at the intersection of sex and nation-state through the prism of the conscription exam. The second chapter examines the creation of the disorder-concept of hermaphroditism (han'in'yo) within the Japanese medical establishment. Chapter three looks at attempts to delineate the sexes by examining the efforts of sexologist Sawada Junjiro to create a science of sexual difference. The final chapter analyzes Miyatake Gaikotsu's 1922 book Hannannyoko (Thoughts on Hermaphroditism) and situates it within contemporary concerns about the convergence of male and female.",,,
643,Enabling Wide-Scale Computer Science Education through Improved Automated Assessment Tools,"There is a proliferating demand for newly trained computer scientists as the number of computer science related jobs continues to increase. University programs will only be able to train enough new computer scientists to meet this demand when two things happen: when there are more primary and secondary school students interested in computer science, and when university departments have the resources to handle the resulting increase in enrollment. To meet these goals, significant effort is being made to both incorporate computational thinking into existing primary school education, and to support larger university computer science class sizes. We contribute to this effort through the creation and use of improved automated assessment tools. To enable wide-scale computer science education we do two things. First, we create a framework called Hairball to support the static analysis of Scratch programs targeted for fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students. Scratch is a popular building-block language utilized to pique interest in and teach the basics of computer science. We observe that Hairball allows for rapid curriculum alterations and thus contributes to wide-scale deployment of computer science curriculum. Second, we create a real-time feedback and assessment system utilized in university computer science classes to provide better feedback to students while reducing assessment time. Insights from our analysis of student submission data show that modifications to the system configuration support the way students learn and progress through course material, making it possible for instructors to tailor assignments to optimize learning in growing computer science classes.",,,
644,Distributed Tracking and Re-Identification in a Camera Network,"For object tracking in overlapping camera views, we propose a strategy for inducing priors on the scene specific information and explicitly modeling object appearance. Contextual information such as known trajectories and entry/exit points will be leveraged as scene specific priors. A novel probabilistic multiple camera tracking algorithm with a distributed loss function for incorporating scene priors is proposed, which leads to a significant improvement in the overall tracking accuracy. The proposed algorithm is validated with extensive experimentation in challenging camera network data, and is found to compare favorably with state of the art trackers. For non-overlapping views, a novel graph based model is proposed to represent spatial-temporal relationships between objects for search and retrieval tasks. A graph ranking strategy is used to order the items based on similarity with an emphasis on diversity. Extensive experimental results on a ten camera network are presented. The proposed person re-identification methodology is compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms in benchmark datasets. This dissertation addresses the challenges in large scale deployment of wide-area camera networks and automated analysis of resulting big data. Analysis of such data is limited due to communication bottlenecks and low computational power at individual nodes. Specific focus is on distributed tracking and search/retrieval.",,,
645,Experimental apparatus for the study of Faraday waves on time-varying domains,"A variation of a classical fluid dynamics experiment on Faraday waves is motivated by interest in understanding pattern formation on time-dependent domains. In the classical studies, a fluid layer when vibrated vertically will generate standing waves known as Faraday waves. To investigate the effect of a time-varying domain on Faraday waves, a vibrating fluid container with dimensions which can be controlled in a time-dependent fashion was designed and constructed. This thesis covers the design of an experimental apparatus and the application of a measurement technique for use in future studies.",,,
646,You restore me : The restoration effects of connection on ego-depletion,"In Study 2, I examined whether a connection writing task assigned every 3 days for 10 days would decrease ego-depletion, restore self-regulation, and reduce stress after a the 10 day study. Participants completed a daily diary study where they completed either a connection writing task or a neutral writing task every three days for ten days. Every night for the ten days, they completed surveys measuring their ego-depletion, self-regulation, and perceived stress. They also completed a checklist of behaviors that required self-regulation. The connection writing task compared to the neutral writing task did not have a significant effect on self-reported ego-depletion, self-regulation, or depleted behaviors at the end of the study. There was; however, a marginally significant effect of the connection writing task compared to the neutral writing task on perceived stress. Participants who completed the connection writing task perceived less stress at the end of the study than participants who completed the neutral writing task. Overall results from these studies did not support the hypotheses. The discussion focuses on potential factors affecting the study, limitations, alternative models, and future studies. Self-regulation is necessary to adaptive social functioning; however, resources to maintain self-regulation are limited. In two studies, I examined whether social connection can restore self-regulatory resources and reduce ego-depletion. In Study 1, participants were randomly assigned to a depletion or no depletion manipulation, which was followed by one of three restoration prime conditions: neutral, connection, or positive emotion. They then completed a Stroop task where their reaction times were measured. Compared to the no depletion condition, participants were slower on the Stroop incongruent trails when they were depleted. Although the patterns of results were in the predicted direction, the connection prime did not significantly reduce ego-depletion when compared to the neutral and positive emotion primes.",,,
647,Xeno-Free Derivation of Retinal Pigmented Epithelium from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells,"Therefore, a novel, biomimetic, xeno-free RGD-containing copolymer designed for cell culture was investigated and found to support healthy hESC cultures and permit their differentiation into functional RPE. These stem cells and hESC-RPE demonstrate similar gene expression, protein localization and phagocytic function as cultures grown on a xenogeneic substrate. The second obstacle pertains to the intense time requirement needed to differentiate hESCs into RPE. Therefore, we recapitulated the signaling events during early embryonic development to expedite the production of hESC-RPE from 1-3 months to 14 days. However, this protocol employs full length recombinant growth factors and animal derivatives. These components represent a challenge in employing these cells as therapies due to the risk of exposure to non-human immunogens. Preliminary work to replace the xenogeneic substrate and recombinant growth factors with small molecules is presented. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly and is characterized by the death of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), the cell layer located behind the retina. The RPE maintains the health of the primary cells responsible for vision, the photoreceptors. As AMD progresses, the RPE degrades, which causes the death of the photoreceptors and a debilitating loss of sight. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can generate a limitless source of RPE for cellular therapies, therefore efforts to derive RPE from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to graft into AMD patients are under development. This thesis addresses two of the obstacles that hinder the production of these therapeutical cells. First, to manufacture cells for clinical use, it is desirable for procedures to be performed under defined conditions free of non-human reagents (xeno-free). These pilot studies demonstrate that a xeno-free substrate and dual-Smad inhibition via small molecules can rapidly and efficiently differentiate hESCs into a population of cells expressing a pigmentation marker. These studies contribute to the development of defined, xeno-free methods for cellular manufacture which can further the translation of stem cell therapies to the clinic.",,,
648,Modeling Eye Tracking Data with Application to Object Detection,"Since human attention is biased towards faces and text, in the first work we propose an approach to isolate face and text regions in images by analyzing eye tracking data from multiple subjects. Eye tracking data is clustered and region labels are predicted using a Markov random field model. In the second work, we study object extraction in videos using eye tracking prior. We propose an algorithm to extract dominant visual tracks in eye tracking data from multiple subjects by solving a linear assignment problem. Visual tracks localize object search and we propose a novel mixed graph association framework, inferred by binary integer linear programming. In the final work, we address the problem of predicting where people look in images. We specifically explore the importance of scene context in the form of object co-occurrence and camera focus. The proposed model extracts low-, mid- and high-level and scene context features and uses a regression framework to predict visual attention map. In all the above cases, extensive experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform current state-of-the-art. This research focuses on enhancing computer vision algorithms using eye tracking and visual saliency. Recent advances in eye tracking device technology have enabled large scale collection of eye tracking data, without affecting viewer experience. As eye tracking data is biased towards high level image and video semantics, it provides a valuable prior for object detection in images and object extraction in videos. We specifically explore the following problems in the thesis: 1) eye tracking and saliency enhanced object detection, 2) eye tracking assisted object extraction in videos, and 3) role of object co-occurrence and camera focus in visual attention modeling.",,,
649,Automated and Interactive Segmentation Methods for 5D Microscopy Images,"Accurate segmentation of cells and tissues in 5D (3D + time + multiple channels) microscopy data is critical in quantitative developmental biology. This is a challenging task due to the large volumes of data, e.g. tens of gigabytes for single time lapse 3D sequence, and the inherent characteristics of microscopy image acquisition. In this research we develop new supervised and unsupervised segmentation methods with a focus on application to morphogenesis. Third, we introduce an interactive segmentation and analysis tool for 5D microscopy data, called CellECT. An adaptive confidence measure, called cellness metric is used to highlight regions of uncertainty in the segmentation. This metric quantifies how much a segment deviates from a typical correct segment. This metric adapts to the dataset and learns from the user interactions. The proposed methods are validated on an ascidian time-lapse 3D volume data. CellECT is distributed as an open source software and is used in other quantitative biology applications. Second, we develop a principled approach to unsupervised segmentation and fusion of multiple segmentations. A linear optimization framework is proposed for the joint correction of multiple over-segmentations obtained from different methods. The main idea motivating this approach is that over-segmentations, from a pool of methods with various parameters, are likely to agree on the correct segment boundaries, while spurious boundaries are likely to be method or parameter-dependent. First, we briefly explore the approach of correcting an over-segmented volume by using a trained model. The proposed method automatically initializes with seeds according to the local density of cells in the volume. Next, this algorithm merges pairs of super-pixels based on a learned model using a feature representation which effectively discriminates between spurious and correct boundaries.",,,
650,Hyper(in)visibility : Reading Race and Representation in the Neoliberal Era,"In the current neoliberal moment, black bodies are more visible than they have ever been in both politics and popular culture. The visual field is saturated with images of blackness. However, hollow stereotypes often accompany these images and the multifarious nature of black humanity remains invisible. Despite the fact that black bodies are present in films, on television and in new media spaces, black subjectivities are nowhere to be found. I call this simultaneous hypervisibility and invisibility, hyper(in)visibility. The white gaze, or the knowledge that one is viewed through the lens of these stereotypes, further magnifies the issue of hyper(in)visibility for black people. In order to better understand how hyper(in)visibility works, I examine both mainstream representations of black people as well as self-representations, including filmic, televisual and digital media texts. I analyze the production, reception as well as the texts themselves to examine how hyper(in)visibility inscribes itself in each process. I argue that productive challenges to hyper(in)visibility turn away from the white gaze and look within.",,,
651,"From Tower to Bower : Constructions of Gender, Class, and Architecture in Middle English Literature","The architectural theory of access analysis contends that the deepest spaces of architecture, those that take the most architectural steps to reach, are the highest status spaces in an architectural structure. Aristocratic women were placed in these spaces both historically and in the literature of medieval England. Gaining access to these spaces and to the female bodies that inhabited them thus conferred status on the men who were lucky enough to do so. Social status was highly fluid and often contested in high to late medieval England. The highly charged tower with its association with high status therefore became a site around which social status could be contested. In this dissertation, I examine how authors whose status was contested---the cleric and the civil servant---manipulated the trope of the entowered woman to negotiate their own status. I do so by first situating the tropes as part of a real, historical understanding of castle architecture, rather than as part of an allegorical program. I then build on New Historicist theories that imagine the text as entering contemporary social conversations, but I further those theories by following so-called New Materialists, who argue that objects can have material effects in the historical world. Following Pierre Bourdieu, I consider texts not just as art qua art, but commodities jockeying for status in an economic and social world. I bridge the divide between discursive, ideological ""effects"" theorized by New Historicists and the material effects of what I consider to be the complex assemblage of the text, which is not reducible to the physical material of the text or the discursive/linguistic ""matter"" of the text. I argue that texts are a special kind of commodity, one in which the labor of the maker, the author, is not abstracted in the exchange process. The text, as it circulates via manuscript, carries with it, in the linguistic signs on the page, the intention of the author. As male authors imaginatively accessed the high status space of tower and its female occupant in the literature they produced, they thus made a radical claim for increasing their own social status. The dissertation concludes with a consideration of the women of the historical Paston family, who serve as a counterpoint to the ubiquitous trope of the entowered woman, as they chose to live in the lower status architectural program of the gentry manor house, where women were not relegated to the inaccessible space of the castle tower. Starting with the Biblical Song of Songs, architectural structures of the castle and tower have served as a metaphor for women's bodies. Throughout the Middle Ages, this metaphor continued to stand in for the female body, emphasizing a desire in the cultural imagination that the female body should be impenetrable, their sexuality carefully controlled. With the advent of castle architecture in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the castle tower also became metonymically linked with the female body as women historically occupied this deepest---that is, the most architecturally inaccessible---space of the castle. This dissertation considers the trope of the female body entowered in romance, Middle English lyric, Geoffrey Chaucer's Book of the Duchess, and in the Paston letters.",,,
652,Three Essays in Behavioral Economics,"The third chapter advances a simple beta--delta model of quasi-hyperbolic time preferences. In this chapter, the theoretical model is used to construct the key variables from our data. This data was collected in the field by my co-author, when she visited the islands of Bonaire and Curacao in 2010. While much of the data is survey response or demographic related, the last part of each interview includes a paid experiment to elicit time preferences over various time horizons. We find that, controlling for key demographic factors, decreased patience (lower delta) and present bias (beta < 1) are associated with an lower willingness to adopt marine reserve restrictions, but they have no effect on attitudes about gear restrictions. This dissertation concerns two key topics in behavioral economics: bounded rationality and hyperbolic time preferences. While these two topics do not have much in common, per se, the analyses presented here do contain unifying themes. Each chapter focuses on issues pertaining to public economics. The environments are often characterized by strategic interaction, in that each individual's choices affects the welfare of others. In such cases, economic efficiency is by no means guaranteed. The first two chapters examine environments with multiple Nash equilibria, which limits predictions. I utilize Quantal Response Equilibrium, which relaxes the assumption of pure best-response in favor of noisy best response. This allows me to make comparative static predictions across group-size, information completeness, payoff-type, and state of the world; predictions that are problematic under pure best-response. I conduct laboratory experiments for the threshold game (chapter one) and the market entry game (chapter two). I find that much of the seemingly anomalous behavior observed in the data is easily explained using QRE. This suggests that quantal response is a useful alternative assumption to best-response in coordination problems, and, in particular, logit QRE is a valuable equilibrium model of coordination failure with simple economic intuition.",,,
653,LATTE : A ground-based telescope for measuring the Milky Way Galaxy below 10GHz,"Advancements in CMB research has brought about not only a new age of precision cosmology, but also galactic astrophysics. WMAP has uncovered some tantalizing questions about the nature of dust emission in the galaxy, and has provided glimpses of a potentially new mechanism for energizing cosmic rays in the region around the center of the galaxy. The LATTE telescope has a single 9GHz receiver, Dicke switch radiometer operating at 30Hz, with a proven temperature uncertainty of under 10mK per switch cycle. The high sensitivity is due to a low noise cryogenic HEMT amplifier and a low loss cryogenic PIN diode switch. Using the optical design of the BEAST experiment, LATTE maps the microwave sky with an angular resolution of _ 1.5 degrees covering about half the sky in one 24 hour period. In this document the expected and actual performance are reviewed, and preliminary pseudo-maps are presented.",,,
654,Italian Teachers' Intercultural Pedagogical Strategies in Multicultural Classroom,"Italian socio-cultural landscape has changed dramatically in a relatively short time (since the early 1990s). Due to the influx of immigrants and the changing demographics of classrooms, teachers are faced with pressure to adapt to the classroom environment and the pressures from the Italian educational bureaucracy. The pressures generated by these environmental factors have been particularly acute due to the absence of adequate resources. This research study focuses on the classroom changes in the context of the regional and larger Italian societal changes, addressing the increasingly significant problem of teaching in a multicultural classroom environment. This study employed ethnographic methods of data collection and analysis employing qualitative, open-ended interviews to examine teachers' perspectives on their everyday practices, actions, and reactions to multicultural changes in classroom environments in central Marche Region. Regional, national, and European policy documents were collected for the analysis. Analysis of policy documents revealed complexity and changeability in mandates under conditions of inadequate resources and additional demands on their time. Faced with the realities in their classrooms, teachers adapted to the rapid changes by drawing on their own creativity, developing various methodologies to approach the cultural other, such as songs and personal stories. These pedagogical tools were multi-dimensional in terms of their positive effects on the students, which included reducing stereotypes - beyond ethnocentricity -- and strengthening student empathy, among others. Other important meta-themes were improved sense of self, students as researchers, and students as resources. These meta-themes support important over-arching themes related to intercultural pedagogy, the valorization of diversity and student engagement. A common unifying theme was identified that teachers who were involved in successfully engaging students were themselves strongly engaged.",,,
655,"Sovereign, Shaman and Bodhisattva : A Medieval Reinterpretation of Empress Jing in the Hachiman gudkun","Empress Jingu (traditionally 169-269 CE) is a legendary figure, appearing in myths of the gods in the earliest chronicles of Japan, the Kojiki (712) and the Nihon shoki (720). According to these accounts, she was a shaman as well as empress and the vessel through which the gods made known their will to the emperor. At Emperor Chuai's death, she took up the divine mission bequeathed to her husband and organized an invasion of the Korean peninsula, calling on the gods whenever her goal was frustrated. She returned triumphant to Japan, bore a son, and ensured his succession to the throne through her own period of rulership. Though the paucity of historical evidence has led to various theories regarding the story's factual basis, its importance as a legend is evident from its appearance and reinvention through over a thousand years of Japanese history. This thesis charts what may perhaps be considered the first phase of that reinvention. In the later classical and medieval periods of Japan, Jingu's son, Emperor Ojin, was identified with Hachiman, a local god of increasingly central importance and an emblem of syncretic religious traditions within Japan. With the growing importance of Buddhism, both Hachiman and his mother were reimagined with Buddhists elements in their histories. Focusing on the Hachiman gudokun, a shrine-temple origins account written in the first decades of the fourteenth century, this thesis charts the developments of the Jingu narrative in various documents of the medieval period. Highlighting three key roles of Jingu's character--ruler, shaman, and Buddhist--I show how the Hachiman gudokun presented a version of Empress Jingu's story revitalized by contemporary developments in Buddhist and political thought, paving the way for the powerful martial image of Jingu that emerged during the Meiji Period.",,,
656,Expanding the Arsenal : Developing Novel PhotoCORMs and Delivery Systems Tailored for Biological Applications,"Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenously produced bioactive small molecule whose biological role has not yet been completely elucidated. It has, however, been implicated in having anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and wound healing properties, as well as a dose-dependent cytotoxicity. To exploit these properties, a reliable method to deliver CO must be developed. A key requirement of any pharmaceutical agent is that it must be able to deliver its drug to a specific target in a controllable fashion, and a CO releasing moiety (CORM) is no different. Photochemical activation is uniquely suited for this application because it provides excellent control over the timing, dosage, and location of CO release. This work presents several novel approaches using group VII metal carbonyls as photoCORMs that are each uniquely well-suited for use in biological applications. One multi-functional complex incorporates luminescent properties so that it can both serve as a photochemical CO releaser and as an imaging agent to help elucidate the fate and transport of photoCORMs in biological systems. Another system incorporates a NIR harvester, enabling photochemical activation at biologically suitable wavelengths while also providing an in vivo imaging agent. This work also introduces a novel photoCORM delivery framework capable of indirect activation using long-wavelength red light and can hijack existing immune system responses to effectively deliver the photoCORM to biological targets. To be used as a pharmaceutical agent, a photochemical CO releasing moiety (photoCORM) must exhibit certain desirable properties, all of which revolve around their biological compatibility. They must be stable to air and water in the dark, soluble in aqueous media, and photochemically active with red or near-infrared (NIR) light where light penetration is maximized in biological systems. Ideally, they would also exhibit some targeting properties, enhancing their role as pharmaceutical agents. Metal carbonyls are ideal photoCORMs because their photochemistry is well understood and can be controlled easily. However, photochemical CO release from these complexes is notoriously wavelength dependent and typically requires UV or near-UV activation, wavelengths that have minimal biological transmission.",,,
657,"From the ""Phaedo"" to the ""Timaeus"" : The Continuity of Plato's Metaphysics of Causation","I argue for the basic continuity of Plato's account of causation, from the Forms-as-aitiai hypothesis of his middle period to the teleology of his late period. Against the prevailing view, according to which the Timaean teleology amounts to a retraction of the Phaedo's account of aitiai, I contend that in the Timaeus the metaphysical status of physical properties and processes remains essentially the same as it had been in Plato's middle period, when he first takes up the question of the relations among what Aristotle would go on to call ""formal"", ""material"", ""efficient"", and ""final"" causes. Against authors such as Gill, Annas, Fine, Mueller, Sedley, and Johansen, I argue that Plato has not elevated the explanatory status of efficient causes in the Timaeus, though he does, for the first time, take up the subject of natural philosophy and its epistemological status in a thorough way, which does mark a contrast with his middle period. We know of regular connections among properties from a priori cases. In Chapter Four I explain how the understanding of the Forms-as-aitiai hypothesis fits into the teleological natural philosophy of the Timaeus, contrasting my own interpretation with those put forward recently by Sedley and Johansen, inter alia. In Chapter Five I take up the reconstructionist interpretation of Timaeus 49c7-50b5, as developed by Cherniss, Lee, and Silverman, and I argue that this reading, and it's import for the metaphysical status of particulars, helps us to understand the relation between metaphysics of causation and natural philosophy in Plato's late period. To this end, in Chapter Two I explore some respects in which I believe it can be shown that the discussion of anamnesis at Phaedo 59a-95e sets the stage for the Forms-as-aitiai hypothesis. That discussion provides an account of how we can be justified in the belief that concomitance of properties in the natural world points the mind to an underlying, purposive order. Evidence acquired through the senses alone could not justify such an inference; the Phaedo's discussion of anamnesis emphasizes, however, concomitance of properties among certain kinds of geometrical objects, objects of pure thought. In the apprehension of these regularities, perception does not play a justificatory role, it only prompts the recollection. The Phaedo's discussion of the Forms-as-aitiai hypothesis then mixes a priori and a posteriori examples, in order to bring out the justification for teleological inferences to a rational order underlying the flux of phenomena. The discontinuity thesis, though it has always been influential in Plato scholarship, often rests, I find, on a certain interpretation of the Phaedo's Forms-as-aitiai hypothesis, an interpretation that is open to some significant objections. Against the interpretation of the Forms-as-aitiai hypothesis according to which Plato intends, in the Phaedo, to put forward Forms as efficient causes, Gregory Vlastos argued for a ""deflationary"" interpretation which, vi arguably, better coheres with Plato's broad metaphysical premises. In Chapter Three I defend and extend Vlastos's argument, replying on Vlastos's behalf to later work on the topic. My aim is, as well, to place the debate over the Forms-as- aitiai hypothesis in the broader context of the long-standing debate over the place of natural philosophy in Plato's thought.",,,
658,Discovery of disease-associated antibody biomarkers and their binding targets using bacterial displayed peptide libraries,"Applying three quantitative screening strategies against a set of PE and healthy-outcome pregnancies (HOP) identified unique disease-associated antibody binding peptides from a fully random 15 amino acid peptide library. With a two-color screening method, we used antibody fractions enriched from plasma to isolate significantly PE cross-reactive and specific peptides distinct from a previously identified PE-associated antibody specificity. We used a panel of these antibody-detecting peptides to train and validate an Adaptive Boosting classification algorithm that achieved high specificity (95%) and a validated overall 80% diagnostic accuracy. To more closely replicate the native antibody binding environment, a second screening method used unprocessed, diluted plasma. This approach sequentially enriched peptides binding to PE antibodies and removed HOP antibody binders, resulting in a strong consensus motif that we further expanded through directed evolution. Importantly, we linked this motif to a region of a common viral antigen, Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1, and a human G protein-coupled receptor, GPR50, presenting a novel case for molecular mimicry. Thus, this method enabled unbiased identification of a disease-associated antibody and characterization of its targets. Finally, we developed and applied a unique methodology that combines bacterial displayed library screening with next-generation sequencing to profile the antibody repertoire of individual PE patients and HOP samples. This analysis re-identified the viral antigen-linked motif among several distinct PE- and HOP-associated antibody specificities, providing broader insights into alterations to the immune repertoire in PE. This work demonstrates the utility of screening bacterial displayed peptide libraries to profile the antibody repertoire and identify new markers of disease. These disease-associated antibody-detecting peptide reagents enable development of molecular diagnostics and discovery of antibody binding target(s) to improve understanding of disease etiology and potentially elucidate therapeutic targets. Discovery of biologic molecules specific to a diseased state, or biomarkers, can lead to diagnostic development, therapeutic target identification, and improved understanding of disease pathogenesis. Antibodies remain an attractive class of biomarkers given their amplification by the immune system, stability, and current clinical use. While the antibody repertoire represents a rich source for biomarker discovery, it has been difficult to impartially identify which molecules from this repertoire are associated with disease. This work demonstrates three molecular discovery processes centered on the utility of bacterial displayed peptide libraries and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for identifying novel antibody biomarkers and their targets. We applied these methods to discover and characterize disease-associated antibodies for pre-eclampsia (PE), a condition with unknown etiology that affects 5-8% of pregnancies, using an unbiased approach.",,,
659,"Employed Graduate Student Mothers : The Benefits, Challenges, and Perspectives of Women Fulfilling Student, Family, and Worker Roles","A rising number of students are pursuing graduate degrees while working and parenting young children. Gender differences in the experience of multiple roles are well-known, and graduate school and childbearing years tend to overlap. This study sought to discover how employed graduate student mothers (GSMs)---women fulfilling work, academic, and parenting roles---experience, perceive, and meet the demands of their multiple roles. Some of the work-family literature has explained the interface between the work and family domains using two contrasting perspectives (i.e. role conflict and role enrichment), and it is now known that role occupants can experience both conflict and enrichment throughout the course of meeting multiple role demands. The participants in the study were concurrently involved in the roles of parent of one or more preschool child(ren), graduate student (MA, EdD, or PsyD), and (full- or part-time) employee. Each woman completed a brief, structured demographic questionnaire and participated in a one-on-one, semi-structured, open-ended interview. A case-oriented, cross-case analysis using inductive and deductive methods was conducted. The findings indicated that employed GSMs experienced both challenges and benefits in the course of fulfilling student, family, and work role demands. However, an overall perspective of conflict or enrichment appeared to be related to the experience of role overload and certain student and family role factors, including the employed GSM's position in her graduate program, the role management technique she used, and the age(s) and number of her child(ren).",,,
660,"Design, Fabrication, and Characterization of High Performance III-V nMOSFETs for VLSI Beyond Si-CMOS Scaling Limit","The revolution of the silicon VLSI technology during the past several decades has been ultimately driven by the goal of miniaturization, which leads to an increase in switching speed as well as integration density and a reduced power consumption. As the device size in VLSI has nearly approached its physical limit in the last few years, the industry and academia have been actively evaluating some of the emerging technologies as an alternative to the classical Si-based metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistors (MOSFETs). Among them, III-V compound semiconductor based transistors are being considered as one of the viable candidates for the future VLSI at scaling generations beyond 7 nm-node. The low electron effective masses in III-V semiconductor materials (i.e. InGaAs) provide superior electron transport properties such as high electron velocity and mobility. According to ballistic transport calculation results, InGaAs based channel devices can potentially exhibit a 1.5 times higher drive current (> 2 mA/mum) even at a lower supply voltage (VDD < 0.7 V) over the Si counterparts. Thus, for faster and smaller integrated circuits with reduced power consumption, III-V based transistors may be the solution to VLSI beyond the physical limitations encountered in scaling of the conventional Si-based MOSFETs. With the abovementioned key design considerations in mind, InGaAs based raised S/D quantum-well MOSFETs have been developed using S/D regrowth as well as the substitutional-gate (i.e. gate-last) scheme. By adopting this device structure, any process-induced damage at the semiconductor/dielectric interface is reduced, and heavily doped S/D is readily formed in a self-aligned manner. Recently, III-V MOSFETs with a record performance have been reported through this work, by implementing sub-1 nm EOT high-k dielectrics with a low interface trap density and adopting an optimized device structure to suppress the off-state degradation at the short channel lengths. A device with a gate length of 18 nm has shown a 3.0 mS/mum peak transconductance (gm) at VDS = 0.5 V, which is the highest peak gm from any reported field-effect transistor performance. A device with an ultra-thin channel and thick vertical spacer at a gate length of 25 nm exhibits an excellent performance in both the on-state and off-state, featuring 2.4 mS/mum peak g m, 77 mV/decade minimum subthreshold swing at V DS = 0.5 V, 76 mV/V drain-induced barrier lowering, and 500 muA/mum on-current at a fixed 100 nA/mum off-current and VDD = 0.5 V. This is the highest on-current from any reported III-V-based MOSFETs and is comparable to state-of-the-art Si-Fin- and nanowire- FETs. In comparison with calculation results obtained from a ballistic FET model, it has been found that the fabricated devices with Lg = 25 nm are operating nearly in the ballistic limit. In order to achieve device performances close to the idealized target, several critical requirements must be met. Firstly, the high-k gate dielectric must be ultra-thin (equivalent oxide thickness < 0.5 nm) and nearly defect-free (interfacial trap density < 1012 /cm2-eV). Hence, any high damage inducing process is not allowed, and surface passivation techniques must be carefully developed. Secondly, the epitaxial layer design should be optimized, especially since there is a trade-off between the on- and off-state performances associated with the channel thickness as well as indium content. Thirdly, S/D regions must be very heavily doped in order to avoid potential source starvation and to minimize the contact resistivity. Furthermore, this heavy doping must not extend more than 1-2 nm below the depth of the channel to avoid degradation of the short-channel characteristics. Lastly, the device must be highly scalable. To satisfy the tight integration density requirement in VLSI, the gate length and contact pitch should be less than 14 nm and 30 nm, respectively. To achieve this, S/D must be very close to the gate, i.e., self-aligned.",,,
661,Scalable approaches to communication and inference : Minimalistic strategies for measurement and coordination,"Recent advances in technology have enabled large-scale systems in a wide variety of settings. We consider three examples which illustrate that by carefully reducing the size of problem from the very outset, we can provide efficient solutions to the engineering difficulties of communication and inference at scale. The second problem we consider is that of geographic routing in mobile ad hoc networks. In order to forward a packet, a relay node needs position estimates of its neighbors and the destination. When the number of nodes in the network grows, the overhead required to inform far away nodes of changes in one's position overwhelms the network. We address this problem by directing updates to only a small subset of nodes in the network. Accordingly, we give a routing protocol that accommodates scenarios where the source and/or relay nodes do not have estimates of the destination's location. The protocol parameters are chosen to guarantee that the overhead fits within network resources and to ensure that the length of every routing trajectory is bounded within a constant factor of the shortest path. We verify these analytical design prescriptions using simulations. The third problem is an exploration of the value of time for efficient inference on Twitter. Twitter as an online social medium is defined by its real-time nature. We therefore ask whether interests (e.g., sport fandom) can be identified from a user's tweet times alone by exploiting the known timing of ""events"" associated with the interest (e.g., game times of the sport team). Our results indicate that tweet times can be used to make reliable inferences on the interests of a large number of users. With a view to automate event identification, we develop an inference framework with minimal measurement (time of tweets) and processing requirements for accurately determining when a topic trends on Twitter from an aggregate Twitter feed related to the topic. We then dissect the identified trending times into groups, each associated with a different subtopic, using only userIDs of tweets made during trending times based on the intuition that when two events/trending-times share a large fraction of users, they likely correspond to the same subtopic. Our results from Twitter data obtained over six months illustrate that significant insights into topic-specific Twitter activity can be obtained within our frugal measurement and processing framework. These results suggest that time can be a compact and effective cue to cull data from massive online streams like Twitter. The first example we provide is the problem of estimating a small number of continuous valued parameters from a high dimensional signal. Random projections have been shown to be effective in capturing sparse signals with few measurements. We study the effect of random projections for parameter estimation by focusing on two lower bounds on estimation error variance, the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB) and the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). They reveal that when we ensure that certain geometries (shapes) in the signal manifold (the set of all possible values that the signal can take) are preserved, these bounds are also preserved up to an SNR penalty equal to the dimensionality reduction factor. We show how the SNR penalty results when viewed in conjunction with the threshold behavior of the ZZB can be used to accurately predict the minimum number of random projections needed to avoid large estimation errors. We take up the problem of frequency estimation to illustrate the above ideas and give: (i) number of random projections needed to preserve the identified geometries and (ii) an algorithm which attains the CRB when the number of random projections exceeds the ZZB based prediction.",,,
662,Asian American Military Service and the Reconceptualization of American Citizenship,"Findings from the dissertation show that prior to the complete expansion of Asian immigration and naturalization policies in 1965, military service via draft or voluntary enlistment brought positive values to Asian American veterans and their ethnic community. First, since veterans are unequivocally entitled to naturalization rights, military service gave many Asian American veterans the claims they needed for legal citizenship when the U.S. government did not accept any other reason for naturalization. Second, the dissertation demonstrates that throughout the 20th century, experiences in the U.S. Armed Forces have often provided a ""narrative of deservingness"" for Asian Americans in the assertion of socio-political rights in courts and legislatures. Additional findings from the project show that enlistment, even today, provides a means of upward mobility through the usage of the G.I. Bill for post-secondary education for Asian American veterans. Finally, the research shows that work in the military helps create a heightened sense of American identity. With a few exceptions, the (re)socialization effects of military service are significant to the socio- political incorporation of immigrants in terms of promoting a stronger national identification. This research, however, also considers racially discriminatory practices within the military. The findings show that the impact of the racialized experiences, for some, was the impetus for their activism in anti-war and social justice movements in the late 1960s and 1970s. For others, racism experienced during their time of service sowed the seeds for their lack of trust in and disengagement from the U.S. political system. The disconnect between the rhetoric of the ""good"" citizenship-soldier and the lack of equal treatment by the U.S. government exposed a racialized aspect of American citizenship. How can military service help to (re)define the concept of citizenship for U.S. ethnic/racial minorities? Since military service has functioned to both incorporate and alienate racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, this dissertation investigates the socio-political incorporation process of Asian Americans through military service. Bringing together in-depth interviews, veteran oral histories, census data, survey data, and secondary research, this project assesses whether service in the U.S. Armed Forces has helped to expand the legal and substantive concept of citizenship for Asian Americans in the United States. Ultimately, this project provides a nuanced understanding of not only the Asian American military experience, but also an advancement in the expanded meanings of American citizenship.",,,
663,Testing the Affect Model of Social Comparison (AMSC) : Emotional and Behavioral Implications of Viewers' Shifting Comparisons to Transforming Media Targets,"Past research on social comparison and media has not explored how comparisons shift over the course of a program, or more specifically, how different comparison directions alter audiences' affective states and behavior. Using an experimental design that manipulated comparison direction by exposing participants to the beginning and/or the ending of a weight loss reality program, the present study found mixed support for a newly proposed Affect Model of Social Comparison (AMSC). As predicted, different comparison directions contributed to specific emotions and health behaviors. Those who made more upward health comparisons felt more envy, which in turn contributed to increased health behavioral intent. Hope was also identified as an indirect mediator in the upward health comparison-health behavioral intent relationship. Further, upward comparisons led individuals to consume more healthy snacks, and downward comparisons led individuals to consume more unhealthy snacks. This experiment indexes the importance of discrete emotions in social comparison processes, and highlights the need for research on nuanced comparison behavior that evolves as characters evolve.",,,
664,The Political Impact of Agenda Setting and Framing : A Comparative Study of the English and Spanish American Media,"The purpose of this research is to consider media effects among groups exposed to different language media. It focuses on Hispanics, as they are one of the largest growing segments of the population in the United States. Using a mixed method approach, this project incorporates both qualitative and quantitative analysis to analyze the differences in framing and agenda setting between Spanish and English language media and the effects this might have on different language media consumers. A content analysis and comparisons of a cross-national sample of Spanish and English newspaper sources on both salient and non-salient political issues shows there are notable differences in how information is covered. Additionally, survey research shows different political opinions among Hispanics in the United States that consume this different language media, even when controlling for such things as partisan identification. While the connection between the media and opinion formation is not entirely clear, this research presents a new, more diverse approach to media studies that helps us further disentangle this relationship. In addition, it suggests there are differences in opinion formation that are attributable to differences in framing and agenda setting.",,,
665,The Art of the Show Window : The Role of Fine Art and Artists in the Formation of the Department Store and its Displays,"The role of fine art and artists in the history of department stores is largely understudied within the literature surrounding nineteenth and early twentieth century American consumer culture. Addressing this omission in the literature, this thesis positions artists, as well as fine art more generally, as central to the institutionalization and development of the department store within the modern American consumer landscape. Focusing on the department store window as a central location for the intersection of fine art and consumption through an art historical lens, I will explore the impact of the visual and spatial transformation of these consumer spaces on the formation of gendered identities within American consumer culture. Examining Saks Fifth Avenue and its collaboration with Alexander Archipenko as a case study within the history of American department stores, I demonstrate the fundamental ways in which artists' transformations of the department store impacted modern American consumers' interactions with these retail environments. Through shoppers' experiences with the department store as a location for the production and consumption of fine art, American consumers were simultaneously encouraged and obligated to use art as a means for signaling a modern consumer identity.",,,
666,"Urban Strangers : Representations of Migrant Workers in Contemporary Chinese Literature, Film, and Popular Culture","My research has two primary goals: (1) to provide a new insight into narrative traditions in Chinese cultural history, and establish a preliminary framework for migrant narratives by laying out representative works, writers, and filmmakers of this narrative mode, and (2) to further delve into various recurring themes and motifs about migrant workers in literature, film and TV from the 1980s to 2011, discussing the cultural, social and political significance of the narrative in contemporary China. The latter will be the major focus of my dissertation. I argue that in addition to the rural and the urban narratives, there is another important narrative mode---migrant narrative, centered in traditions of modern Chinese cultural history. This previously unaddressed narrative mode focuses mainly on spatiality and translocality, and needs to be understood primarily as spatial stories, for its main focus is mobility and transformation in spaces and places. Thematically, it usually explores material changes and emotional experiences in the places and locations through which notions of identity, individual expression and belonging are transformed. In Chinese cultural tradition, there is a classic division between rural narrative and urban narrative. However, the emergent social, economic and cultural phenomenon of migrant workers in the post-Mao period has challenged this binary system of rural/urban narratives. Traditionally, the study of the rural narrative has focused on works describing village life and peasants, and therefore has not regarded texts of rural-urban migration as its main research target. Similarly, the study of the urban narrative has focused on works of city life and urbanites, in particular middle-class intellectuals and youth of Generation X, and thus also has excluded stories of rural migrants from its field. As a result, a large body of literary and cinematic texts about rural migrants has been left out of the realm of research. My dissertation aims to clean out such a space for the previously unaddressed narrative mode, and attempts to bridge the gap between the two existing cultural traditions.",,,
667,Estimates of Hydrologic Properties in Upper Ocean Crust of Juan de Fuca Ridge Eastern Flank Using Sulfur Hexafluoride Gas Tracer in Cross-Hole Multi-Scale Injection Experiment,"The first detection of an SF6 patch south of the injection source apparently contradicts the prior hypothesis that crustal fluid is flowing northward from Grizzly Bare to Baby and Mama Bares, but there are extensive leaks in Hole 1301A, which may have inadvertently pulled SF6 southwards. CORKs 1301B and 1026B are also leaking hydrothermal fluid, and any data collected from these holes should be interpreted carefully. Both 1362A and injection Hole 1362B are operating as intended with no known leaks, although a discharge valve was opened at 1362B in 2011 and closed in 2013. Following this perturbation to the flow field, the 1362A valve was opened in 2013 and then closed in 2014. Tracer was detected in both 1362A and 1362B from the beginning of sampling in 2013, one year after injection. The mean tracer concentration for Holes 1362B and 1362A was 4.6 nM and 4.5 nM, respectively. The sustained signal at these CORKs suggests a hovering of an SF6 patch spanning at least 311 meters in the region. The detection of a considerable amount of tracer to the north at 1362A is consistent with the hypothesized SW-NE fluid flow direction. The hydrogeological fabric at our site appears to be heterogeneous, with fluid transport occurring through small, isolated permeable zones found in the upper volcanic portion of the ocean crust. A tracer injection experiment was performed in 3.5 Myr old seafloor comprised of sediment-buried abyssal hills oriented N20E, and located 100 km east of the Endeavor Segment of the Juan de Fuca spreading ridge in the northeastern Pacific. In the summer of 2010, a mixture of tracers (metal salts, dissolved sulfur hexafluoride [SF6], microspheres) was injected into the crust via borehole 1362B as part of a 24-hour injection experiment during IODP Expedition 327. Fluid samples were subsequently collected from 1362B, and from four additional holes (1026B, 1362A, 1301A, and 1301B) located 300 to 550 m away from the injection hole. The borehole array penetrates a hydrothermal fluid flow system thought to be flowing from SW to NE along a buried abyssal hill often referred to as Second Ridge (SR). Hydrothermal flow is thought to be controlled by a series of exposed volcanic outcrops located along the same buried hill. According to the hypothesis, recharge of bottom seawater occurs through Grizzly Bare, an exposed outcrop 52 km south of the borehole array, and discharge seeps through Baby Bare and possibly also Mama Bare outcrops, which are both located within 5 km to the existing boreholes. The goal of this study is to test hypothesized fluid flow direction, flow velocity and crustal permeability using the conservative gas tracer SF6. Two small cylinders of SF6 were injected at a fluid pumping rate of 6.7 L/s for 20.2 hours, resulting in a mean concentration of 47.6 microM or 47,600 nM (total of ~23 mol of SF6 was injected). Borehole fluid was continuously sampled in 1.8 mm ID copper tubes using osmosamplers (OS) from each of the long-term, subseafloor observatories (known as CORKs) that had previously been installed in the boreholes. The OS spools were recovered using the ROV Jason in 2011 and 2013. Following recovery, fluid samples were transferred into evacuated vials for measuring SF6 via gas chromatography in a shore-based laboratory. Results of samplers recovered in 2011 indicate the first arrival of injected SF6 ~305 days after injection at Hole 1301A, located 550 m south of the injection Hole 1362B. This suggests that the mean lateral transport of tracer is ~1.8 m/day (660 m/yr), a rate at the upper end of previous upper crustal fluid flow velocity estimates.",,,
668,Interfacing Defect Qubits with Nanophotonics in Silicon Carbide,"To demonstrate their use in real devices, we designed, fabricated, and characterized photonic crystal cavities in 3C silicon carbide thin films with mode volumes of less than (lambda/n3 and Q's as high as 1,500 with integrated Ky5 defects. Additionally, we performed simulations and analysis of the fabricated structures using observed structural imperfections to determine that the Q's are likely limited primarily by the non-vertical structure sidewall angle. Despite the modest Q's of these structures, they can be utilized to generate large local field intensities to enhance optical interactions with Ky5 qubit states within the cavities. We accomplish this by performing cavity enhanced photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy on cavity modes tuned to the zero phonon line of the defects and observe large (as high as 30 times) increases in the luminescence and optically detected magnetic resonance signals originating from the defect states and approximately 2x faster rates of ground state spin initialization. In addition, we use these techniques to probe the photoluminescence dynamics of the Ky5 defects' optical pumping cycle, perform excitation wavelength dependent studies of spin and spectral inhomogeneity, and use the small mode volume and narrowband photoluminescence enhancements of the cavities to observe spectrally distinct subensembles of defects with linewidths as narrow as 25 GHz within the inhomogeneously broadened zero phonon line. Although much is still unknown regarding the properties of these defects, they show great promise as a candidate system for defect qubit based quantum devices and technologies. Defect based qubit systems like the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond have recently emerged as promising candidates for quantum technologies due to their combination of long coherence times, room temperature operation, and robust optical interface. In order to realize many of their proposed applications, defect qubits must be incorporated into scalable devices architectures consisting of photonic, mechanical, or electrical degrees of freedom. Despite much recent progress, many challenges remain for diamond growth and device fabrication. As an alternate approach, we engaged in a search for nitrogen vacancy center analogues in alternative materials with the hope of obtaining a greater degree of control over defect and material properties. Ultimately, we discovered that divacancy-related point defects in all three of the most common forms of silicon carbide- termed 4H, 6H, and 3C- act as analogues to the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. We chose to focus our research primarily on defects in 3C silicon carbide (termed 'Ky5' defects) because of its availability as a single crystal heteroepitaxial thin film grown on silicon, an advantage that greatly facilitates the fabrication of functional devices. We characterized the spin and optical properties of Ky5 defects in thin film geometries and observed many similarities to the nitrogen vacancy center. We performed the first measurements of spin dynamics in 3C silicon carbide and demonstrate coherent control of defect spins up to room temperature and observe coherence times of up to 22 microseconds.",,,
669,Information Propagation on Social Networks,"We found that the static network structure alone is not sufficient for explaining hashtag adoption among users in the Twitter social network, and our result suggest that a user-centric model would be more appropriate for this task. We propose a model for individual social media users, termed a genotype, which is a per-topic summary of a user's interest, activity and susceptibility to adopt new information. We show that the genotype framework is capable of accurately quantifying the adoption behavior of individual users with respect to hashtag topics. Many models of disease and rumor spreading phenomena average the behavior of individuals in a population in order to obtain a coarse description of expected system behavior. For these types of models, we determine how close the coarse population-level approximation is to its corresponding agent-based system and discuss the accuracy of the population-level approximation. We apply these theoretical results to real social network data to see how well they describe the contagious nature of social phenomena. Specifically, we consider hashtag adoption data collected from the Twitter social network. To assimilate the Twitter data to a simple contagion model, we developed and implemented statistical learning methods to construct an adaptive state estimator for systems described by nonlinear stochastic differential equations.",,,
670,Automatic Model Reductions for Stochastic Simulation,"Based on those results, we proposed an automatic model reduction framework for stochastic simulation. It consists of two parts: a model reduction detection algorithm and a model reduction application algorithm. The model reduction detection algorithm uses an adaptively weighted Petri net to dynamically identify opportunities for model reductions for both the SSA and tau-leaping simulation, with no requirement of expert knowledge input. The model reduction application algorithm automatically applies model reductions that are both valid and beneficial. Results are presented to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of both algorithms in the context of tau-leaping. Stochastic simulation has been an important tool to study the inherent stochasticity in the dynamics of cellular biochemical systems. Multiple time scales in cellular chemically reacting systems present a challenge for the efficiency of stochastic simulation. Numerous model reductions have been proposed to accelerate the simulation of chemically reacting systems by exploiting time scale separation. However, these are often identified and deployed manually, requiring expert knowledge. This is time-consuming, prone to error, and opportunities for model reduction may be missed, particularly for large models. To meet this challenge, we studied and examined the validity criteria and efficiency gains of different model reduction techniques for different simulation algorithms. Specifically, we compared the validity conditions and efficiency gains of Michaelis-Menten model reduction applied to both SSA and tau-leaping algorithms. Results show that although the condition for validity of the reduction is the same for both algorithms, the reduction results in a substantial speed-up under a different range of conditions for SSA than for tau-leaping.",,,
671,"Transformation and Connection through Art Song and Jake Heggie's ""The Starry Night""","Desire for and expertise with connecting with the audience is a priority in professional performance but was not the priority in student venues while perfecting technical skill. However, the transition to professional status requires a performer's deep understanding and expressive capability. Performing in such a way that this happens in a mutually satisfying manner for performer and audience is the definition of artistic success. Heggie's song cycle inspires a deep reflection on the vocation, the problems and potential solutions in a song artist's journey. The genesis of Heggie's The Starry Night, a song cycle for mezzo-soprano and piano on texts of Vincent Van Gogh, Anne Sexton and Emily Dickinson, was inspired by a personal event in Heggie's life. While each of the authors of the texts have contributed significantly to art and poetry, their personal lives give inspiration to others who share similar types of suffering. Each analysis of the songs explores the text and the composer's musical treatment. The author and soprano Elizabeth Croy coached the cycle with Jake Heggie and his personal interpretations of the texts and music, as described on February 23, 2010, are recorded in this document. Entertainment has changed dramatically in recent decades. The frequency of live music making and live performances of all genres has significantly declined. These changes reach deep into the heart of classical vocal music. This study examines present concerns in art song performance as its enthusiasts recognize the necessity to employ innovative approaches in order to continually share their art form. All people involved in performing or in educating others to perform this genre are reexamining its relevance in society. Some have reached a new conviction that art song is important. Those who have observed evidence of its decline seek ways to rejuvenate audiences for this beloved and transformative art form. Establishing an authentic connection with the audience, utilizing art song as true theatrical entertainment, and removing lenses that would alienate audiences are each essential. Jake Heggie is a composer who offers a relevant artistic contribution to society and reinvigorated hope for contemporary opera and art song. His significant collaborations speak of his ability to work successfully in theatrical productions and his enthusiasm to educate students about this rewarding vocation.",,,
672,Shaping the Urban Community : Convivial Conversations and the Display of Pieter Bruegel the Elder's Religious Paintings,"In summary, my dissertation offers a new and coherent reading of a major, albeit previously understudied, body of works of a leading sixteenth-century artist, and explains them as intrinsic to the processes of demographic, confessional, and economic changes of the urban body. By focusing on the multitude of functions and applications of Bruegel's biblical images, I challenge the interpretations of mid-sixteenth-century Netherlandish art as increasingly secularized because of the contemporary Protestant suppression of religious images. Instead, I offer a positive narrative, one in which Bruegel's paintings testify to the success of the contemporary artistic quest for a novel idiom of non-devotional and non-confessional Christian art, and prove visual arts' ability to advance period socio-economic and religious discourses to the advantage of the entire community. Each chapter examines a different aspect of the engagement of Bruegel's paintings with Antwerp's contemporary transformation. Chapter One advocates for the understanding of the Tower of Babel, displayed in the suburban villa of an affluent entrepreneur Niclaes Jonghelinck, as a pictorial argument on the precedence of collective welfare over individual profit. By approaching the panel as an epitome of the role of visual arts in sparking convivial conversations, this chapter also introduces some of the main premises from which I proceed in my dissertation. The study of the unprecedented popularity of the images of the Conversion of Saint Paul, presented in Chapter Two, continues my interest in period discourses of entrepreneurship, but analyzes them as inseparable from confessional and legal circumstances. This chapter reveals that models of the community envisioned by Antwerp's citizens and their Spanish rulers were at odds, and draws from this observation two conclusions pertaining to the paintings of the Conversion. First, that their display served the purpose of the confessional self-fashioning of collectors, and second, that the contemporary elite began to actively question the uniform Catholic orthodoxy enforced by the Spanish Habsburgs as a necessary precondition for the commercial and cultural success of the community. Chapter Three takes the transformation of religiosity as its main subject, and introduces the Procession to Calvary and the Sermon of Saint John the Baptist as proxies of those changes. Demonstrating that Bruegel thematized in these two compositions religious and artistic shifts towards discursivity, I analyze convivium and open-air Protestant sermons as vehicles for the contemporaneous redefinition of religious ritual, removed from the official supervision of the Catholic Church, and relocated to the alternative space of private houses. This dissertation analyzes the emergence of a novel idiom of biblical imagery in the oeuvre of Pieter Bruegel the Elder in response to Antwerp's profound religious, demographic, and economic transformation. I distill the major innovative characteristics of Bruegel's religious paintings, such as his focus on the narrative, compositional complexity, and design for semi-public domestic spaces to show that in privileging those qualities, Bruegel introduced discursivity as the alternative to the devotional and liturgical functions of religious art. Correlating those changes in religious imagery during this period with Antwerp's transformation into an international commercial metropolis, I argue that Bruegel's biblical compositions became active instruments in negotiating the conditions of common welfare and consensual harmony. By analyzing the correspondence of the Antwerp elite, inventories, humanistic treatises, and extant pictorial examples of domestic decoration, I further make the case that the images' role in promoting social and economic cohesion was stimulated by their incorporation into the custom of learned dinner conversations (convivium).",,,
673,Modeling and Finite Element Simulation of Dielectric Elastomer Materials and Actuators,"Finally, the continuum theory of solid dielectrics is used to construct a rigorous finite element method for the simulation of quasi-incompressible dielectric elastomers subject to combined non-uniform electromechanical loading, and high levels of electric field and deformation. This method is intended to assist in the assessment of performance and electromechanical integrity of DEAs and smart materials. The constitutive laws described above, including the deformation dependent permittivity and elastic stiffening of dielectric elastomers, form part of the material library. Some model problems for DEAs are solved to demonstrate the ability of the finite element method code to correctly evaluate the effects of material and geometric non-linearities for a given material constitutive law. This theory is general in the sense that it is valid for conservative/ non-conservative materials, and encompasses different material types, i.e. piezoelectric, dielectric, or electrostrictive. Moreover, the constitutive response of the materials to combined electromechanical loading is left to be determined by experiments. Next, the methods of statistical mechanics are utilized to model the hierarchical, and statistical, features of the different material scales present in the structure of dielectric elastomers. In this manner, models for the deformation dependent permittivity and elastic stiffening of dielectric elastomers are constructed. It is found that both of these material features, prominent and concurrent in some dielectric elastomers subject to large levels of deformation, have very important implications in the electromechanical stability, dielectric breakdown and fracture of DEAs. The fast and soft elastic response of thin dielectric elastomers to electric stimulus has established these materials as a paradigm for the development of a technology of low cost, lightweight, high energy density storage, large deformation elastomer actuators (DEAs) and smart materials. These features result in a very significant technology that permits the manufacture of actuators, and smart materials in a wide variety of configurations for applications spanning a wide range of scales. Furthermore, this technology could potentially revolutionize many aspects of consumer devices, energy conservation, and environmental impacts. The present dissertation is concerned with the modeling and simulation of dielectric elastomer materials, two important issues concerning the understanding, and further development of DEAs, and smart materials. First, a thermodynamic analysis is presented to construct the continuum theory of deformable dielectrics.",,,
674,Harnessing the Power of Furfuryl Cations : The Aza-Piancatelli Rearrangement and Beyond,"The value of the aza-Piancatelli rearrangement has been highlighted by the synthesis of an hNK1 inhibitor and by efforts toward the total synthesis of homoharringtonine, a pharmaceutical drug approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Additionally, a Piancatelli rearrangement of macrocyclic furylcarbinols, to be applied to the total synthesis of coralloidolide F, has been explored. Inspired by Piancatelli's rearrangement of furylcarbinols with water to form 4-hydroxycyclopentenones for the synthesis of prostaglandins, we explored the rearrangement with amine nucleophiles to access valuable 4-aminocyclopentenones. The product-forming cascade is initiated by dysprosium trifluoromethanesulfonate, a relatively underdeveloped Lewis acid catalyst. Activation results in the formation of a furfuryl cation (oxocarbenium ion) that is intercepted by an amine nucleophile and terminates in a 4pi conrotatory electrocyclization establishing the observed trans-stereochemistry. The chemistry was initially developed with aniline nucleophiles, and was later extended to substituted hydroxylamines. Mechanistic investigations of the aza-Piancatelli rearrangement have shown that an off-cycle binding of the dysprosium catalyst and the amine nucleophile controls the rate, as observed by a Hammett plot. However, the selectivity of the rearrangement is determined by the ability of a nucleophile to efficiently capture the oxocarbenium ion upon its formation. Finally, chiral phosphoric acids such as (R)-TRIP have been found to be catalysts for the aza-Piancatelli rearrangement capable of inducing enantioselectivity. This is the first example of asymmetric cascade rearrangements of its kind. The ubiquity of amine functional groups in all of nature as well as a large majority of pharmaceutically active molecules makes methodologies capable of quickly constructing carbon-nitrogen bonds invaluable. Reactions capable of constructing these highly desirable bonds in addition to introducing molecular complexity are highly sought-after. Therefore we set out to develop a novel cascade rearrangement of furylcarbinols, a sustainable starting material, to 4-aminocyclopentenones, the aza-Piancatelli rearrangement.",,,
675,Multiscale Methodologies and Simulations of Emergent Self-assembly Phenomena,"Atomic scale interactions, although short-ranged, none-the-less, result in emergent phenomena that scale several orders of magnitude in both length and time. The development of tractable computational means of studying self-assembly, while retaining atomic-scale physics is a challenging problem that has seen decades of research efforts directed at it. In this dissertation, I apply a recently developed coarse-graining framework based on an informatics quantity known as the relative entropy to develop coarse-grained models of peptides. I use these models to study the thermostability and self-assembly behavior of peptides near an interface, and to develop rational design principles for modulating the structures they form. Further, I implement a larger-scale coarse-graining technique to elucidate the underlying cause of emergent chiral lattice structures in systems of quasi-2-dimensional colloidal particles, and put forth a general framework for designing colloidal particles that form chiral self-assembled phases. This dissertation applies powerful coarse-graining strategies to elucidate bottom-up design principles that have tremendous applicability to the development of biotechnologies and advanced materials.",,,
676,Stochastic Modeling of System Function in a Network of Biological Oscillators,"It was observed in SCN tissue and in the SCN stochastic model that the oscillator is less likely to shift phase in response to a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) dose at circadian time (CT4) than at other times. A reexamination of the behavior of the SCN as a whole, when modeled as linked stochastic oscillators, led to the hypothesis that the cells of the SCN synchronize to each other using a ''phase tumbling'' process. Our hypothesis is that the SCN synchronizes by its cells shifting with a wide phase distribution when they are perturbed at phases not near CT4. Rather than shifting in a deterministic manner, where all the cells stay synchronized and shift together to a new light schedule, they instead temporarily desynchronize then reorganize aligned to the new light/dark cycle. Within a few cycles the system can rapidly shift to a new light schedule. This rapid re-entrainment to both new light/dark and temperature schedules was confirmed in mice by first desynchronizing the SCN using a neuropeptide that has been considered a synchronizing agent, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, or by a brief bright light exposure before exposing the animals to a new shifted schedule. Finally, since the behavior of the SCN as a whole may depend on the network topology of its intercellular connections, we applied an information theoretic measure to infer pairwise functional connections between neurons in the SCN. We first validated the method on several model networks. After inferring connection networks of three SCN's, we modeled those networks in our stochastic SCN model and confirmed that we could re-infer the bio-inspired networks. We found that the SCN, at least for these experimental samples, appears to have a small-world network topology and is scale-free. We hope that our results have helped to illuminate how stochastic fluctuations in the SCN system contribute to its behavior. Though many existing deterministic models contain details of the gene regulation in the cell, their output has been compared to the behavior of the SCN as a whole, rather than to individual cells. Characterizing properties of individual cells such as period, phase, and synchronization is challenging due to their non-linear and unstable oscillations. We developed a wavelet analysis method to characterize cell behavior in biological experiments and compare with stochastic cell models. This analysis led to an examination of how period distributions could be influenced by stochastic fluctuations in a nonlinear cell oscillator model, and a hypothesis that the poor or strong oscillators observed in biological experiments could be a stochastic oscillator operating near a bifurcation point, between non-oscillatory and oscillatory conditions. Many living organisms have evolved to anticipate daily circadian cycles and changing seasons of their environment. In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, a brain region of about 20,000 neurons, serves as the master circadian clock coordinating timing throughout the body and entraining to daily external light cycles. The remarkable precision of the SCN clock relies on intercellular signaling. In its absence, each SCN neuron and the SCN as a whole have significantly less stable oscillations. Though there are candidate signaling neuropeptides and anatomical surveys of the SCN, it is still unknown how the SCN as a whole responds to changes in the environment and regulates function in the body. We model the unstable oscillations in individual cells by developing a stochastic model based on the cell clock's gene regulatory network, then investigate the intercellular signaling properties of the SCN to understand its behavior as a whole.",,,
677,"Regeneration, Remodeling, Regression : Vascular Biology Insights from the 3Rs of Botryllus schlosseri","These insights will support future vascular biology studies and have established Botryllus as a model for the 3Rs of vascular biology. Here we present our insights from the 3Rs of the Botryllus vasculature. Our insights into vascular regeneration include using a novel vascular cell lineage tracing methodology to assess regeneration in parabiosed individuals to demonstrate that the source of regenerated vasculature is due to the proliferation of pre-existing vascular resident cells and not a mobile progenitor (Chapter II). In our studies of remodeling we show that Botryllus expresses an orthologue of the angiogenic Tie receptor, not expressed in vasculature tissue but rather phagocytic cells involved in somatic tissue remodeling (Chapter III). Finally, we utilize the unique biology and experimental accessibility of Botryllus to investigate the role in which ECM modifying enzymes such as Lysyl Oxidase (LOX) play in maintaining vascular stability, demonstrating that inhibition of LOX allows for the induction of vascular regression (Chapter IV). The dysfunction of the vascular system underlies more than 70 diseases that affect over 1 billion people worldwide. The molecular, cellular, and developmental mechanisms that govern the vascular system can be categorized as the 3Rs of vascular biology: regeneration, remodeling, and regression. While the importance of the 3Rs in regulating homeostasis is widely accepted many aspects of the biological processes of the 3Rs are unknown or not well understood due to the experimental inaccessibility of vascular tissue in most organisms. Here we investigate the 3Rs of vascular biology exhibited by the experimentally accessible and easily manipulated extracorporeal vasculature of the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri. Ascidians such as Botryllus can be found in shallow waters and harbors throughout the world and are considered to be the closest non-vertebrate relatives to the vertebrates. Botryllus has been the focus of numerous genetic, developmental, and regenerative studies including studies of asexual development, stem cell parasitism, allorecognition, and angiogenesis. Using the unique biology of Botryllus we have further developed this animal as a novel model for vascular biology, deriving insights into all 3Rs of vascular biology.",,,
678,"'Now on Sea, Now on Land' : Venice's Piazza San Marco","A sense of spatial expansiveness develops, born from an increasing ease with being a water-based state, from the eleventh century on, evidenced in a redefinition of the Piazza San Marco in terms of its connection, both physically and ceremonially with the lagoon. Shifting from the ninth and tenth century concerns with the definition of perimeters and the need for defense of the lagoon, what emerges, in tandem with growing Venetian trade, is an emphasis on the Piazza representing the city-state as an imperium. Already a more amorphous entity to define because of the city being surrounded by the lagoon, it is only step away to begin to identify with more distant bodies of water. At first at ease within the Po and Brenta river networks, the Venetians expand to establish control of the upper Adriatic followed by their dominance in the entire area of the sea. From its inception as a small apron-space in the ninth century to the thirteenth century's enlarged and ornamented civic square, how has the Piazza San Marco been used and how has it served a variety of people's interests? If examined over time, can its transforming contours and usage contribute to an historical study of how Venetians saw themselves and imagined their city relating to the larger world? What is uncovered, in the historical view of it as a civic space, is that priorities and values did change according to Venice's perceived relationship to the region and to the Mediterranean world. If the ninth century inception, eleventh century reconstruction, twelfth century expansion, and thirteenth century enrichment of the Piazza are studied, in the light of its physical amendments and its usage, it is apparent that Venetian ideas about limits, borders and boundaries are transforming. It is only a matter of time and of opportunity, before dominion is extended to a strategic chain of entrepots in the Mediterranean and mare nostrum, itself, seems an extension of the Venetian lagoon. Methods used in this study included site visits for measurement and observation and the study of archival records and chronicles. Great use was made of reports on the limited archaeological work that has been done on Rive Alto as well as the lively debate and scholarship reflected in the voluminous secondary work. The un-built zones or ""openings"" in the urban fabric of cities change over time, revealing changes in priorities, circumstances and social values. Civic spaces particularly reflect transforming attitudes and commitments. The Piazza San Marco, in Venice, Italy, is a fitting example of an urban zone that has been, up to the present, a pivotal meeting place. As a central site of cultural, social and economic exchange, the Piazza has been in active use from the ninth century.",,,
679,Mild Generation and Novel Reactivity of Nitroso Compounds,"As proposed, the mild oxidation conditions allowed the expansion of nitrosocarbonyl chemistry into new areas, such as the nitroso aldol reaction. Through the synergistic combination of our aerobic oxidation with known Lewis acid activation of beta-ketoesters, the alpha-amination and alpha-oxygenation of carbonyl compounds was achieved for the first time using nitrosocarbonyl compounds. All of the reactions are operationally simple to perform, utilize reagent grade solvents and air as the terminal oxidant, and the only byproduct is water. Recently, we reported the first example of the aerobic generation of nitrosoformate intermediates for use in the nitroso ene reaction. The aerobic oxidation method, which relies on the use of catalytic amounts of CuCl (5 mol %) and uses air as the terminal oxidant, proved mild enough to avoid decomposition of the ene adducts, affording the allylic hydroxylamines in up to quantitative yields. Additionally, the oxidation protocol is highly general for a wide variety of N-substituted hydroxylamines; the Diels-Alder reaction can be carried out in up to quantitative yields employing an array of nitroso compounds. Moreover, by switching to photoredox conditions using Ru(bpy)3Cl2, the nitrosocarbonyl intermediates can be efficiently generated with temporal and spatial control. The development of efficient methods for the formation of carbon-nitrogen bonds is of great interest in organic chemistry. While traditional approaches to C-N bond formation are well developed and have found widespread use, approaches utilizing an electrophilic source of nitrogen are vastly underdeveloped. Although a number of electrophilic sources of nitrogen have been developed, the efforts of our research have centered on the use of nitrosocarbonyl compounds. Due to their high reactivity, nitrosocarbonyl intermediates can only be generated in situ and are classically obtained from the oxidation of hydroxamic acid derivatives using periodate salts. However, this in situ oxidation protocol, which is commonly used in the hetero-Diels-Alder (HDA) reaction, is incompatible with the other reactions because the initially formed adduct is highly susceptible to decomposition. While this has significantly limited the development of chemistry utilizing nitrosocarbonyl compounds, we postulated that if the oxidation conditions were mild enough to circumvent product decomposition, nitrosocarbonyls could be utilized in a wide variety of C-N bond-forming reactions.",,,
680,Estimating Confidences for Classifier Decisions using Extreme Value Theory,"Classifiers generally lack a mechanism to compute decision confidences. As humans, when we sense that the confidence for a decision is low, we either conduct additional actions to improve our confidence or dismiss the decision. While this reasoning is natural to us, it is currently missing in most common decision algorithms (i.e., classifiers) used in computer vision or machine learning. This limits the capability for a machine to take further actions to either improve a result or dismiss the decision. In this thesis, we design algorithms for estimating the confidence for decisions made by classifiers such as nearest-neighbor or support vector machines. We developed these algorithms leveraging the theory of extreme values. We use the statistical models that this theory provides for modeling the classifier's decision scores for correct and incorrect outcomes. Our proposed algorithms exploit these statistical models in order to compute a correctness belief: the probability that the classifier's decision is correct. In this work, we show how these beliefs can be used to filter bad classifications and to speed up robust estimations via sample and consensus algorithms, which are used in computer vision for estimating camera motions and for reconstructing the scene's 3D structure. Moreover, we show how these beliefs improve the classification accuracy of one-class support vector machines. In conclusion, we show that extreme value theory leads to powerful mechanisms that can predict the correctness of a classifier's decision.",,,
681,Specificity and Transfer in Category Learning,"Category learning is an important cognitive process that facilitates decision-making. Over the past few decades it has become clear that there are multiple systems underlying category learning, each with unique advantages. In my research I focused on rule-based and information-integration category structures, which rely on explicit and procedural systems, respectively. One key difference between these two systems is that learning in the procedural system appears to be specific only to the trained context, while learning in the explicit system appears to be generalizable. A study my colleagues and I conducted (Casale, Roeder, & Ashby, 2012) demonstrated that category knowledge could be transferred in rule-based tasks, but not in information-integration tasks. The purpose of this dissertation was to further explore the stimulus-specific nature of procedural category learning and the generalizability of explicit category learning. The results of these experiments showed that learning is not specific to just one or a small group of stimuli in explicit category learning, even when explicit learning becomes automatic knowledge. These results also showed that procedural category learning is highly specific to trained stimuli, even when category knowledge becomes automatic. Finally, these results cannot be accounted for by the effects of either sensory adaptation or perceptual learning.",,,
682,Topics in Modeling and Control of Spatially Distributed Systems,"The second part considers the following problem: for a given plant and cost function, could there be a finite-length periodic trajectory that achieves better performance than the optimal steady state? Termed optimal periodic control (OPC), this problem has received attention over several decades, however most available methods employ state-space based methods and hence scale very badly with plant dimension. Here, the problem is approached from a frequency-domain perspective, and methods whose complexity is independent of system dimension are developed by recasting the OPC problem for linear plants with certain memoryless polynomial nonlinearities as the problem of minimizing a polynomial. Finally, the third part extends results for a special class within spatially distributed systems, that of spatially invariant systems, from systems defined on [special character omitted]2 (square-integrable) spaces to systems whose state space is an inner-product Sobolev space as they arise when considering systems of higher temporal order. It is shown how standard results on exponential stability, stabilizability and LQ control can be generalized by carefully keeping track of spatial frequency weighting functions related to the Sobolev inner products, and simple recipes for doing so are given. This dissertation consists of three parts centered around the topic of spatially distributed systems. The first part treats a specific spatially distributed system, the so-called Rijke tube, an experiment illustrating the unstable interplay of heat exchange and gas dynamics. The experiment is described in detail and it is demonstrated how closed-loop system identification tools can be applied to obtain a transfer function model, before a spatially distributed model is developed and analyzed. The model in its most idealized form can be described in the frequency domain by a matrix of non-rational transfer functions, which facilitates analysis with classical methods such as the root locus.",,,
683,The Effects of Tau Proteins on Microtubule Mechanics and Molecular Motor Transport,"Next, we examined the effects of tau proteins on in vitro transport properties of kinesin-bound cargoes on microtubules. In comparison to the no tau control, kinesin-bound quantum dot cargoes had lower velocity and shorter run lengths in the presence of tau when moving on taxol-assembled microtubules. Most of the single point tau mutants that we tested showed similar slowing of cargo translocation, with speed reductions similar to those observed with WT tau. One exception was the 4R short R406W mutant tau, in which the velocities of kinesin-bound cargoes were significantly lower than in WT case. The disease mechanism for mutant has been particularly puzzling, so our results may suggest a more prominent role in disruption of axonal transport than was previously appreciated. Taken together, studies provide important new insights into how tau proteins and other small molecule stabilizers modulate the mechanical and functional properties of cytoskeletal microtubules and how misregulations in tau may be related to the development of neurodegeneration and dementia diseases. Microtubules are an essential component of the cytoskeleton that provide structural integrity and facilitate important functions in cells. In this work, I will explore several aspects of microtubule mechanics and function using a wide range of biophysical techniques. I am particularly interested in the effects of stabilizing agents, including small molecule inhibitors of microtubule dynamics (such as taxol or epothilone), and microtubule-binding proteins, such as tau. First, using advanced spectral analytical techniques, we studied the effects of tau proteins on the mechanical properties of single microtubule (MT) filaments under controlled in vitro conditions. We found that the short forms of 3-repeat (3R) and 4-repeat (4R) wild-type (WT) tau proteins reduce the stiffness of taxol-assembled MTs compared to a no tau control, despite the fact that the microtubule diameter is known to increase when these tau proteins bind. In contrast, single point tau mutants P301L, R406W and DeltaN296, which are all linked to devastating neurological diseases, do not have significant effects on microtubule stiffness compared to a no tau control, raising interesting questions about possible mechanical origins of tauopathy diseases. Next, we investigated the effects of microtubule-stabilizing chemicals epothilone-A and -B on 1) microtubule mechanics, 2) the transport properties of kinesins and 3) the ability of WT tau proteins modify the stiffness of microtubules assembled with epothilone. We found that microtubules assembled in the presence of epothilone-A or -B were less stiff compared to taxol-assembled MTs, and the addition of WT tau further reduced the stiffness. However, the differences in stiffness/persistence length between epothilone-assembled microtubules and taxol-assembled microtubules diminished after the addition of WT tau. Kinesin translocation speed was sensitive to the type of stabilizing chemical, and the changes in velocity in the presence of tau were also depended on the assembly condition. Epothiolone and taxol compunds are both frequently used in cancer chemotherapies, and our results shed light on the possible molecular mechanisms of neurological side effects (such as debilitating nerve pain) when these agents are used. Lastly, we looked at the effects of tau on intracellular trafficking in COS-7 cells. We found that the microtubule network in the cells were dramatically modified after the introduction of tau via transient transfection, with substantial bundling, aggregation and membrane-association in the presence of tau. However, there were no obvious differences in the microtubule network structures between cells that were transfected with mutant tau and wild-type tau. Interestingly, despite the major modification of the cytoskeletal structures in the presence of tau, the measured velocities of lysosomes in directed transport in cells that were transfected with tau were not significantly different compared to the lysosome velocities in cells with no tau.",,,
684,"Measuring, Understanding, and Controlling Heteroatom Distributions in Layered and Zeolite Boro- and Alumino-silicate Frameworks","Based on the molecular understanding of boron and aluminum siting learned from these materials, a synthesis protocol to control heteroatom siting in zeolite catalysts is proposed using borosilicate zeolite SSZ-70 (B-SSZ-70) as an example. The protocol begins with the preparation of B-SSZ-70 that was delaminated to increase its external surface area for reactions involving bulky molecules, during which boron siting was monitored ex-situ at different synthesis stages. The results show that boron site distributions were retained during the course of post-synthetic treatments. Subsequently, the framework boron species in the delaminated B-SSZ-70 were post-synthetically exchanged with aluminum atoms. Notably, as expected, the reinserted aluminum species are concluded to be located at certain silicate sites on external surface sites. This is very different from the aluminum siting in Al-SSZ-70 (i.e., Al is everywhere ). Overall, these analyses, methods, and synthesis protocols are expected to provide insights into the local environments of heteroatoms and their distributions in zeolite catalysts, which would enable rational zeolite synthesis with engineered heteroatom site distributions. Site-specific heteroatom incorporation imparts catalytic and adsorption properties to silicate-based catalysts (e.g., zeolites and clays), leading to diverse technologically important industrial processes. In such applications, reactions are typically catalyzed at Bronsted acid sites associated with H+ cations that balance the anionic charges near framework heteroatom species (generally aluminum) in heteroatom-containing silicate frameworks. Despite the fact that the catalytic and adsorption properties of these catalysts have been observed to be greatly influenced by several factors, such as heteroatom type, contents, and distributions, the associated fundamental understanding of heteroatom site distributions is still very limited and has been elusive. This is partially due to lack of experimental methods that can probe the complicated order and disorder around heteroatom sites even in well-ordered crystalline silicate frameworks. Among various characterization methods, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can be considered as a promising technique because of its high sensitivity to electronic environments of NMR-active nuclei, which allows their molecular proximities and connectivities to be established. Herein, newly modified two-dimensional (2D) NMR techniques were applied to probe specific covalent site connectivities between framework boron or aluminum heteroatoms and their nearby silicate sites in zeolite and layered boro- and alumino-silicate materials. The established site connectivities, in conjunction with crystallography, enable the determination of boron or aluminum heteroatom site distributions. We applied the new 2D NMR methods to boron- or aluminum-containing surfactant-directed silicates and zeolite SSZ-70, aiming for understanding similarities and differences between boron and aluminum incorporation. Interestingly, boron atoms are shown to be preferentially incorporated into specific silicate sites in most cases, whereas aluminum atoms appear to be non-selectively distributed among different silicate sites in all cases. Such observations may suggest that boron and aluminum species participate differently in the formation of boro- and aluminosilicates, respectively.",,,
685,Theory and Anecdote in Chinese Poetics : the Trajectory of Remarks on Poetry in Song Dynasty China,"This dissertation is about Shihua (""Remarks on Poetry""), a literary genre that arose in the early Northern Song period and became the most widely practiced form of literary criticism throughout the later imperial dynasties. My chronological focus is the three hundred years from 1000 C.E. through the thirteenth century, during which the subject of my dissertation, remarks on poetry, emerged as a new form of literary criticism. Although most of the previous studies were focused on the origins and precursors from which the shihua form came into existence, my purpose is instead to make a tentative exploration of the trajectory of its chronological development occurring in the Song dynasty. The selection of topics in each chapter is guided by my intention to look into every important phase in the development of the genre and to examine its most representative works. It is also my intention to explore the relationship between the shihua genre as a form of literary criticism and the contemporary practice of literary composition, and furthermore, to answer the question of how this relationship helps define the shihua genre in the context of Chinese literary and cultural history in the Song dynasty. Therefore, a comprehensive survey of Song dynasty poetic history will be found in my dissertation as well. My dissertation involves case studies that constitute thorough research on five particular works of remarks on poetry. My conclusion is that although it was Ouyang Xiu's (the first writer of the shihua genre) original intention to create a peculiar literary form that would be independent of the traditional ones to accommodate anecdotal writings and cause them to be circulated among literati as a pastime, the later trajectory of the genre went against his intent. It arises from a humble beginning with fragmentary expressions, but develops systematic and structured argumentation in its full maturity. In the meantime, the narrative portion, originally consisting mostly of anecdotal writings, was replaced by serious theoretical discussion and critical thinking on general statements concerning literary phenomena. Whether good or bad, these transformations reflect the shift of the literati's attitude toward poetry, literary history, criticism, and their response towards ongoing social reforms. They were also the outcome of the interaction between multiple impulses such as sociopolitical vicissitudes and intellectual evolution.",,,

The novelty of three- dimensional, heterogeneously spaced, massive datasets creates numerous computational challenges. In this work, we produce software and methods that build on newly released software libraries to process, compute, and visualize lidar pointcloud data. Our scripts streamline processing of raw lidar pointcloud data through various stages: filtering, classification, visualization, and computation of various topographic metrics (slope, aspect, curvature, etc). We demonstrate the value of computing topographic metrics at the pointcloud level over traditional raster-based approaches and apply our tools to calculate slopes and estimate erosion of the California Channel Islands.",,,
687,"Exploration of the Kinetic Behavior of Redox Mediators, and the Development of a Recyclable Electrolyte with Applications to Synthesis","The present system promises to provide a general solution to problems associated with the use of conventional supporting electrolytes and ionic liquids. The system can be applied to a variety of synthetic transformations, and will undoubtedly find use in a host of other applications that necessitate the use of an electrolyte. In electroorganic synthesis, the generation of a reactive intermediate, e.g., a radical cation or a radical anion, can be achieved either directly or indirectly. In the former, the redox reaction of interest occurs at the electrode, while the latter uses an electron transfer redox mediator to achieve homogeneous electron transfer with the substrate. This electron transfer redox mediator plays a significant role in an indirect electrolysis since it is involved in the heterogeneous (at the electrode) as well as the homogeneous electron transfer step (with the substrate). Indirect electrolysis utilizing the redox mediator offers significant advantages over the direct protocol. As a promising class of organic electron transfer redox mediators, the recently developed triarylimidazoles (TAIs) have been used to achieve indirect electrochemical C-H bonds activation and functionalization. Herein the diffusion and electron transfer rates for the oxidation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol using TAI are reported and compared its electrochemical behavior with that of tris(4-bromophenyl)amine (TBPA), an organic electron transfer mediator that is frequently used for indirect oxidative electrolysis. The results contribute to the understanding of the electron transfer process of electrocatalytic oxidation using TAIs, and offer useful guidelines for their further development and use. Electroorganic chemistry provides a benign and practical approach to synthesis. Unfortunately some applications necessitate the use of large amounts of supporting electrolyte to ensure ionic conductivity and the efficient movement of charge. A major problem stems from the fact that the supporting electrolytes are difficult to separate, and when separated, they are frequently thrown away. To address these issues, a polymeric ionic liquid-Super P RTM carbon black composite has been formulated. The result is a stable electrolyte that enables electrolyses to be performed without adding an additional supporting electrolyte, and that can be efficiently recovered and reused. In addition, the ability of the composite to modify the electrode surface in situ leads to enhanced kinetics. A practical consequence is that one can decrease catalyst loading without sacrificing efficiency.",,,
688,"We are a team, we are a family : Working, Connecting, and Community-Building Through Language in a College Student Dance Organization","College students can experience a lack of social integration into college life (Tinto 1993). Heath and her colleagues (Heath 1998; Heath & McLaughlin 1993a), taking a language socialization perspective (Ochs & Schieffelin 2012), found that younger, inner-city youth aged 5-18 years derived many benefits from participating in community youth-based organizations around sports, dance, dramatic arts, and other activities. As youth engaged in collaborative work with peers and adults leaders within these organizations, they learned and later took up linguistic structures that reflected ""planning ahead"" as well as verbal practices that displayed connection (Heath 1998). The present study uses a language socialization (Ochs & Schieffelin 1984; Heath 1998) perspective, and also a perspective informed by work on peers socializing one another (Goodwin & Kyratzis 2012; Eder 1993) to examine the grammatical and discourse structures used in the everyday peer interactions of members of a student-run dance organization at a large university during their dance practices, and also interviews the youth. During practices, group members used grammatical structures for planning ahead to future outcomes (e.g., if-then constructions), and also used verbal practices for displaying connection (Heath 1998). In the interviews, they reported deriving several benefits from membership in the dance organization, including deriving a sense of family and of being a part of something greater than themselves. Findings are discussed in terms of language socialization theory as well as implications for higher education policies and practice.",,,
689,Social relations and institutional structures in modern American political campaigns,"This research tackles these issues directly by developing a detailed analysis of campaign rally speeches as well as the audience's responses using the tools of Conversation Analysis. Through a descriptive and analytic account of the underlying normative organization of campaign speeches and the contingencies facing both speakers and audience members, this research considers how speakers use these occasions to shape - even transform - the opportunities and bases for public participation in the political process; demonstrating how the distinctive turn-taking system and its relationship to the ""institutional occasion"" (c.f., Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson, 1974; Atkinson and Drew, 1979; Atkinson, 1982; Heritage 1984; Heritage and Greatbatch, 1991; Drew and Heritage, 1992; ) - and the forms of political expression they enable - are consequential for the social relations built through them. The campaign speeches during the US Presidential Election Campaign of 2008 have attracted the attention of a wide range of scholars in Sociology, Political Science, and Communication studies. Although Atkinson (1984), Heritage and Greatbatch (1986), Clayman (1993), and others have radically transformed our understanding of the devices speechmakers use to coordinate audience response (""clap trap""), to date no social or political scientist has described how these moments are stitched together, in real time, to organize the speeches - presidential or otherwise; and we know little about the differences between alternative forms of collective appreciation (e.g., applause versus chanting), and what this might tell us about the different social relations that speakers can establish with audience members by varying specific components of their speech. As a consequence, we understand very little about how politicians compose specific political messages, or how these are shaped by the changing [media] landscape of modern political campaigns. Specifically, an account of the orderliness, structure, and sequential patterns of talk-in-interaction reveals the ways candidates exploit the interactive organization of speech giving in different ways: how different rhetorical forms were used to make relevant different forms of collective appreciation by audience members (e.g., applause versus chants), which allowed candidates to establish different relations with the public (e.g., did the audience agree with the speaker, or did the speaker agree with the audience?); which building blocks used over the course of a speech (and the entire campaign) could be used to mobilize audience members' participation in events beyond the campaign event, and which caused others' speeches to be more inert? This research offers the most complex (and complete) understanding of modern campaign speeches to date, as well as compelling new findings to help understand why some speeches campaigns are more successful than others. In this respect, this research offers a novel approach to a basic question posed by politicians and social/political scientists: What sort of social relations do political leaders establish with the constituents they serve? And how are modern campaign events used to establish such relations? The art of rhetoric (Aristotle) is the art of persuasion: using forms of talk to gather people together - to forge agreement and thereby stimulate [positive] action. How one gets others to agree (with them) - and act on that agreement - is of prominent concern for politicians and those aiming to influence social policy, and is inevitably done through interaction.",,,
690,Mechanisms of rare events in condensed phases,"Chemical reactions, mass transport in solids, protein folding, and nucleation in first-order phase transitions are examples of processes characterized by multiple, long-lived states. Transitions from one (meta)stable state to another are rare and brief, making them difficult to resolve experimentally. And yet the short transition paths contain valuable structural and dynamic information that governs the lifetimes of the stable states. Transition state theory provides a valuable framework for analyzing rare events, provided that an exact dividing surface with no-recrossing can be found. Direct simulation of rare events processes are complicated by the long waiting times for a transition to spontaneously occur. Simulation methods that introduce a bias decrease the waiting time but also risk altering the mechanism. The reactive flux correlation function provides a two-step recipe for computing rates from simulation using an approximate dividing surface, but may miss important details about the physical reaction mechanism. Transition path sampling (TPS) was developed specifically to sample unbiased dynamical reactive trajectories and in combination with likelihood maximization provides an optimized reaction coordinate model. We present new, simple TPS methods that reduce the computational expense of simulating rare events over existing methods. We apply these methods to study rare events in condensed phases and analyze the resulting data with likelihood maximization. The mechanism for vacancy migration in a single domain crystal by activated hops is examined. We find that accurately locating the donor and acceptor sites has a dramatic effect on identifying the mechanism. We next investigate the role of water in ion-pair dissociation, uncovering two solvent mechanisms that influence ion-pair transition states. The resulting dividing surface does not eliminate recrossing, so we present a test for the existence of a no-recrossing surface. It is revealed that an exact dividing surface does not exist for ion-pair dissociation. We discuss the ramifications for transition state theory, Grote-Hynes theory and the relationship between them.",,,
691,"Assembly, function, and sensitivity of the skin microbiome of the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog (Rana sierrae) in the face of invasion by the fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis","Correlations between microbiome composition and Bd infection severity among wild frogs may be the result of either microbiome-mediated resistance to disease, in which bacterial assemblages control the degree of Bd infection, or, alternatively could result from Bd-induced disturbance causing changes in the microbiome. Using a laboratory experiment, I demonstrated that Bd infection alters the R. sierrae microbiome, while I found no direct evidence that the microbiome limits the severity of Bd infection, at least within the range of microbiome variability represented in this study. In addition, some of the bacterial taxa that were sensitive to Bd infection might have been predicted to inhibit the growth of Bd based on results in other study systems. These results highlight the importance of considering microbiome stability when assessing the potential for the microbiome to limit pathogen growth. Symbiotic microbial communities (microbiomes) are ubiquitous inhabitants of multicellular organisms and are increasingly recognized to play roles in host health and development. The skin-associated microbiome of amphibians may affect resistance to the potentially lethal disease, chytridiomycosis, which is caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). The Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog (Rana sierrae ) is threatened with extinction, and Bd is a major driver of declines in these frogs. However, some R. sierrae populations are able to co-exist with the pathogen, persisting despite Bd infection. Understanding why some R. sierrae populations persist with Bd may provide clues for how to minimize the impact of Bd. However, while preliminary studies highlight the possibility that symbiotic bacteria affect disease resistance, very little is known about natural diversity, stability, or function of the amphibian skin microbiome. By integrating controlled experiments with field surveys at multiple spatial scales, these studies reveal new insights into amphibian skin microbiome assembly, function, and sensitivity in the face of infection by an important fungal pathogen, and show the importance of these characteristics of the microbiome in wild amphibian populations. I tested the hypothesis that differences in skin-associated bacterial communities (referred to simply as the microbiome for brevity) can account for differences in the outcome of R. sierrae infection, i.e. population extinction versus persistence. I surveyed microbiomes from multiple R. sierrae populations and showed that populations that persisted or declined to extinction due to Bd indeed harbored different skin bacterial communities, consistent with a protective effect of bacteria in persistent populations. At the same time I found evidence that Bd infection itself may drive variation in the microbiome, both at the local scale (among frogs within a given population), and landscape scale (among populations). Understanding why microbial communities vary among individuals or populations is an important step toward understanding the diversity and function of the microbiome. I present an experiment that tested the effects of natural variation in the aquatic environment and genetic variation among R. sierrae individuals in shaping the skin microbiome.",,,
692,Computational Tools for Large-Scale Linear Systems,"The second main class of high-dimensional problems requiring computational tools are coupled linear reaction-diffusion equations. For this class of models, we focus primarily on the computation of certain high-dimensional matrices which describe in a quantitative sense the input-to-state and state-to-output relationships. We describe algorithms for extracting useful information stored in these matrices and use this information to efficiently compute both reduced order models and open-loop control laws for steering the full system. A key feature of this approach is that the method is completely simulation or experiment free, in fact, in our numerical experiments, the computation of a reduced model or open-loop control law is an order of magnitude faster on a laptop than simulation of the full system on a 32 core node of a high-performance cluster. While the theoretical analysis of linear dynamical systems with finite state-spaces is a mature topic, in situations where the underlying model has a large number of dimensions, modelers must turn to computational tools to better visualize and analyze the dynamic behavior of interest. In these situations, we are confronted with the Curse of Dimensionality: computational and storage complexity grows exponentially in the number of dimensions. In both projects, the enabling computational technology is the recently proposed Tensor Train (TT) structured low-parametric representation of high-dimensional data. The TT-format effectively exploits low-rank structure of the ""unfolding matrices"" for compression and computational efficiency. Formally, the computational complexity of basic TT arithmetics scale linearly in the number of dimensions, potentially circumventing the curse of dimensionality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we performed numerous numerical experiments whose results are reported here. This doctoral project focuses on two main classes of large-scale linear systems which arise in system biology. The Chemical Master Equation (CME) is a Fokker-Planck equation which describes the evolution of the probability mass function of a countable state space Markov process. Each state of the CME is labelled with an ordered S-tuple corresponding to one configuration of a well-mixed chemical system, where S is the number of distinct chemical species of interest. Even in cases where one only considers a projection of the CME to a finite subset of the states, one still must contend with the Curse of Dimensionality: the computational complexity grows exponentially in the number of chemical species. This dissertation describes a computational methodology for efficient solution of the CME which, in the best cases, will scale linearly in the number of chemical species.",,,
693,"On pseudo-Anosov maps, symplectic, Perron-Frobenius matrices, and compression bodies","In 1988, William Thurston announced the completion of a classification of surface automorphisms into three types up to isotopy: periodic, reducible, and pseudo-Anosov. The most common but also least understood maps in this classification are pseudo-Anosovs. We extend our understanding of pseudo-Anosov maps in two ways. First, we show that every Perron unit of appropriate degree has a power which appears as the spectral radius of a symplectic, Perron-Frobenius matrix. This is significant due to possible applications to understanding the spectrum of dilatations for a surface. Second, we present an alternative proof to an important result of Biringer, Johnson, and Minsky showing roughly that a power of a pseudo-Anosov extends over a compression body if and only if the stable lamination bounds. Our alternative proof follows ideas of Casson and Long first presented in 1985.",,,
695,Self-Consistent Field Theory for the Design of Thermoplastic Elastomers from Miktoarm Block Copolymer - Homopolymer Blends,"We have used self-consistent field theory to study the morphological characteristics of blends of miktoarm block copolymers and homopolymers. More specifically, we have studied the effects of segregation strength, miktoarm block copolymer composition, and homopolymer size and volume fraction on the phase diagrams of these systems. A15 domains with discrete A-monomer spherical domains were found to be stable with A-monomer loading fractions of at least as high as 52%. Hexagonally-packed cylindrical domains were found to be stable at A-monomer loadings of at least as high as 72%. These findings represent a significant improvement from the loading fractions of 43% and 60% reported by Lynd et al. for spherical and cylindrical domains in neat miktoarm block copolymers, respectively. It is also quite possible that even greater loading fractions are achievable in systems too large for our simulations. These results predict exciting new materials for next-generation thermoplastic elastomers, since the ideal TPE has a large loading of A monomers in discrete, crystalline or glassy domains, surrounded by a continuous matrix of elastomeric B domains. Additionally, we have performed SCFT simulations modelled after experimental blends of polystyrene and polyisoprene-based miktoarm block copolymers and homopolymers. Certain experimental samples showed fascinating new ""bricks and mortar"" phases and swollen asymmetric lamellar phases. In both cases, the A domains are highly swollen with homopolymer, forcing the miktoarm block copolymer to segregate near the interface and adopt the role of a surfactant. The resulting structures maintain separate A and B domains, but lack long-range order. While it is not possible to study these mesophases using SCFT, since they lack long-range order and therefore well-defined symmetry, our SCFT results show the onset of macrophase separation at similar homopolymer loadings, for both the bricks and mortar phases and the highly swollen lamellae. This supports the theory that both phases are fluctuation-induced mesophases, similar to microemulsions in character, that lie in between the typical ordered structures and full macrophase separation.",,,
696,Characterization of changes in glia-related protein expression following a history of excessive cocaine taking,"The series of experiments detailed in this dissertation utilize this model to address three specific aims: (1) characterize changes in glial-specific proteins and mRNA expression in cortical and limbic brain regions of rats with a history of extended access cocaine self-administration, (2) characterize the behavioral consequences of decreased myelin basic protein on a variety of prefrontal cortex-dependent tasks that are impaired following a history of cocaine use, and (3) to determine the functional significance of decreased myelin basic protein expression on behavioral measures in an animal model of cocaine addiction, including the acquisition and maintenance of intravenous cocaine, dose sensitivity, as well as the extinction and reinstatement of drug-seeking. The majority of addiction research examining the brain has centered on neuronal adaptations both resulting from cocaine use and contributing to the development of addiction. However, neurons constitute a small minority of the total cells within the central nervous system (CNS) and the role of glial cell types, which make up the vast majority of CNS cells, in cocaine addiction is largely unexplored. Imaging studies have revealed white matter deficits within the corpus callosum and post-mortem tissue analysis has revealed decreased oligodendrocyte-specific protein expression within the brains of chronic cocaine users. The extended access (6h/day) cocaine self-administration paradigm conducted in rodents is used to model the escalation of cocaine intake seen within human cocaine users and is critical for gaining insight to the molecular adaptations that result from excessive cocaine use. Taken together, the experiments detailed herein provide further support for an enduring effect of cocaine on the expression of glial-specific proteins within the forebrain and highlight a role for myelin basic protein within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in regulating impulsive choice, but not other cocaine addiction- related behaviors.",,,
697,"You Must Be Smart: Intersecting Gender, Ethnicity, and Degree Type in the Lives of University Mathematics Majors","Many students struggle with the transition into and through university mathematics because they are entering a world that more closely aligns to the language and practices of mathematicians rather than K-12 mathematics. As yet, few studies have focused on how some groups of students experience, succeed, and persist in university mathematics. And fewer still have provided continued examination of the ways that gender and ethnic identities position students' perceptions of mathematics as field and of the ways mathematics is taught. This study focused on how university mathematics majors viewed and perceived the ways that gender and ethnicity impacted their own and others' experiences in mathematics. Data were collected through 35 interviews and three focus groups with a subsample of participants at a public university in Southern California. Data were thematically analyzed in multiple rounds with an intersectional lens, which resulted in three sets of findings: how mathematics majors perceived gender to have impacted university mathematics and their experiences, how mathematics majors perceived ethnicity to have impacted university mathematics and their experiences, and the ways the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degrees were feminized and devalued by students, professors, and the department. These findings suggest that bias around gender and ethnicity in postsecondary mathematics continues, and pervasive stereotypes about ""good"" mathematics students as predominantly European American and male exist. I close with recommendations for sustainable and positive changes that could be incorporated into policy, curricula, and campus support to improve participation rates of both women and Latino/a students.",,,
698,Molecular Ordering in Functional Blends of Organic Semiconductors,"Organic semiconductors offer a convenient reason to study how blending materials affects molecular packing. For example, organic solar cells rely on phase separation between dissimilar compounds to produce the ""bulk heterojunction"" morphology requisite for efficient devices. X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy reveal that functionalized pentacene acceptors, which are highly ordered in neat films, lose long-range correlation when blended with a donor. These same acceptors can form substitutionally disordered single crystals (molecular alloys) when blended with other functionalized pentacenes, which share a high degree of structural similarity. Single crystal diffraction, UV/vis spectroscopy and thin film x-ray scattering show that substitutional disorder does not lead to loss of long-range order, even with the presence of multiple polymorphs. Finally we show that blends of organic materials can also lead to stable molecular glasses. We show that these stable molecular glasses can be formed from solution casting rather than from the more commonly used vapor deposition.",,,
699,Common Core Argument Writing Practices in an Upper Elementary Classroom,"From the social practices of literacies perspective, it is imperative to study literacies by examining the writing practices students engage in and jointly construct as meaningful in their social contexts. To enable a context-specific, process-oriented study of literacy practices in classroom contexts, I utilized the sociocultural perspective of second generation Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) to frame learning as a social process occurring in specific historical and cultural contexts. I observed the classroom practices for over seven months and captured 80 hours of video- and audio-recordings; wrote detailed fieldnotes; conducted interviews with teachers, students and the principal; and collected classrooms texts, including student writing. I analyzed the participant interactions and student writing using ethnographic and discourse analyses, while considering a variety of cultural, historical and contextual factors over time to understand argument writing practices that occurred during the argument writing unit. I argue for the examination of broader contexts and a move away from static conceptualizations of students' linguistic and heritage culture to recognize what historically marginalized and minoritized students are able to do in classrooms. Moreover, I argue that an examination of broader contexts is necessary in order to accurately identify and address external challenges to support students' academic success. Recommendations for practice, policy and research are provided in the discussion. Through these analyses, I found that the definitions and expectations implemented by the teacher matched the CCSS curricular goals, but the ambiguous and unclear presentation of the terminology and expectations made it difficult for students to understand clearly what these goals were and/or how to meet them. Moreover, despite the limited opportunities for dialogic conversations related to argument writing, conversations that featured moments of dialogic discussions offered potential and actualized pedagogical possibilities related to students' argument writing practices. From analyses of thirteen students' argument essays, I found that the majority of the students demonstrated a sophisticated command of many of the teacher's expectations for the argument essay and demonstrated understandings of argument structure. Lastly, I found that some students faced challenges meeting some of the teacher's expectations, however, these challenges were not due to linguistic or cultural barriers, but largely due to external issues. For example, none of the students used facts as data in their arguments. This was because, due to rigid scheduling constraints, the teacher did not provide instruction on how to use facts, opportunities to conduct research or time to practice building arguments. Therefore, in lieu of facts as data, several students relied on their prior knowledge of math and science concepts to support claims in their argument. Despite several external limitations, many students demonstrated a sophisticated command of the teacher's expectations for the argument essay and understandings of argument structure. Argument writing is a complex and challenging endeavor that requires the ability to build logical, effective arguments while following writing conventions of an argument writing genre. While challenging, argument writing is critical for academic success and college entrance. Argument writing is even more imperative with the wide adoption of the K-12 Common Core State Standards (CCSS), which prioritize argument writing across content areas beginning in elementary grades (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices, 2010a). However, the CCSS do not provide the methods or curriculum to achieve the stated goals for argument writing. Moreover, there is a paucity of empirical, context-specific information about the argument writing practices of elementary grade students who have been historically marginalized and minoritized in educational institutions due to their race, ethnicity, language background and socioeconomic status. With this lack of information it is unclear what students are able to do with argument writing and what areas may present challenges for them. Therefore, there is an imperative need to study the argument writing practices in elementary classrooms, a need I addressed in this study.",,,
700,"Queer Cultures at New England Women's Colleges : Sexual Fields, Erotic Capital, and Gender and Sexual Fluidity","Drawing on the tensions between biological determinism and social constructionism from my prior scholarship, this dissertation also shows that exposure to queer-normative erotic worlds fosters a willingness to question norms around sexuality and gender, which promotes a vision of what a utopian queer future could look like. The introduction to an educational environment where same-sex sexuality is not only normalized but embraced by the prevailing student culture creates a community where heterosexuality is not presumed as the default. Such a powerful sense of possibility and freedom rewrites the traditional coming-out narrative premised in failed attempts at heterosexuality and a discovery of one's ""true self"" and begs the question of what wider society would look like if more individuals were asked to challenge their assumptions about their own sexual and gender identities. Using snowball sampling, I interviewed fifty-six LGBTQ students and recent alumnae/i at Mount Holyoke College and Smith College - 32 at Mount Holyoke and 24 at Smith - and asked a range of open-ended questions drawing on the themes of sexual and gender identity, belonging to and disidentification with campus community, characteristics and definitions of queer community, and overall views on gender and sexuality. Performing a qualitative discourse analysis that builds on the theories of a diverse set of gender, sexuality, and critical race scholars, I argue that while the women's colleges studied act as empowering and transformational erotic worlds for sexual and gender exploration, queer hierarchies found in both institutions' student cultures promote gender-, race-, and class-based stratification. These hierarchies elevate white, typically class-privileged masculinity as most desirable while alienating queer students of color and low-income queer students through the maintenance of white-dominated, class-privileged space, sidelining and erasing queer femme students, and rendering transgender-spectrum students simultaneously invisible and hypervisible. This dissertation on the queer cultures found at two New England women's colleges, Mount Holyoke College and Smith College in western Massachusetts, engages in key debates over the value placed on community, identity, and visibility, demonstrating that all three concepts remain powerful and crucial organizing rubrics for many LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) people. At the same time that the queer student cultures at these institutions are regarded by many current students and recent alumnae/i as celebratory havens for sexual and gender diversity, however, they are also implicated in intracommunal stratification and hierarchy, which I critically analyze using Adam Isaiah Green's sexual fields theory and Michel Foucault's theories on biopower and docile bodies. I consider the fundamental tensions that exist in spaces considered simultaneously utopic and oppressive, expanding in the conclusion on what these spaces can tell queer studies scholars about notions of queer futurity and utopia as theorized by Jose Esteban Munoz.",,,
702,Schizophrenia and Substance Use Disorders: Disentangling the Neuropsychological Heterogeneity,"Neurocognitive impairments are a core feature of schizophrenia (SCZ) and have been shown to impact patients' everyday lives, progress in psychosocial treatment, and functional outcome (e.g., Green, Kern, & Heaton, 2000). Although substance use disorders (SUDs) are a common comorbid diagnosis also associated with neurocognitive dysfunction, the literature on the neuropsychology of individuals with SCZ and SUDs is equivocal (Potvin, Stravo, & Pelletier, 2012; Tervo, 2007). The aim of the present study was to explore a possible additive effect of SUDs on neuropsychological impairment in SCZ using a novel research approach that emphasizes individual variability. In addition to SUDs, other clinical attributes and demographic characteristics that could account for the cognitive heterogeneity among individuals with SCZ were explored. Data were obtained from the Mental Illness and Neuroscience Discovery Clinical Imaging Consortium database. Participants included: patients with SCZ and a lifetime history of a SUD (SCZ+; n = 86), patients with SCZ without a SUD history (SCZ-; n = 69), and controls (n = 154). Widely used neuropsychological tasks were grouped into cognitive domains using a composite score approach with the control participants serving as a normative sample. Neuropsychological functioning of the patient sub-groups was compared using a MANOVA as well as Chi-square analyses of the frequency and extent of impairment within and across cognitive domains. Results yielded no significant differences between the patient subgroups. The current findings support the conclusion that regardless of statistical approach, within-group differences in neuropsychological functioning are larger than are between-group differences. Further results suggested that patients' age and cognitive reserve significantly predicted neuropsychological functioning over and above their history of SUDs. Implications of the findings for future research and clinical practice are discussed.",,,
703,Drinking motives as mediators between victimization and risk for hazardous alcohol use among sexual minority women: A path model investigation,"Previous research demonstrates a relationship between sexual minority victimization experiences and hazardous alcohol use among sexual minority (lesbian, bisexual, queer, and same-sex attracted) women (SMW). The underlying mechanisms in this relationship, however, remain unclear (Lehavot & Simoni, 2011a). The purpose of the present study was to test a motivational model of hazardous alcohol use among SMW; the model examined the mediating role of enhancement, social, conformity, and coping drinking motives (Cooper, 1994) in the relationship between sexual minority victimization and risk for hazardous drinking. Snowball and targeted sampling strategies were used to recruit SMW (N = 371) for a cross-sectional, online survey assessing past-year experiences with heterosexist harassment, rejection, and discrimination; lifetime experiences with sexual orientation-based physical and sexual assault; drinking motivations; and indicators of hazardous alcohol use. Path analyses were performed using structural equation modeling; the final model demonstrated acceptable fit and accounted for significant portions of the variance in alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences. Indirect relationships emerged between recent sexual minority harassment, rejection, and discrimination and risk for hazardous drinking outcomes, via the three motives. Results also showed an indirect relationship between past-year victimization and alcohol-related consequences, via coping motives. The results expand understanding of the role of various drinking motives in problematic alcohol use; and point to the importance of recent sexual minority victimization as a risk factor for heavy drinking and vulnerability to adverse consequences from alcohol. Implications for clinical intervention and future research are discussed, as well as limitations of the study.",,,
704,Current Aperture III-Nitride Edge-emitting Blue Laser Diode,"The main features of this design are represented by the deep etching of the laser diode ridge through the active region, the controlled etching of the active region by PECE and the increase of the p-contact area with respect to the active region area. Preliminary experiments manifest that CA-LD has similar threshold current density, slope efficiency and peak output power of the more commonly used shallow etch ridge design and it has also shown a reduction in the series resistance down to _40% with respect to the shallow-etch LDs indicating the potential of the CA-LD design in high-efficient, high-power, high-frequency LD applications. This work presents the first Nitride non polar Current Aperture Edge Emitting Blue Laser Diode (CA-LD) fabricated using the Photo-Electro-Chemical Etching (PECE) technique.",,,
705,Resilience in the Aftermath of a Technological Disaster: A Community-Based Mixed Methods Research Study,"These research findings highlight that resilience can emerge even after immense tragedy. Results provide guidance in developing resilience-based disaster responses to improve post-disaster outcomes. Key recommendations include: normalizing experiences, develop routines, building support, promoting positivity, highlight strengths, foster empowerment, attend to spirituality, and providing frequent and easy access to therapy. The path model examined coping styles (seeking support, positive reappraisal, and problem-solving) as pathways to resilience and the indirect effects of coping and resilience on resource loss and psychological distress. Path results found seeking support and positive reappraisal positively predicted resilience. In addition an indirect path was found from resource loss to psychological distress through seeking support and positive reappraisal and resilience. Qualitative themes and domains that emerged from the open-ended questions and interviews included: Reactions, Methods of Resilience, Impacts, Gains, and Existing Needs. Reactions focused on immediate evacuation responses following the explosion. Methods of Resilience centered on coping behaviors used to overcome the disaster such as, turning to faith, seeking professional assistance, and perseverance. Impacts consisted of negative consequences that resulted because of the disaster, such as anxiety, isolation, and depression. Gains were described as unexpected positive outcomes, such as strengthened relationships. Existing needs highlighted areas that were needed to help foster resilience, which included desires for more opportunities to connect and socialize with their neighbors. A natural gas pipeline exploded in a residential neighborhood in Western United States. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of resilience in the aftermath of this disaster. Traditionally, disaster literature has focused on the negative impacts of disasters, emphasizing distress and psychopathology. Researchers have more recently begun to explore protective factors that reduce psychopathology. However, few studies have directly examined resilience in this context. The study, guided by a Community-Based Participatory Research design, employed a two phase mixed methods design with phase 1 encompassing a quantitative survey completed by 146 participants to test a model of resilience and qualitative open questions to explore disaster impacts and coping. Phase 2 was comprised of nine individual follow-up interviews to better understand the individual experiences of the disaster.",,,
706,The Effect of Culture-Specific Performance-Based Assessment Techniques and Ethnic Matching on African Americans' Perceptions of Therapeutic Alliance and Cultural Competence,"The Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) is a standard but culturally-biased performance-based technique used to assess the personality characteristics of people across different racial and ethnic backgrounds (Thompson, 1949). Research in the field of multicultural psychology has demonstrated the need for culture-specific assessments and ethnic matching to improve treatment effectiveness with clients of color (Hall, 2001; Sue, 1998). The Contemporized Themes Concerning Blacks Test (C-TCB) is a culture-specific performance-based assessment technique designed with Africentric stimulus characters, content, and themes to enhance the cultural validity of personality traits projected by African Americans. The use of culture-specific performance-based assessment techniques is predicted to improve clients' perceptions of their therapist and treatment. The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the effect of traditional and culture-specific performance-based techniques on participants' perceptions of the therapeutic alliance and their clinicians' cultural competence across ethnically matched and mismatched dyads. Forty African American adult participants were assigned to one of four conditions that differed by performance-based assessment technique (TAT or C-TCB) and clinician race (European American or African American). No significant differences were found in participants' (a) ratings of the anticipated therapeutic alliance, (b) ratings of clinicians' cultural competence, or (c) verbal productivity across the four conditions. Results suggests that the use of culture-specific performance-based techniques and ethnic matching may have no effect on therapeutic outcomes for African Americans.",,,
707,Geometric Pursuit Evasion,"In this dissertation we investigate pursuit evasion problems set in geometric environments. These games model a variety of adversarial situations in which a team of agents, called pursuers, attempts to catch a rogue agent, called the evader. In particular, we consider the following problem: how many pursuers, each with the same maximum speed as the evader, are needed to guarantee a successful capture? Our primary focus is to provide combinatorial bounds on the number of pursuers that are necessary and sufficient to guarantee capture. Next we consider a more general problem with a less restrictive sensing model. The pursuers' sensors are visibility based, only providing the location of the evader if it is in direct line of sight. We begin my making only the minimalist assumption that pursuers and the evader have the same maximum speed. When the environment is a simply-connected (hole-free) polygon of n vertices, we show that &THgr;(n1/2 ) pursuers are both necessary and sufficient in the worst-case. When the environment is a polygon with holes, we prove a lower bound of &ohm;( n2/3 ) and an upper bound of O( n5/6 ) pursuers, where n includes the vertices of the hole boundaries. However, we show that with realistic constraints on the polygonal environment these bounds can be drastically improved. Namely, if the players' movement speed is small compared to the features of the environment, we give an algorithm with a worst case upper bound of O(log n) pursuers for simply-connected n-gons and O(_h + log n) for polygons with h holes. The first problem we consider consists of an unpredictable evader that is free to move around a polygonal environment of arbitrary complexity. We assume that the pursuers have complete knowledge of the evader's location at all times, possibly obtained through a network of cameras placed in the environment. We show that regardless of the number of vertices and obstacles in the polygonal environment, three pursuers are always sufficient and sometimes necessary to capture the evader. We then consider several extensions of this problem to more complex environments. In particular, suppose the players move on the surface of a 3-dimensional polyhedral body; how many pursuers are required to capture the evader? We show that 4 pursuers always suffice (upper bound), and that 3 are sometimes necessary (lower bound), for any polyhedral surface with genus zero. Generalizing this bound to surfaces of genus g, we prove the sufficiency of (4g + 4) pursuers. Finally, we show that 4 pursuers also suffice under the ""weighted region"" constraints, where the movement costs through different regions of the (genus zero) surface have (different) multiplicative weights. The final problem we consider takes a small step toward addressing the fact that location sensing is noisy and imprecise in practice. Suppose a tracking agent wants to follow a moving target in the two-dimensional plane. We investigate what is the tracker's best strategy to follow the target and at what rate does the distance between the tracker and target grow under worst-case localization noise. We adopt a simple but realistic model of relative error in sensing noise: the localization error is proportional to the true distance between the tracker and the target. Under this model we are able to give tight upper and lower bounds for the worst-case tracking performance, both with or without obstacles in the Euclidean plane.",,,
708,Distinguishing molecular environments in supported Pt catalysts and their influences on activity and selectivity,"This thesis entails the synthesis, automated catalytic testing, and in situ molecular characterization of supported Pt and Pt-alloy nanoparticle (NP) catalysts, with emphasis on how to assess the molecular distributions of Pt environments that are affecting overall catalytic activity and selectivity. We have taken the approach of (a) manipulating nucleation and growth of NPs using oxide supports, surfactants, and inorganic complexes to create Pt NPs with uniform size, shape, and composition, (b) automating batch and continuous flow catalytic reaction tests, and (c) characterizing the molecular environments of Pt surfaces using in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy and solid-state 195Pt NMR. The following will highlight the synthesis and characterization of Ag-doped Pt NPs and their influence on C 2H2 hydrogenation selectivity, and the implementation of advanced solid-state 195Pt NMR techniques to distinguish how distributions of molecular Pt environments vary with nanoparticle size, support, and surface composition.",,,
709,"Understanding Polymer-Fullerene Morphology in Organic Solar Cells via Photoluminescence, Raman Scattering, and Spectroscopic Imaging","Understanding and controlling carrier transport in conjugated polymer films and composites is critical to the development and application of plastic solar cells. Recent efforts have focused on ""bulk heterojunction"" structures where a conjugated polymer donor is mixed at the nanoscale with a fullerene acceptor to achieve large interfacial areas for exciton splitting. In these systems, fabrication protocols dramatically affect device efficiency and charge transport is intimately tied to film morphology through local order, domain formation, and compositional heterogeneity. We employ both far-field and confocal/near-field optical spectroscopy (absorbance, low-temperature photoluminescence, Raman) to study chain order (aggregation, pi-stacking), photo-oxidation, and local morphology in conjugated polymer (PPV and polythiophene) -- fullerene (PCBM) blends. Through quantitative analysis of exciton bandwidths, emission intensity, and vibronic lineshapes, we demonstrate that competition exists between the chemical ""disordering"" effect of photo-degradation and the physical ""ordering"" effect of aggregation, each of which dominate under different processing conditions. Large changes in photoluminescence and Raman show that PCBM begins to significantly hinder intra-chain planarization and inter-chain pi-overlap at a critical PCBM weight fraction. Furthermore, the critical weight fraction is a function of the polymer regiochemistry, occurring at lower PCBM weight fractions for a more regio-random polymer. Mild thermal annealing of blended films was seen to restore order, which results from PCBM phase segregation (lower dispersion) and growth of polymer aggregates. Spatially resolved spectral analysis of photoluminescence was also used to map fullerene diffusion and agglomeration as well as detect local changes in interfacial contact between donor and acceptor domains due to thermal annealing.",,,
710,"Multiscale Modeling, Analysis and Simulation in Multiphase Systems","One fundamental question arises: how well and to what extent can a bottom-up developed mesoscale model recover the physical properties of a molecular scale system? To answer this question, we explore systematically the properties of a CG model that is developed to represent an intermediate mesoscale model between the atomistic and continuum scales, and thus reduce the computational cost relative to an underlying reference all-atom (AA) Lennard-Jones (LJ) simulation. In Chapter 2, the thermodynamic properties are considered in detail while the transport properties are examined in the third chapter. Finally, a multiscale problem is studied from a thermodynamic point of view using molecular dynamics simulations. We are interested in developing a fundamental understanding of the unusually long lifetime of surface nanobubbles, which is experimentally observed in several studies but does not follow predictions of classical macroscopic theory. We develop a novel free energy calculation technique that can estimate the interfacial properties of a nanobubble of various sizes and contact angles in the presence of a gas-enriched hydrophobic surface. Several characteristics of the system are reported including the hydrophobic wall properties and the density and pressure profiles of the two-phase system. To demonstrate the potentially unique contributions of water, we simulate the two-phase system using both LJ and SPC/E models for comparison. The preliminary results show that a small nanobubble can exist at a metastable state when the contact angle is small around 9 to 20 degrees, which agrees with the experimental results and this is distinctly observed when an explicit water model is used. Also, we conclude that the gas enrichment layer is responsible for the stability of nanobubble. Multiscale methods have been developed over the last decade to overcome a significant challenge for computer simulation and modeling - the broad span of time and length scales in biosystems, materials and flow problems. To describe and simulate properties or phenomena on scales that are not accessible to fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, coarse-graining techniques have recently attracted great interest for providing descriptions at a mesoscopic level of resolution that preserve fluid thermodynamic and transport behaviors with a reduced number of degrees of freedom and hence less computational demand. In this dissertation, we mainly focus on particle-based coarse-grained (CG) models, which are constructed from bottom-up, i.e. from fully atomistic systems, especially for flow problems. To coarse-grain, the iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) is used to determine a CG potential for a (1-phi)N mesoscale particle system, where phi is the degree of coarse-graining, so as to reproduce the radial distribution function (RDF) of an N atomic particle system and then propose a reformulation of IBI as a robust minimization procedure that enables simultaneous matching of the RDF and the fluid pressure. This new method also improves the isothermal compressibility relative to pure IBI. Unlike the RDF and the pressure, dynamical properties such as the self-diffusion coefficient and viscosity in a CG model cannot be matched during coarse-graining by modifying the pair interaction. Instead, removed degrees of freedom require a modification of the equations of motion to simulate their implicit effects on dynamics. A simple but approximate approach is to introduce a friction coefficient, gamma, and random forces for the remaining degrees of freedom, in which case gamma becomes an additional parameter in the coarse-grained model that can be tuned. We consider the non-Galilean-invariant Langevin and the Galilean-invariant dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) thermostats with CG systems in which we can systematically tune the fraction phi of removed degrees of freedom.",,,
711,Relating Film Structure/Microstructure on Device Function/Microproperties in Conjugated Polymers and Polymer/Small Molecule Blends,"Over the last twenty years conjugated organic materials, polymers and small molecules, have attracted broad interest due to their potential applications in the field of solution processed low cost electronics. Due to their semi/polycrystalline nature the spatial arrangement of crystallites and disordered regions in the film have a significant influence over charge transport properties. Structure-Function relationships are universal; consequently, the focus of my research thesis is to relate the film structure/microstructure to device performance and micro-properties, specifically in thin film transistors and bulk conductivity measurements. My initial research focus was on how modification of a semiconducting polymers backbone alters the packing structure and in turn impacts device performance. We then focused on how modification of TFT interface microstructures by altering between dielectric surfaces changes the orientaional correlation length in the semiconductors crystalline domains which in turn directly impacts the field effect mobility. The final two projects focused on doping conjugated polymers with small molecular acceptors. The purpose was to understand how bulk packing dominates conductivity in order to better understand what appears to be a universal transport behavior in these blends. These insights into the structural changes provide a platform under which to analyze the electrical measurements where significant changes in conductivity were observed at high acceptor concentrations but results showed dependence upon pre and post processing conditions. As expected, increases in film conductivity scaled with acceptor concentration but of special interest is how the conductivity showed temperature stability upon annealing, even increasing under certain conditions, near the polymer liquid crystal transition temperature and then decreasing below the as cast baseline at higher annealing temperatures. The electrical study combined with the structural analysis provided insight on the location of the small molecule dopants and how they directly impact film properties.",,,
712,Deformation of Polymer Composites in Force Protection Systems,"A separate analytical framework for describing the accelerations caused by head impact during, for example, the secondary collision of a vehicle occupant with the cabin interior during an external event is also presented. The severity of impact, characterized by the Head Injury Criterion (HIC), is used to assess the efficacy of crushable foams in mitigating head injury. The framework is used to identify the optimal foam strength that minimizes the HIC for prescribed mass and velocity, subject to constraints on foam thickness. The predictive capability of the model is evaluated through comparisons with a series of experimental measurements from impacts of an instrumented headform onto several commercial foams. Additional comparisons are made with the results of finite element simulations. An analytical model for the planar impact of a cylindrical mass on a foam is also developed. This model sets a theoretical bound for the reduction in HIC by utilizing a ""plate-on-foam"" design. Experimental results of impact tests on foams coupled with stiff composite plates are presented, with comparisons to the theoretical limits predicted by the analytical model. Design maps are developed from the analytical models, illustrating the variations in the HIC with foam strength and impact velocity. Systems used for protecting personnel, vehicles and infrastructure from ballistic and blast threats derive their performance from a combination of the intrinsic properties of the constituent materials and the way in which the materials are arranged and attached to one another. The present work addresses outstanding issues in both the intrinsic properties of high-performance fiber composites and the consequences of how such composites are integrated into force protection systems. One aim is to develop a constitutive model for the large-strain intralaminar shear deformation of an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fiber-reinforced composite. To this end, an analytical model based on a binary representation of the constituent phases is developed and validated using finite element analyses. The model is assessed through comparisons with experimental measurements on cross-ply composite specimens in the +/-45 orientation. The hardening behavior and the limiting tensile strain are attributable to rotations of fibers in the plastic domain and the effects of these rotations on the internal stress state. The model is further assessed through quasi-static punch experiments and dynamic impact tests using metal foam projectiles. The finite element model based on this model accurately captures both the back-face deflection-time history and the final plate profile (especially the changes caused by fiber pull-in).",,,
713,The Movement Democrat Grassroots Activism and Organizational Change in the California Democratic Party,"Individual activists transition relatively freely between ""movement activism"" and ""party activism"" in order to achieve their larger goals. Political parties are also shaped by the activity of social movement groups and organizations within their structures. Recent changes in the style and organization of political campaigns have produced further convergences between movement and party organizations. This has been the case in California, where several waves of movement and grassroots activists have successfully pushed for greater participatory opportunities within the Party and stronger commitments to core values. Surprisingly, the data suggest that movement activity in the CDP may have helped to strengthen the Party's ability to better fulfil its traditional political functions, despite the well-documented hostility to party prerogatives that characterize California's political culture and electoral system. Sociologists have often defined social movement activity against other, more institutional forms of political engagement, including activism in political parties. This dissertation attempts to develop a more flexible, organic and systemic understanding of the relationship between movements and parties by examining the impact of social movements on the California Democratic Party (CDP). The research is based in participant observation of the Party's activity at all levels, data from a 2011 survey of 524 CDP convention delegates (out of a total of 2556), as well as interviews with current and past CDP leaders, activists and staff. The findings are contextualized in a broad, historical narrative of structural and cultural change surrounding the Democratic Party nationally. Despite the theoretical division between movements and parties, this study finds significant overlap between these two forms of political activity. In a context in which party organizations' role in politics is heavily circumscribed, CDP leaders and activists have created an organization that is both effective electorally as well as comparatively independent and participatory. That social movements and movement activists have played a role in the narrative of conflict and cooperation that produced this outcome is significant---both for scholars interested in the impact of movements on institutional politics, as well as students of political parties interested in preserving or expanding the crucial role they play in modern democracies.",,,
714,"The Global Environmental Moment: Sovereignty and American Science on Spaceship Earth, 1945-1974","Collectively, the collapse of the global environmental moment amid these political and ideological differences created the historical ruts in which debate on global environmental issues have continued to tread ever since. Ultimately, the UNCHE produced a Declaration, an Action Plan, and a new United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to coordinate environmental planning within the UN; yet these outward successes institutionalized non-binding, disjointed, and underfunded efforts that split the global North and South over the means for attaining global environmental protection. With the UN conference refusing to alter the status quo of geopolitical organization and impotent against stemming the environmental impact of economic development, large numbers of non-governmental organizations, politically active scientists, and environmental advocates of all stripes also descended on Stockholm to voice their own opinions on the causes and solutions to ongoing environmental degradation. Yet, the alternative conferences in Stockholm where these outliers met also fractured in political conflicts between advocates for the global South and those promoting environmental remedies popular in the global North. This dissertation argues that the still-existent political contours of international engagement on global environmental issues were forged in the late 1960s and early 1970s, in what I call the global environmental moment, during planning for and in the actions taken surrounding the first intergovernmental conference on the world environment: the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (UNCHE), held in Stockholm Sweden in June 1972. Throughout the prior years of planning for the UNCHE, relatively less developed nations of the global South, led by Brazil, demanded that all environmental efforts must support---not limit---endeavors toward economic development, and along with other members of the Unite Nations, refused to relinquish their national sovereignty for the sake of global environmental protection.",,,
715,Historia e circulacao do manuscrito BnF fonds portugais 9 da Cronica Geral de Espanha de 1344,"Manuscript fonds portugais 9 of the Bibliotheque nationale de France contains a ca. 1460 version of the Old Portuguese Cronica Geral de Espanha de 1344, which tells the history of the Iberian Peninsula from its biblical beginnings until the 15th century. It is considered a textual milestone in Iberian historiography through its Old Portuguese and Old Castilian versions, and even through its reception in Catalan historiography from the Renaissance. This dissertation focuses on the history and circulation of the Cronica Geral de Espanha de 1344 based on archival research. This manuscript was most probably commissioned in Portugal around 1460 for Pedro, Constable of Portugal. In fact, the text of the Cronica offers an expansion probably used as a political maneuver that praises Pedro's royal dynasty and its place in the history of the Iberian realms. The manuscript itself is a relevant example of medieval transnationalism applied to manuscript circulation as cultural and social artifact, and its circulation throughout the centuries is the result of the historical and diplomatic connections between Portugal, Catalonia, and France. My long term research goal is to review the theories concerning the origins and whereabouts of the manuscript in the light of new materials.",,,
716,Efficient Methods for the Synthesis of Functional Organic Materials,"So called 'click' chemistries including the quintessential copper-catalyzed cycloaddition between azides and alkynes (CuAAC) and coupling between thiol and alkene partners (thiol-ene) represent two of the most successful chemical transformations in modern polymer chemistry. New methods that take advantage of these tools have been developed that provide efficient routes to remarkably diverse materials including dendrimers and functional polymer nanoparticles. Specifically, high molecular weight dendrimers up to the sixth generation were prepared using an orthogonal strategy that combines both CuAAC and thiol--ene chemistry and permits complete growth and purification of each generation in rapid succession. Similarly, well-defined block copolymers containing an alkyne-functional, biodegradable block were synthesized and conjugated with various azide-containing molecules. From these multifunctional block copolymers, a new class of delivery vehicles based on self-assembled polymer nanoparticles could be accessed with release of the covalently attached payload being triggered by degradation of the polymer scaffold. Conjugated polymers and small molecules represent another class of important materials with myriad applications that range from organic electronics (OPVs, OLEDs, etc.) to biosensors. Advancements in molecular building blocks and innovative design strategies for preparing functional materials like conjugated block copolymers are described. The preparation of end-functional donor-acceptor conjugated polymers is also demonstrated, exemplified using unsymmetrical perylene diimide derivatives for which an efficient synthetic methodology was concurrently developed. In addition, two libraries of stimuli-responsive conjugated polymers based on azulene were investigated and illustrate a new design principle in which optoelectronic properties can be systematically modulated simply by controlling the regiochemistry of the constituent building blocks. The development of efficient methods for preparing well-defined, functional materials has broad-reaching implications across a number of scientific disciplines and is a critical step toward enabling technological innovation. A variety of useful strategies have been established that facilitate access to a diverse range of polymers and small molecules. These synthetic contributions as well as the properties and applications of the materials are presented.",,,
717,Binge Alcohol Drinking Elicits a Persistent Negative Affective State in Mice,"In alcohol-dependent humans, cessation of alcohol consumption produces a dysphoric, anxiogenic state that can persist into protracted withdrawal. This aversive withdrawal-induced affective state is theorized to contribute to the negative reinforcing properties of alcohol that maintains and/or precipitates relapse in those suffering with alcoholism. Despite this and evidence that alcohol withdrawal increases biochemical indices of stress, there are relatively few published studies examining the impact of cessation from binge drinking on behavioral measures of negative affect. To this end, 60 C57BL/6 mice were allowed to consume alcohol under modified Drinking-in-the-Dark (DID) procedures, which consisted of access to a sipper tube containing either 20% alcohol or water for 2hrs/day, 5 days/week, for 6 consecutive weeks. Half of the mice from each drinking group were subjected to a 2-day behavioral test battery consisting of conventional assays of anxiety and depression either 24hrs (n=30) or 21 days (n=30) into withdrawal. A combined analysis revealed higher indices of anxiety assessed in the light/dark shuttle box, novel object encounter, elevated plus maze, and marble burying tests in alcohol-drinking (AD) compared to water-drinking (WD) controls, independent of withdrawal duration. AD mice also showed a shorter latency to float on the first day of the forced swim test, indicating a higher prevalence of behavioral despair; however, these mice also showed an increase in swimming behavior on a re-exposure session, suggesting impaired emotional memory. The present results indicate that increases in anxiety and depression emerge very early after cessation of drinking and persist into protracted withdrawal, suggesting that a history of heavy binge drinking produces enduring neuroadaptations within brain circuits mediating emotional arousal.",,,
718,The reflective mind: Examining the brain connectivity underlying accurate metacognitive awareness,"Together these results suggest that the ability to accurately reflect on mnemonic and perceptual information is related to the integrity of unique brain connections. Lastly, Study 3 examined the plasticity of metacognitive ability by evaluating the impact of a two-week meditation-training program on metacognitive accuracy. Compared to an active control group that elicited no change, we found that meditation training significantly enhanced introspective accuracy in the mnemonic but not perceptual domain. These data provide preliminary evidence that, in at least some domains, the human capacity to introspect is plastic, and can be improved through training. Despite the seeming immediacy with which we reflect on our minds, research over the past forty years has revealed that our introspective access to our mind is noisy and subject to inaccuracies and dissociations. The research in this thesis exploits individual differences in the capacity to accurately reflect on different cognitive processes in order to explore the brain mechanisms underlying accurate introspection. A major unanswered question is whether introspective accuracy is a domain-general process supported by a homogenous neuroanatomical substrate or whether it varies across different cognitive domains. Using tools from signal detection theory, the current studies quantified individual differences in metacognitive accuracy in the domains of memory and perception in order to i) understand whether they reflect homogeneous or dissociable introspective capacities and ii) evaluate the brain mechanisms mediating the ability to accurately reflect on different cognitive processes. Building on recent work linking metacognitive ability to the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC), Study 1 examined how the functional connectivity between aPFC and other cortical regions is linked to metacognitive ability across perception and memory domains. Study 2 then extended this analysis to evaluate how individual differences in metacognitive ability relate to the integrity of white matter anatomical connections. Across these studies, metacognitive accuracy in perception and memory domains were found to be uncorrelated across individuals, suggesting that metacognitive skill in one domain may not necessarily transfer to another. Furthermore, individual differences in metacognitive ability in each domain were related to distinct patterns of functional connectivity and the integrity of distinct white matter microstructure.",,,
719,Helping to Inspire: Culture and the Evaluations and Motivational Outcomes of Solicited and Unsolicited Assistance,"Later, participants worked on a second related task, as a way of measuring the impact of solicited and unsolicited assistance situations on post-assistance motivation and later task performance. Study 2 found that post-assistance task performance, in terms of creativity and complexity, was best following solicited assistance situations compared to unsolicited or no assistance situations, with no cultural differences by assistance type and no differences on self-reported motivation. Implications for future research are discussed. Tapping into how cultural norms may influence evaluations of assistance and assistance use, in Study 1, participants read about an interaction between a teaching assistant and a student during which the student receives solicited or unsolicited assistance and then answered questions about their evaluations of the assistance recipient and provider in the interaction, as well as answering questions on their own academic assistance use, in order to examine how solicited and unsolicited assistance are evaluated in different cultures and how these types of assistance are utilized. Study 1 found that Asian Americans had more positive evaluations of unsolicited assistance compared to solicited assistance, whereas European Americans showed the opposite evaluation pattern. In Study 2, participants worked on a set of tasks, where the first task either involved the opportunity to solicit assistance or participants received unsolicited assistance. Research on academic achievement has focused on a variety of different moderators of academic motivation, and the role of culture is a relatively new topic of study in this area. Combining previous research on culture, education, and motivation, and following previous studies on culture and social support, the current research addresses how interactions between providers and recipients of assistance may enhance or detract from motivation in academic and learning domains, and how these outcomes may be influenced by cultural values and cultural norms. In two studies, this research directly examined evaluations of unsolicited and solicited assistance and individual assistance use, as well as the motivational implications of cultural differences in responses to solicited and unsolicited assistance situations in an educational setting.",,,
720,Economic Shocks and Household Decisions,"This dissertation concerns various types of economic shocks and the implications of such shocks on the decisions of households. There has been a long history in the theoretical economics literature of modeling agents as forward-looking and thus in making their life-cycle decisions they will have accounted for the paths they expect their income, wealth, or economic opportunities to take. Therefore, these chapters will focus on households' responses to unexpected changes in economic factors. The two types of economic shocks to be explored are income shocks, a shock that will affect only one spouse, and house price shocks, a shock that affects both spouses. Particular care is given to trying to identify exogenous and unexpected changes in income or wealth for the households. The asymmetric responses to financial gains versus losses are explored for each type of shock. Throughout the analyses are conducted using longitudinal data on individuals or households. These data allow for observations of the sample household through a long portion of its life cycle and through changes in their economic situation. In the first chapter, I explore the effects of unpredicted changes in permanent income of each spouse on the probability of divorce for the couple. I find that if the husband experiences a negative income shock, the probability of divorce increases. If the wife experiences a negative income shock, this effect on divorce is only true if she had a switch into unemployment. In Chapter 2, I continue the analysis of economic shocks on probability of divorce by looking at responses to local house price shocks. These local housing prices give us changes in wealth for the households that are exogenous to many of the other decisions an individual household makes. In response to a positive house price shock, the risk of divorce decreases for couples. Finally in the third chapter, I analyze the effect of housing prices on another household behavior: labor supply choices. Married female homeowners are less likely to be employed following a positive house price shock in their metropolitan area. Conversely, older married male homeowners are more likely to be employed when there are negative house price shocks in their area.",,,
721,Efficient Parallel Optimizations for All Pairs Similarity Search,"The first part of this thesis targets APSS with the cosine similarity metric. We present a two-stage APSS using a fast partitioning, load assignment algorithm. Given a large number of documents, our static partitioning places dissimilar documents into different groups to eliminate unnecessary comparison between their content. Next, due to the symmetry nature of the comparison, we use a circular load assignment to remove the redundant comparisons and reduce the I/O and communication overhead. Our evaluation shows that the proposed two-stage APSS is one order of magnitude faster than the previous work and reduces up to 70% of the total comparisons. To speed up intensive APSS computation in modern CPUs with memory hierarchy, we also describe cache-conscious algorithms using indexing with efficient data traversal and layout using index splitting and coalescing for better temporal locality. Our analysis shows the improved code is 2.74x as fast as the baseline. In the second part of the thesis we discuss an offline duplicate removal system and techniques to speed up the near-duplicate detection of text documents. The system employs a multidimensional mapping to partition the dataset and balance the load across multiple machines. This is further extended to incremental duplicate clustering for applications with continuous data update. All Pairs Similarity Search (APSS), a computationally intensive process, is used in many search and mining applications such as data clustering, near-duplicate detection, anti-spamming, and collaborative filtering for recommendation. APSS is time consuming because its time complexity is quadratic to the dataset size, and thus it does not scale well for big data. The research in this thesis aims at speeding up APSS using exact, efficient and parallel techniques including data partitioning, load balancing and communication optimizations.",,,
722,Using multiple genes in a gene-culture interaction on expressive tendencies,"Building on gene--environment interaction (G x E) research, this study investigates how a genetic susceptibility index interacts with culture to influence expressive tendencies in a gene--culture interaction. Previous studies have identified specific genetic variants associated with greater susceptibility to environmental influences. Taking culture as a form of environment, individuals with more susceptible variants are expected to exhibit behavior more in line with cultural norms. We assessed susceptibility using a genetic susceptibility index, which was composed of multiple polymorphisms previously identified in gene---culture interaction studies of susceptibility genotypes. American and Korean participants completed assessments of expressive behavior, including value of expression, emotional suppression, and cognitive reappraisal tendencies, and were genotyped for OXTR, 5HTR1A, SERT, and DRD4. Increased expressive values and behaviors are normative in an American cultural context, but not in an East Asian cultural context like Korea. Comparing between Americans and Koreans, we found the predicted interaction on expression: Individuals with higher genetic susceptibility to environmental influence were more likely to exhibit expressive tendencies in accordance with cultural norms. Specifically, among Americans, increased genetic susceptibility was associated with greater value of expression and lower emotional suppression, while Koreans showed the opposite pattern. For cognitive reappraisal, which does not differ between the cultures, we found no interactive effect between genetic susceptibility and culture. Both cultural groups showed an association between increased genetic susceptibility and use of cognitive reappraisal. These findings suggest cultural factors moderate the influence of genetic susceptibility across multiple genes on the manifestation of expressive tendencies.",,,
723,"Tuning The Optical, Charge Injection, and Charge Transport Properties of Organic Electronic Devices","Since the early 1900's, synthetic insulating polymers (plastics) have slowly taken over the role that traditional materials like wood or metal have had as basic components for construction, manufactured goods, and parts. Plastics allow for high throughput, low temperature processing, and control of bulk properties through molecular modifications. In the same way, pi-conjugated organic molecules are emerging as a possible substitute for inorganic materials due to their electronic properties. The semiconductive nature of pi-conjugated materials make them an attractive candidate to replace inorganic materials, primarily due to their promise for low cost and large-scale production of basic semiconducting devices such as light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and field-effect transistors. Before organic semiconductors can be realized as a commercial product, several hurdles must be cleared. The purpose of this dissertation is to address three distinct properties that dominate the functionality of devices harnessing these materials: (1) optical properties, (2) charge injection, and (3) charge transport. First, it is shown that the electron injection barrier in the emissive layer of polymer light-emitting diodes can be significantly reduced by processing of novel conjugated oligoelectrolytes or deoxyribonucleic acid atop the emissive layer. Next, the charge transport properties of several polymers could be modified by processing them from solvents containing small amounts of additives or by using regioregular and enantiopure chemical structures. The sum of these works help to create new pathways for the synthesis and design of new pi-conjugated materials and device architectures. All of this is in hopes of achieving higher performance and more stable devices to rival inorganic systems. It is then demonstrated that the optical and electronic properties of Lewis basic polymer structures can be readily modified by interactions with strongly electron-withdrawing Lewis acids. Through red-shifted absorption, photoluminescence, and electroluminescence, a single pi-conjugated backbone can be polychromatic. In addition, interaction with Lewis acids can remarkably p-dope the hole transport of the parent polymer, leading to a two-orders of magnitude increase in the hole mobility. Finally, the hole, electron, and double carrier transport in solar cell devices are studied in a bid to examine the correlations between bulk morphologies and free carrier recombination.",,,
724,Platinum group metal oxides for heterogeneous catalysis: Novel synthesis and advanced characterization,"Through this study of Pd ions, we have developed two novel methods for preparation of substituted and stiochiometric oxide materials. A combination of characterization methods, including X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, are required to understand the structure of these complicated materials. Often times, more advanced characterization, such as neutron diffraction and extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements, provide the necessary insights to understanding the structures and properties of oxide catalysts. In this dissertation, preparation and characterization are emphasized for ionic PGM and oxide catalysts. Pd-substituted LnFeO3 (Ln = Y, La) showed promising results for increased stabilization of Pd ions under methane partial oxidation conditions. Microwave-assisted heating methods were employed to prepare these materials very rapidly. With just several minutes of microwave-assisted heating, Pd--substituted perovskite materials were prepared for characterization and testing. With the help of our collaborators, Pd--substituted LaFeO3 was applied as a catalyst precursor material for aryl chloride coupling under mild conditions. Initial work on Pd--substitution in CeO2 has lead to the development of ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) as a method for preparing substituted oxides having relatively high surface area. Phase pure Pd--substituted perovskites were also prepared using this technique. Methane partial oxidation reactions on Pd--substituted CeO2 provided some understanding of Pd substitution in oxides. It was determined that ionic Pd when substituted in CeO2 is readily reduced to fcc-Pd. Investigation of more complex oxides that could stabilize ionic Pd under reducing conditions through inductive effects became the target of subsequent research. While platinum group metal species have been intensively examined, less is know about reactivity associated with ionic PGMs in oxides. Using ionic species could be a route to achieving more efficient conversion of mixed hydrocarbon feedstocks to fuels and commodity chemicals. The work presented in this dissertation focuses on Pd--substitution in binary and complex oxides along with model compounds containing noble metals, with the aim of preparing an inexpensive and robust C--H bond activation catalyst. With an emphasis on preparation methods and careful characterization, it has been a goal of this work to establish structure--property relationships in oxide catalysts. The focus was shifted to model compounds, noble metal complex oxides, La2BaPdO5 and La2BaPtO5, already having unique noble metal sites. The thermal stability of these complex oxides compared to binary oxides was both an attractive property for probing ionic PGM catalysis and a fascinating feature, worthy of further investigation. Using density functional theory, the electronic structures of La2BaPdO 5 and La2BaPtO5 were compared to those of the binary PdO and PtO oxides. It was determined that a shift in the O 2p band is responsible for the increased stability in complex oxides. Platinum group metals (PGMs) are well established and widely used for catalytic processes. It has been demonstrated that PGMs can be superior catalysts for hydrocarbon conversion reactions compared to the industry standard. However, the findings in academic labs cannot always translate directly to industrial usage. One limitation to using PGMs for large scale processes is sometimes cost. Access to an inexpensive and highly efficient catalyst could be a step towards using recovered hydrocarbons, in the form of natural gas and shale gas, more widely for energy production.",,,
725,MIP-Coated Microbeam Mass Sensing Utilizing Noise Squeezing Effect in Parametric Resonance,"A real-time explosive gas sensing (DNT) in atmospheric pressure utilizing the noise squeezing eect that occurs before a bifurcation event is investigated. A noise-squeezing controller based on the statistics of phase noise is implemented using high-speed Lab- VIEW eld programmable gated array. A high frequency TNT-molecularly imprinted xed-xed microbeam sensor utilizes this nontraditional sensing strategy and performs DNT sensing at various concentrations. Experiments are conducted using both noisebased and sweep-based bifurcation tracking for a direct comparison. Results demonstrate noise-based bifurcation tracking is not only capable of performing reliable frequency tracking, but also show the method is superior to the bifurcation sweep-based tracking. Over three orders of magnitude improvement in acquisition rate is achieved, and as a result, condence and precision on bifurcation frequency estimation is signi- cantly improved over the bifurcation sweep tracking method, enabling DNT sensing at concentrations much below sub-ppb (parts-per-billion) level.",,,
726,Radical Storytelling: Reading Chicana Survival Narratives,"In my study, I propose a theory of ""transformative narrativity,"" a type of radical storytelling that builds bridges between survivors, activists, literature and social movements. Through interdisciplinary methods, I also explore what I denominate as ""survival narratives"" by examining rape discourse in several politically charged texts, The House on Mango Street (1984) by Sandra Cisneros, So Far From God (1992) by Ana Castillo, and Black Widow's Wardrobe (1999) by Lucha Corpi. Each describes a process of politicization that occurs for survivors of sexual violence when they understand the social conditions under which they have been victimized and choose to resist. In these case studies, by applying the lens of woman of color feminist theory to the hermeneutics of cultural production, I also engage with a formal textual analysis based on Chicana literary criticism that identifies social protest literature as a subversive act of resistance against structural oppression. Structural inequity makes women, racial/ethnic minorities, queer people, and people in poverty particularly susceptible to violence in the United States. Because of the failure of state-funded anti-violence models to combat the oppressive structures that facilitate abuse of women specifically, it is more critical than ever that activist scholars help understand and meet the needs of survivors by continuing to encourage radical art forms as pathways to education and awareness. While Chicana literature has garnered more critical attention in the past two decades, nevertheless, there has not been a comprehensive study of how gender violence is represented within it. My dissertation brings these issues to the forefront of academia and places Mexican American women as central to the development of self-determining communities in the United States. It is a contribution to the study of violence against women, but most specifically Chicanas. My ultimate aim is to identify potential areas in Chicana narratives that can spark collective struggle, and inspire alternative forms of anti-violence action. Radical storytelling is resistance through representation, art as activism, and writing as revolution.",,,
727,Latent Class Typologies of Defending Behavior in Bullying,"Bullying is reciprocally influenced by the interplay between individuals and their broader social environment. Considering the significant influence of peers on bullying and victimization during adolescence, it is important to consider the potential influence of bystanders. A particularly important group of students to understand are the students who engage in defending behavior---those children who tend to take the victim's side, support or console the victim, and/or intervene on behalf of the victim. There is lack of empirical evidence examining the personal correlates of defending behavior. This study used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify defender groups during middle school. Participants included 695 seventh and eighth grade students. Gender and grade were included in the study to examine the roles they play in determining defender class membership, and levels of hope, empathy, social self-efficacy, and school connectedness were examined to see if they differed across the defending typologies that emerged. LCA analyses yielded three defender classes based on frequency (i.e., Defender, Sometimes-Defender, Infrequent-Defender) rather than type (e.g., physical, verbal, relational). The results indicated that females were more likely to report engaging in defending behavior than males. Overall, the Defender class reported higher levels of empathy, pathways thinking, and social self-efficacy than the Sometimes-Defender and Infrequent-Defender classes. Further research and potential implications for targeted intervention are discussed.",,,
728,"School Psychology Around the Globe: Examining Relationships with Economical, Cultural, Educational, and Professional Variables","Furthermore, no significant differences were found between different mean levels of child autonomy for any of the three examined variables. The results are discussed with regard to previous and future research, limitations, and implications for the presence, preparation, and practice of school psychology at an international level. Professionals in the field of school psychology in 47 countries completed the School Psychology International Survey (SPIS), which includes 83 multi-part items that address the nature and status of school psychology in their countries. Data from 43 countries were used due to missing items on multiple variables for four countries. Items from the SPIS were utilized, along with available data from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) World Factbook, World Bank Group, and World Values Survey for each of the 43 countries. Simultaneous logistic regressions and independent samples t-tests were conducted to determine associations and mean differences among the abovementioned economic, cultural, educational, and professional variables. Results indicated that GDP, public spending on education, and public support for education did not significantly predict the ratio of school psychologists to students, level of degree offered, and status of school psychologists. Despite the fact that the field of school psychology continues to develop rapidly in many regions around the world, little information is available about the training, roles, and responsibilities of school psychologists. The present study provides valuable information by expanding upon previous international school psychology research by investigating key factors that influence the presence, preparation, and practice of school psychology. More specifically, the present study examined the effect of gross domestic product (GDP), public spending on education, and public support for education on the ratio of school psychologists to students, level of degree offered, and status of school psychologists. Country differences on child autonomy with respect to the ratio of school psychologists to students, level of degree offered, and status of school psychologists were also investigated.",,,
729,Reducing Disruptive Behavior of Siblings of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder during Treatment Sessions,"Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) is an empirically based behavioral treatment for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Using parent-child dyads as the mode of intervention, parents are taught specific motivational treatment skills to use with their children with ASD. When conducting PRT in the home, there exist the additional complexities of everyday living such as the presence of siblings. A sibling who exhibits disruptive behavior in an effort to gain the parent's attention can result in the treatment session being interrupted. There is little research to date on how to mitigate the difficulties of implementing PRT when there is a disruptive sibling present. The current study employed a multiple baseline design to compare the traditional parent-child dyad model to an intervention tailored to the needs of the sibling in addition to the conventional dyad. Three triads participated in this study: a 3-year-old child with ASD and her typically-developing 5-year-old brother and their mother, a 10-year-old child with ASD and his typically-developing 7-year-old brother and their mother, and a 9-year-old with ASD and his typically-developing 4-year-old brother and their mother. The results showed that with an intervention that addressed the siblings' needs, the frequency of sibling disruptive behavior decreased. The intervention also resulted in an increase of positive affect for the mother, child with ASD, and the sibling, and did not detract from the presentation of treatment opportunities for the children with ASD to work towards their respective treatment goals. Furthermore, the children with ASD made progress towards their respective treatment goals. These results generalized and maintained. The findings are discussed with regard to theoretical and clinical significance.",,,
731,Community policing in action: Negotiating epistemic authority in civilian-initiated service encounters1,"Research on officer-civilian interactions has identified widespread interactional problems with investigative policing practices, governed by the hierarchical status and authority of officers. To combat these effects and foster rapport between officers and civilians, police departments worldwide have established community-oriented policing (COP) programs. While scholars have investigated how officers and civilians perceive the benefits of these programs, however, research has yet to examine the actual face-to-face interactions of officers and civilians in non-investigative contexts. The current study moves this research forward by analyzing video data of 30 interactions between community police officers and civilians. Taken from a larger corpus of officer-civilian interactions in a major metropolitan city in the U.S. that established its formal COP program in the late 1980s, these data reveal how police officers and civilians have expanded the role of officers in non-urgent, civilian-initiated interactions beyond that expected in investigative contexts. In particular, this interactional context reveals how officers and civilians negotiate an alignment as community members through displays of epistemic authority about the city.",,,
732,Structure-Processing Relationships in Solution Processable Polymer Thin Film Transistors and Small Molecule Bulk Heterojunction Solar Cells,"BHJ layer morphology, which has been shown to be highly dependent on processing, has a significant effect on OPV performance. It is postulated that optimal BHJ morphologies consist of discrete bicontinuous nanoscale domains of each moiety, on the order of the exciton diffusion length, which extend vertically from each electrode, thereby increasing the surface area of the domains and forming continuous conducting pathways for efficient charge extraction and transfer. An optimal morphology, however, is seldom achieved during film formation; therefore, a number of processing techniques, such as thermal and sol vent annealing, and the addition of solvent additives to the casting solution have been explored to control the morphology in order to attain the multiple structural requirements. Solvent additive processing, a technique that is used in most record performing polymer:fullerene BHJ solar cell devices, involves the addition of small volumes of a high boiling point liquid to the BHJ casting solu- tion. Solvent additive processing, with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive, has recently been employed in solution processable small molecule (SPSM) BHJ systems, showing similar drastic effects on several device metrics and ultimately the power conversion efficiency (PCE). A recent SPSM study delineates how the volume of solvent additive used affects device performance: when 0.4 v/v% of DIO was used, the PCE increased from 1.8 to 7%, while a deterioration in the PCE to less than 1% occurred when only 1 v/v% of DIO was used. A regio-regular (RR) conjugated copolymer based on cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4- b]dithiophene (CDT) and pyridal[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PT) structural units was prepared by using polymerization reactions involving reactants specifically designed to avoid random orientation of the asymmetric PT heterocycle. Compared to its regio-irregular (RI) counterpart, the RR polymer exhibits a two orders of magnitude increase in hole mobility from 0.005 to 0.6 cm2V -1s-1. To probe the reason for this difference in mobility, we examined the crystalline structure and its orientation in thin films of both copolymers as a function of depth via grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). In the RI film, the pi-pi stacking direction of the crystallites is mainly perpendicular to the substrate normal (edge-on orientation) while in the RR film the crystallites adopt a mixed pi-pi stacking orientation in the center of the film as well as near the interface between the polymer and the dielectric layer. These results demonstrate that control of backbone regularity is another important design criterion to consider in the synthesis and optimization of new conjugated copolymers with asymmetric structural units. Solution processed organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) have emerged as a promising sustainable energy technology due to their ease of fabrication, potential to enable low-cost manufacturing, and ability to be incorporated onto light-weight flexible substrates. To date, the most efficacious OPV device architecture, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ), consists of a blend of a light-harvesting conjugated organic electron donating molecule and a strong electron-accepting compound (usually a soluble fullerene derivative e.g. [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). Several structural characterization techniques, such as grazing incidence wide and small-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS and GISAXS), and energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM), were used to investigate structure-processing-property relationships in additive-treated SPSM BHJ films and were correlated to device performance. Scattering experiments showed that the use of additives had several effects on the structure of the BHJ at multiple length scales: e.g. the number and orientation of SPSM crystallites, different pi-pi stacking distances, and the nano-scale domain size. Additionally, EF-TEM further verified the effect of additives on the domain size and was complemented with tomographic reconstructions to provide a 3D representation of the BHJ morphology due to solvent additive processing. Finally, in situ GIWAXS was also performed to investigate the kinetics of crystallite formation during and shortly after spin-casting. The additive was shown to induce a complex structural evolution effect on the microstructure of SPSMs by inciting the formation of a metastable polymorph and enhanced crystalline quality of the SPSM during and shortly after casting, whereas the non-additive treated SPSM structure was static after initial crystallite formation. The results from this study have important implications for future optimization and design of solvent additive processed SPSM BHJ blends for OPV devices.",,,
733,Enriching Representation: Finding the Voice and Perspective of Children in California History Museums,"This dissertation explores how California history museums represent the history of children and childhood. This work is inspired by earlier studies in the fields of anthropology, sociology, museum studies, and public history that question and analyze the underrepresentation or misrepresentation of groups, such as women and ethnic minorities, in US museums. How US museums represent children and their history has yet to receive scholarly attention. This dissertation contributes to filling this gap in the literature and bases its conclusions on a state-wide survey of more than 200 California museums, interviews with 110 museum professionals or volunteers, site visits to 40 museums, and in-depth field research at 10 museums. I argue that too often the experiences, stories, and contributions of children are overlooked, absent, or marginalized in California history museums. When representations of children's history do emerge, they often reflect ideals rather than realities, universalize the historical experience of childhood, and, in the process, romanticize the past. This dissertation acknowledges obstacles that get in the way of richer representation and offers potential solutions. During my study it became clear that multiple meanings of children's history are at work in the California museum community: the history of children, history for children, and history by children. This dissertation examines each in turn and demonstrates how conceptions of children, many with deep historical roots, influence not only museum exhibitions but also programming for children. Central to this dissertation is the study of history by children at the Pasadena Museum of History, which provides middle-school students the opportunity to teach history as docents to younger children. Drawing upon my three years of participant observation at this site and interviews with forty middle-school students, I contend that inviting children to participate, create, and co-produce in museum spaces improves children's attitudes towards museums, enriches representation, and brings to light perspectives that may otherwise remain marginalized.",,,
734,"The South is All to Me Now: Caroline Howard Gilman, Southern Womanhood and Transregional Identity","Additionally, the Gilmans supported a number of benevolent associations in Charleston and championed temperance reform, which in the South had only a limited following at best. This study employs the term ""transregional"" to describe the unique perspective of the Gilmans. Their social and regional fluidity, developed from transregional encounters, influenced social and kin networks in both regions. This dissertation therefore adds to a growing literature that complicates traditional explanations of sectional distinctiveness by recognizing the existence of a disparate white, urban, professional middle-class who desired reform. This dissertation also cautions against exaggerated claims of southern modernity by considering how Gilman, in identifying as southern, consequently accepted, at least publicly, a number of southern values discordant with the more liberal position she advocated on behalf of women. This dissertation considers how class, religion and regional identity intersected in antebellum Charleston through a detailed analysis of the life and writings of Caroline Howard Gilman. Gilman, a northerner by birth, relocated to Charleston with her husband Samuel in 1819 when he was selected to minister to the City's only Unitarian Church. As the editor of a successful southern periodical and a national woman's almanac, as well as minister's wife, Gilman challenged the traditional gender roles of southern women. Gilman organized and supported benevolent associations with missions that differed from traditional modes of southern charity while expanding women's social networks and public presence. She also endeavored to change southern attitudes regarding female education, which typically provided little intellectual opportunity for women, especially in comparison with the North. Slavery permeated cultural values so intensely that widespread change or collective action was almost impossible, and the Gilmans limited any real challenges to the institution of slavery to private acts. Their experiences highlight the possibilities of northern influence while simultaneously exposing the realities of what it meant to be southern.",,,
735,Automated Design of Optimal Medium Access Control Protocols for Wireless Networking,"Third, we formulate the automated optimal MAC protocol generation problem for dynamic topologies, as encountered in wireless ad hoc networks, under multiple neighborhoods and in the presence of acknowledgments. The probability distribution over the set of local topologies encountered in the global network serves as a model for which an optimization program may be formulated that takes the per-node average throughput as its objective function. Symbolic Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate the optimization program, which is subsequently solved via state-of-the-art nonlinear solvers. A quantitative comparison with the standard RTS/CTS protocol provides information on the value of side information on the probability distribution of local topologies, which RTS/CTS does not presume. Our investigations of computational complexity show that the time to generate the program dominates over the time to solve the resulting non-linear program, and that the complete program can be solved within a reasonable computational time. We present a framework for the automated design of optimal Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols for wireless networks. This thesis opens the way for the design of an automated design flow chain for network protocols that are based only on local information, of which MAC protocols constitute an example. In the future, our framework can be integrated as a ''back end'' to Software Defined Networks (SDN's) which are envisioned to run on optimizable protocols as the ones described in this thesis. Fourth, we formulate the automated optimal MAC protocol generation problem under dynamic traffic conditions for multiple neighborhoods and in the presence of acknowledgments. We show that the problem can be formulated as a functional optimization program in which each design (a.k.a. decision) function of the program is the probability that a node takes an action given its knowledge state, as a function of the effective traffic demand at the current time at that node. In order to achieve a viable computational complexity for the functional optimization program, we discretize the effective traffic demands by virtue of which a look-up table is produced for each design function. Structurally different MAC protocols can be represented in this framework, and are generated automatically with respect to traffic demand. The symbolic Monte Carlo method is used to generate an approximate expression for the objective function as well as for the non-linear constraints, in a manner that trades off accuracy versus computational complexity. Symbolic simulation results are presented for a fixed network topology under the assumption of Poisson traffic. The objective is to minimize the average power consumption of a node subject to a minimum average throughput constraint that incorporates soft delay guarantees. Our research demonstrates that a MAC protocol that incorporates acknowledgments in a multi-hop setting under dynamic traffic can be generated automatically. Second, we generate optimal MAC protocols based on a more general MAC model that incorporates multiple MAC neighborhoods as well as acknowledgments. In this model, both the advertisement and acknowledgment frames are automatically generated by an optimization program that is built based on symbolic Monte Carlo simulation. The design flow chain produces an optimal MAC protocol with respect to the desired objective function. First, we describe a methodology that incorporates the impact of control information transfer into MAC protocol optimization. We apply this methodology to the problem of a synchronous broadcast MAC channel in order to generate the optimal protocol when the objective function is the average network throughput per time slot. We describe a recursive procedure for the symbolic generation of the optimization program for any choice of the objective function. We demonstrate that this methodology subsumes two structurally different types of protocols, namely, pure random access protocols and protocols with data advertisements, as special cases of the regimes where they are optimal. We examine the scaling of the optimal throughput and the computational complexity as a function of the number of nodes and the control lifetime.",,,
736,The design and modeling of periodic materials with novel properties,"A variety of other novel and previously studied ordered foam topologies are also presented that are largely representative of the spectrum of performance of such materials, shedding insight into the behavior of all cellular materials. Cellular materials are ubiquitous in our world being found in natural and engineered systems as structural materials, sound and energy absorbers, heat insulators and more. Stochastic foams made of polymers, metals and even ceramics find wide use due to their novel properties when compared to monolithic materials. Properties of these so called hybrid materials, those that combine materials or materials and space, are derived from the localization of thermomechanical stresses and strains on the mesoscale as a function of cell topology. The effects of localization can only be generalized in stochastic materials arising from their inherent potential complexity, possessing variations in local chemistry, microstructural inhomogeneity and topological variations. Ordered cellular materials on the other hand, such as lattices and honeycombs, make for much easier study, often requiring analysis of only a single unit-cell. properties completely unmatched by monolithic materials. In the first chapter of this thesis a two-dimensional lattice is detailed that possess near maximum stiffness, relative to the tightest theoretical bound, and low, zero and even appreciably negative thermal expansion. Its CTE and stiffness are given in closed form as a function of geometric parameters and the material properties. This result is confirmed with finite elements (FE) and experiment. In the second chapter the compressive stiffness of three-dimensional ordered foams, both closed and open cell, are predicted with FE and the results placed in property space in terms of stiffness and density. A novel structure is identified that effectively achieves theoretical bounds for Young's, shear and bulk modulus simultaneously, over a wide range of relative densities, greatly expanding the property space of available materials with a pragmatic manufacturable structure. Theoretical bounds predict that hybrid materials have the potential to push design envelopes offering lighter stiffer and stronger materials. Hybrid materials can achieve very low and even negative coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) while retaining a relatively high stiffness --",,,
737,A Cultural Historical Activity Theory Perspective of Teacher Learning in the Edmodo Math Subject Community,"Data analysis revealed that the participants were driven by the contradictions and limitations of their local school activity systems to take control of their learning and find knowledge in the Math Subject Community. The participants' ability to find knowledge was defined by the roles they performed in the community, the tools they used, the collective knowledge of the community, and the implicit community rules of reciprocity and professionalism. The participants' ability to select and implement the knowledge they found in the Math Subject Community in their classrooms was shaped by their local school activity system tools, the support of their colleagues and administration, their students' range in math abilities, and the community rules. Overall, the participants felt that engaging in this process of acquiring knowledge allowed them to make changes, both small and large, in their teaching and learning strategies. Teachers are participating in online communities in ever increasing numbers to find and share knowledge with educators around the world. However, the majority of the studies on online communities of practice often fail to examine the process of knowledge sharing as a complex, dynamically evolving practice that is shaped by local classroom and school contexts as well as other sociocultural factors. This study was designed to address the need for a more comprehensive and multifaceted exploration of teacher learning in an online community of practice. A Cultural Historical Activity Theory (Leontiev, 1978; Engestrom, 1987; Cole and Engestrom, 1993; Vygotsky, 1978) framework was used as a guide for examining how teachers acquired and made use of the shared knowledge from the Edmodo Math Subject Community, an online community of practice with more than 250,000 members. Multiple data types were collected in order to examine the teachers' object-oriented actions in two overlapping activity systems. A Model of Teacher Knowledge Acquisition was developed to display the participants' fluid, ongoing process of navigating between two overlapping activity systems to find new knowledge. The Model of Teacher Knowledge Acquisition presents teacher learning as a complex, socially constructed process that is influenced by multiple activity systems that interact with and shape one another.",,,
738,Microscale solution manipulation using photopolymerized hydrogel membranes and induced charge electroosmosis micropumps,"I first describe a microfluidic pump that uses an electrokinetic effect, Induced-Charge Electroosmosis (ICEO), to generate pressure on-chip. In ICEO, steady flows are driven by AC fields along metal-electrolyte interfaces. I design and microfabricate a pump that exploits this effect to generate on-chip pressures. The ICEO pump is used to drive flow along a microchannel, and the pressure is measured as a function of voltage, frequency, and electrolyte composition. This is the first demonstration of chip-scale flows driven by ICEO, which opens the possibility for ICEO pumping in self-contained microfluidic devices. Next, I demonstrate a method to create thin local membranes between microchannels, which enables local diffusive delivery of solute. These ``Hydrogel Membrane Microwindows'' are made by photopolymerizing a hydrogel which serves as a local ``window'' for solute diffusion and electromigration between channels, but remains a barrier to flow. I demonstrate three novel experimental capabilities enabled by the hydrogel membranes: local concentration gradients, local electric currents, and rapid diffusive composition changes. Microfluidic technology is playing an ever-expanding role in advanced chemical and biological devices, with diverse applications including medical diagnostics, high throughput research tools, chemical or biological detection, separations, and controlled particle fabrication. Even so, local (microscale) modification of solution properties within microchannels, such as pressure, solute concentration, and voltage remains a challenge, and improved spatiotemporal control would greatly enhance the capabilities of microfluidics. This thesis demonstrates and characterizes two microfluidic tools to enhance local solution control. I conclude by applying the hydrogel membranes to study solvophoresis, the migration of particles in solvent gradients. Solvent gradients are present in many chemical processes, but migration of particles within these gradients is not well understood. An improved understanding would allow solvophoresis to be engineered (e.g. for coatings and thin film deposition) or reduced (e.g. in fouling processes during reactions and separations). Toward this end, I perform velocity measurements of colloidal particles at various ethanol-water concentrations and gradient strengths. The velocity was found to depend on the mole fraction via the equation u = DSP&dtri;ln X, where u is the velocity, DSP is the mobility, and X is the ethanol mole fraction.",,,
739,Systemic Risk Illustrated,"Due to the recent financial crisis, systemic risk is becoming a central research topic. In this study, we propose a simple model of inter-bank borrowing and lending where the evolution of the log-monetary reserves of N banks is described by a system of diffusion processes coupled through their drifts in such a way that stability of the system depends on the rate of inter-bank borrowing and lending. Systemic risk is characterized by the non-negligible probability of a large number of defaults. In order to study the behavior of this coupled system, we discuss the comparison of the coupled diffusions not only coupled through the drift and non-drift but correlated through Brownian motions. In addition, we introduce a game feature in the lending and borrowing system where each bank controls its own rate of borrowing from or lending to the central bank under a quadratic cost. The optimization reflects the desire of each bank to borrow from the central bank when its monetary reserve falls below a critical level or lend if it rises above this critical level which is chosen here as the average monetary reserve. The equilibria with finitely many players are solved explicitly and the financial implication is that the central bank acts as a clearing house, adding liquidity to the system without affecting its systemic risk. We also study the corresponding Mean Field Game in the limit of large number of banks in the presence of a common noise. Finally, we consider two inhomogeneous unsymmetrical grouping problems where banks have strategies using heterogeneous parameters and obtain that the central bank must provide extra cash into the system or keep deposits for banks in order to stabilize this bank system using the heterogeneity framework.",,,
740,Parental Substance Abuse and Child Neglect: Findings from a Family Treatment Drug Court,"Child neglect is the most common form of child maltreatment, and yet less recognized, treated, or researched than child physical or sexual abuse. Child neglect is also highly associated with parental substance abuse, parents' trauma histories, and trauma symptoms. This study explores the relation between parental substance abuse, parental history of trauma and trauma-related symptoms, and child neglect within a sample of families involved in a family treatment drug court (FTDC) for parental substance abuse and child neglect. Data were collected on 70 mothers and fathers who became involved with the FTDC because they neglected their children as a result of their substance abuse. Parental substance abuse was assessed at intake using a semi-structured clinical interview. Parents' trauma history, trauma symptoms, and parenting attitudes were collected using self-report measures. A trained clinician assessed family functioning and parenting techniques. The severity of parents' alcohol problems and trauma histories were found to impact their use of adaptive parenting techniques. Parents' trauma symptoms and trauma histories were found to differentially impact the parent-child relationship; children of parents with more severe trauma symptoms were at a greater risk of neglect while children of parents who experienced four or more adverse childhood experiences were at a lower risk of neglect. Parents' trauma histories and experience of childhood neglect also impacted treatment gains. Recommendations for assessing parents' trauma histories and symptoms as they relate to substance abuse and child welfare treatment planning are discussed. Methods to improve the study of child neglect are also identified as they pertain to families affected by substance abuse and trauma.",,,
741,Risk and Protective Factors Associated With Latina/o Academic Outcomes : A Latent Class Analysis,"Results indicated four distinct academic risk classes. The classes revealed complex patterns of extracurricular involvement, academic discussions with parents, and social cognitive factors. The profiles were labeled as follows: Highly Engaged, Low School Engagement, Low Individual Engagement , and Low Parental Engagement. The Highly Engaged class had the lowest risk across all three academic outcomes. That is the Highly Engaged class had the highest twelfth grade mean mathematics achievement score, was the class most likely to attend postsecondary, and least likely to dropout. In contrast the Low Parental Engagement class had the highest risk across all three academic outcomes. Results indicate that using the Highly Engaged class as the reference group, students who did not attend preschool were significantly more to be represented in the Low Parental Engagement or Low School Engagement classes. Male students were significantly more likely to be in the Low Parental Engagement class. Students who were not low-income were less likely to be represented in the Low Parental Engagement class and Low School Engagement classes. Also, 10th grade mathematics were significant predictors for student in the Low Parental Engagement class, Low School Engagement, and Low Individual Engagement classes. Students whose native language was not English were less likely to be in the Low Individual Engagement class. Implications of the findings and limitations are discussed. The study examined the role of risk and protective influences among high school Latino/a students by using a sample from the Education Longitudinal Study (ELS: 2002). A clustering approach was used to create profiles comprising a variety of variables, including students' involvement in extracurricular, home-based parental involvement, and social cognitive factors that are typically thought of as risk factors for school completion, mathematics achievement, and enrollment in postsecondary education. Latent class analyses (LCA) was used to identify the academic risk groups, assess academic risk group differences with respect to key covariates including gender, SES, immigrant status, whether English is a student's native language, preschool attendance, and 10th grade mathematics. This study assessed academic risk group differences with respect to 12th grade mathematics achievement, dropout rates, and enrollment in postsecondary education.",,,
742,Marine Siderophores: Structure and Biosynthesis,"The majority of bacteria need iron to grow. However, in an aerobic, pH neutral environment, the low solubility of Fe(OH)3 (Ksp=10 -39) limits the concentration of bioavailable iron to levels far below that which is required for cellular function. Pathogenic and marine bacteria face additional challenges in obtaining sufficient levels of iron because both live in very low iron environments. A shared iron acquisition strategy of marine and pathogenic bacteria is to produce and secrete siderophores into their surroundings. Siderophores are low molecular weight, organic compounds with high affinity for iron(III). Through genome mining, a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster resembling the enterobactin biosynthetic cluster is identified in the bioluminescent quorum-sensing model bacterium, V. harveyi. A predicted fatty acid CoA ligase (FACL) in the vicinity of the enterobactin biosynthetic cluster suggests that V. harveyi may produce amphiphilic enterobactin-like siderophores. Extraction of the bacterial cell pellet of V. harveyi leads to the isolation and structure determination of a suite of eight amphi-enterobactin siderophores comprised of three 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-L-serine residues and one acyl-L-serine arranged in a cyclic tetraseryl lactone scaffold. Gene knock-out studies confirm the involvement of the FACL and NRPS gene is the biosynthesis of the amphi-enterobactin siderophores. Biochemical characterization of the recombinant NRPS protein guides the postulation of a model for the biosynthesis of the amphi-enterobactin siderophores. This work is focused on the investigations into siderophore production of two marine microbes, the bioluminescent Vibrio harveyi ATCC BAA-1116 and an oil-degrading Pseudoalteromonas sp.. A Pseudoalteromonas sp. was isolated from the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The bacterium is determined to have hydrocarbon degrading capabilities, measured by its' growth in a medium supplemented with crude oil as the only carbon source. When grown in an iron-limited medium, three peptidic siderophores are isolated from the culture supernatant, composed of serine, asparagine, two formylated/hydroxylated ornithines, dihydroxy benzoic acid and a very unusual nonproteinogenic amino acid, 4,8-diamino-3-hydroxyoctanoic acid. The iron-binding properties of the siderophores are investigated through spectrophotometric titration. Cosmid library construction and screening leads to the identification of three cosmids potentially harboring the biosynthetic gene cluster.",,,
743,Growth Optimization of Metal-polar III-Nitride High-electron-mobility Transistor Structures by Molecular Beam Epitaxy,"The growth of InAlN/(GaN)/(AlN)/GaN heterostructures with lattice-matched In0.17Al0.83N barriers by N-rich PAMBE is also described. Through flux optimization, the columnar microstructure previously observed in N-rich PAMBE-grown InAlN layers was eliminated. By including a 3 nm AlN interlayer and 2 nm GaN interlayer, an In0.17Al0.83N/GaN/AlN/GaN heterostructure regrown on low-TDD FS GaN achieved an exceptionally low RT 2DEG sheet resistance of 145 &ohm;/&squ;. The effects of threading dislocations on the gate leakage and channel conductivity of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs were studied in detail. For this purpose, a series of HEMT structures were grown on GaN templates with threading dislocation densities (TDDs) that spanned three orders of magnitude. There was a clear trend of reduced gate leakage with reduced TDD for HEMTs grown by Ga-rich PAMBE; however, a reduction in TDD also entailed an increase in buffer leakage. By reducing the unintentionally doped (UID) GaN buffer thickness and including an AlGaN back barrier, a HEMT regrown by Ga-rich PAMBE on low-TDD free-standing (FS) GaN (~5 x 107 cm-2 TDD) yielded a three-terminal breakdown voltage greater than 50 V and a power output (power-added efficiency) of 6.7 W/mm (50 %) at 4 GHz with a 40 V drain bias. High TDD was then shown to severely degrade the 2DEG mobility of AlxGa1-xN/GaN (x = 0.24, 0.12, 0.06) and AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterostructures grown by Ga-rich PAMBE. By regrowing on low-TDD FS GaN and including a 2.5 nm AlN interlayer, an Al0.24Ga0.76N/AlN/GaN heterostructure achieved a room temperature (RT) 2DEG sheet resistance of 169 &ohm;/&squ;. As evidenced by atom probe tomography, the AlN interlayer grown by Ga-rich PAMBE was pure with abrupt interfaces. The pure AlN interlayer greatly reduced alloy-related scattering. When AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterostructures were grown by NH3-MBE at 820 C, the 2DEG sheet density was lower than expected. These AlN interlayers were shown to have a significant concentration of Ga impurities by atom probe tomography. The source of these impurities was most likely the decomposition of the underlying GaN layers, as reduction of the growth temperature below 750 C yielded a much lower concentration of Ga impurities. Flux optimization and application of an In surfactant was necessary to reduce the interface roughness in AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterostructures grown by NH3-MBE at low temperature, yielding sheet resistances below 300 &ohm;/&squ;. GaN-based high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) will play an important role in the next generation of high-frequency amplifiers and power-switching devices. Since parasitic conduction (leakage) through the GaN buffer layer and (Al,Ga,In)N barrier reduces the efficiency of operation, HEMT performance hinges on the epitaxial quality of these layers. Increasing the sheet charge density and mobility of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is also essential for reducing the channel resistance and improving output. The growth conditions applied in plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) and ammonia-based molecular beam epitaxy (NH3-MBE) that result in high-quality metal-polar HEMT structures are described.",,,
744,Explaining Change in Production and Distribution of Olivine-Tempered Ceramics in the Arizona Strip and Adjacent Areas in the American Southwest,"To reconstruct ceramic production and consumption pattern, laser-ablation inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was conducted on 1,069 sherds from the Mt. Trumbull/Tuweep and the lowland Virgin areas, along with source clay samples collected from the same areas. To examine how the use of clay resources changed over time, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating was conducted on 113 sherd samples with compositional information. Ultimately, the goal of this study is to understand why ceramic production and circulation patterns changed during the Ancestral Pueblo occupation of this peripheral area of the American Southwest. I hypothesize that ceramic production and regional interaction patterns were shaped in part by the need to minimize subsistence risk in this marginal agricultural environment. The data presented here suggest that different environmental conditions favored different social interaction and local ceramic production patterns. In Mt. Trumbull, under unstable climatic conditions and low population density, near the beginning of the Puebloan occupation, pots moved along with human migration. Later, when populations were higher and environmental conditions were equally unstable, pots were moved through interregional trade. In addition, clay resource specialization was favored early but was replaced later by exclusive use of optimal clays when population numbers were higher. In the lowland Virgin area, exchange played an important role as a risk minimization strategy throughout the Puebloan occupation, but clay-resource specialization gained importance later on, when populations increased. The Arizona Strip and adjacent areas in Utah and Nevada are in a very marginal environment. This dissertation investigates how small-scale farmers who survived more than 1000 years in this area coped with the challenges of this marginal environment by examining how and why social interaction patterns varied over time in different parts of the region. Artifact assemblages from this area that date between A.D. 200 and 1350 are characterized by widely distributed ceramics tempered with olivine, a volcanic mineral. Sources of olivine lie in the vicinity of Mt. Trumbull and Tuweep, near the northwestern part of the Grand Canyon. The olivine-tempered ceramics were distributed mostly westward from Mt. Trumbull, up to 100 km to the lowland Virgin area in southern Nevada.",,,
745,The Characteristics of Organic Youth Mentoring Relationships: A Qualitative Study,"Naturally occurring mentoring relationships, interchangeably referred to as organic mentorships, have been defined as an emotional bond between a youth and nonparental adult, who provides support and guidance to the youth as a result of the relationship being developed without the assistance of a program designed to foster such connection among youth and adults (DuBois & Karcher, 2005). Natural mentors, or important nonparental adults who youth encounter through their existing social networks, are an important resource for at-risk Latino/a youth as they transition to adulthood. Natural mentoring research to date has primarily investigated the presence or absence of a mentoring relationship and its affect on youth outcomes. An extensive, exploratory, qualitative method was employed to analyze specific relationship qualities and processes among high-risk Latino/a youth and their adult natural mentors. Eight Latino/a youth individuals (3 females and 5 males) and three adult mentors (1 female and 2 males) participated in the study. The results indicated that both youth and adult participants had individual characteristics that promoted and supported the connectedness and emotional bond in their natural mentoring relationships. Furthermore, the findings implied that bonding through shared life experiences and the mentor altering the relationship according to the needs of the youth could help cultivate long-lasting and meaningful relationships for high-risk Latino/a youth and their natural adult mentors. Several domains and core ideas emerged, which are consistent with the previous theoretical literature, as well as some new findings.",,,
746,On decay properties of solutions to the IVP for the Benjamin-Ono equation,"In particular, the problems of establishing local and global well-posedness under minimal regularity requirement of the given data, the long-time behavior of local solutions to these models, scattering, blow-up, and the unique continuation properties of the solutions have been extensively studied. In recent years there has been an intense activity in the study of harmonic analysis and its application to partial differential equations (PDEs). The tools of harmonic analysis assist in the discovery of important properties of certain PDEs; amid these PDEs one finds the study of nonlinear dispersive equations. Among the systems considered one finds the Korteweg-de Vries equation, the Schrosystem and the Benjamin-Ono equation, all occurring in different physical problems, mainly nonlinear wave propagation. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, these all admit solitary wave solutions called traveling waves, which have important applications in fiber optics, magnetics and genetics. In this thesis we investigate unique continuation properties of solutions to the initial value problem associated to the Benjamin-Ono equation given in weighted Sobolev spaces. More precisely, we prove that the uniqueness property based on a decay requirement at three times cannot be lowered to two times even by imposing stronger decay on the initial data.",,,
747,Transcriptional Activation by Islet1 Isoforms,"The present study examined the role of alternative splicing as a mechanism to create neuronal diversity within the developing retina. The Isl1 gene has two alternatively spliced isoforms, alpha and beta, that are present in the developing retina. The Isl1beta isoform lacks a critical portion of a protein-binding domain with which Isl1 binds to Lhx3 in a known transcriptional complex (Isl1:Lhx3:Ldb1). Developmental analysis of Isl1 expression reveals the Isl1alpha isoform is expressed at higher levels than Isl1beta throughout development and persisting into adulthood. Isl1 isoforms are present in distinct subsets of retinal ganglion cells, with Isl1beta-expressing cells being restricted to cells with soma sizes under 175mu2. A luciferase assay demonstrates the Isl1beta isoform is functionally distinct from Isl1alpha and is not capable of activating the Isl1:Lhx3:Ldb1 complex as Isl1alpha is. These results suggest that Isl1beta containing-complexes may have unique gene targets from Isl1alpha and implicate the alternative splicing of Isl1 as a mechanism contributing to neuronal differentiation during retinal development.",,,
748,"Facile Preparation of Mussel-inspired Adhesives: Synthesis, Tunable Adhesive Force, and Surface Coatings","The improvement of polymer properties is mainly achieved by adjusting the functionality of the polymer and changing its architecture. Developing novel materials by changing polymeric architecture and substituting functionality is attracting considerable attention from the polymer science; especially the preparation of the biomimetic polymers. Marine organisms such as mussel, barnacle and oyster stick on the wet surfaces using their adhesive proteins. These adhesions are rapid, strong, and reversible enough to survive under the conditions of the sea. The first part of this thesis is focused on the developing the facile and efficient ways to synthesize the biomimetic molecules with adhesive functionalities of marine organisms. Second, their adhesive forces was controlled through synthesis and fabrication of the novel adhesive polymeric system. Finally, versatile applicable ways to use these synthetic polymers with catecholic functionality were studied.",,,
749,Strain Relaxation in Semipolar III-Nitrides for Light Emitting Diode Applications,"Light emitting diodes (LEDs) based on the III-nitride material system (Al,In,Ga)N have been utilized in a number of commercial applications, from small Christmas tree lights to high power lightbulbs and streetlamps. Until now, all commercially available GaN-based devices have been based on the conventional c-plane (polar) orientation of the Wurtzite crystal structure, and grown heteroepitaxially on foreign substrates such as sapphire. However, the recent availability of low defect density HVPE-grown GaN substrates have opened up new possibilities to study novel crystal orientations, known as nonpolar and semipolar. The (Al,In,Ga)N material system has bandgaps ranging from 0.7 eV in the infrared out to 6.3 eV in the deep UV---and LEDs with wavelengths from roughly 365 nm (near-UV) to 550 nm (green) are commercially available. However, although blue LEDs typically have an external quantum efficiency (EQE) > 60%, at emission wavelengths beyond 500 nm the EQE drops to _ 30%. Similarly, although red-emitting LEDs based on AlInGaP have high efficiency, their EQE is also reduced for yellow wavelengths. This phenomenon is known as the 'Green Gap'. Although there are likely to be numerous factors responsible for this reduction in efficiency with emission wavelength in III-nitrides, a leading candidate is mismatch strain between the active region of the LED---consisting of thin layers of InGaN with at least 30% indium---and the GaN substrate, which have a significant lattice constant mismatch of > 3%. In order to improve the efficiency of green-emitting LEDs, strain relaxation mechanisms on semipolar orientations have been studied. By growing relaxed InGaN buffer layers, it is possible to change the lattice constant from that of the GaN substrates, reducing the mismatch strain in the active region itself. Multiple slip systems have been observed and studied in semipolar nitrides, leading to several sets of misfit dislocations (MDs) that result in relaxation of InGaN layers. The primary mechanism is basal plane slip on inclined c-planes, which results in one-dimensional relaxation only, and does not lead to any increase in defect density. The secondary mechanism of non-basal plane slip on inclined m-planes, however, leads to two-dimensional relaxation but also to the formation of a high density of new extended defects. Using relaxation via the formation of basal plane MDs, green LEDs have been grown on 1D-relaxed InGaN buffer layers with equivalent performance to reference samples. It was found that one-dimensionally relaxed InGaN buffer layers can enable the growth of thicker active regions, that in some cases result in improved performance. 1D relaxation also leads to changes in the valence band structure which affects the polarization properties of emitted light, and this has been studied both theoretically and experimentally. Finally, through the use of InGaN nanostructures, the effect of 2D relaxation on light emission has been investigated, and found to have a significant link with improved indium incorporation and efficiency in green-emitting quantum wells.",,,
750,Influences of Organic-Inorganic Surface Interactions on Crystallization in Liquid-Solid Systems,"Organic-inorganic materials including diverse oxides, biominerals and semiconductors are of considerable academic and technological interest due to the ability to tailor their properties for a wide-range of applications. The macroscopic properties of these materials depend on their chemical compositions, crystalline structures, morphologies, and the interactions between organic and inorganic components. Importantly, organic-inorganic surface interactions play a crucial role in the nucleation, growth, and hierarchical structuring of these hybrid materials. However, in many material systems the mechanisms by which organic species interact on a molecular level with inorganic components are not well understood. This is largely due to the challenges associated with the molecular characterization of interactions in heterogeneous liquid-solid mixtures of diverse components that also evolve with time. Herein, the influences of organic-inorganic surface interactions on the growth of crystalline or disordered structures are established in hydrating aluminate/silicate cements and solution-grown zinc chalcogenide nanoparticles. The molecular-level compositions, structures, and surface interactions have been measured in these diverse material systems composed of liquid and solid phases. Molecular interactions are correlated with specific structural features to identify the processes that govern the hydration or growth of these technologically important materials. Advanced one- and two-dimensional NMR techniques are primarily used to characterize surface structures where interactions with adsorbed organic species influence cement hydration or nanoparticle growth. Specifically, these measurements identify the structural transformations of closely related saccharides that account for their dramatically different influences on the hydration of aluminate and silicate species in cements. Similar characterization techniques establish the structural transformations of alkylamine surfactants exposed to carbon dioxide that lead to different shapes and supramolecular assemblies of zinc chalcogenide nanoparticles. These results help identify the processes that control cement hydration and nanoparticle growth and establish that crystallization is governed by the binding of organic molecules at specific inorganic surface sites. The new insights are expected to contribute directly and broadly towards understanding molecular-level interactions in similar systems and help establish molecular criteria for the design or selection of organic species that mediate cement hydration and nanoparticle growth.",,,
751,Dynamic Imaging of Function and Morphogenesis in the Developing Heart,"Congenital heart disease, the most common birth defect, occurs up to 5% of live births in humans. Understanding the relationship between morphology and function during development in the embryonic heart has important medical implications. Our studies focus on developing non-invasive heart imaging tools to observe the dynamics of morphogenesis while the heart is growing and functioning. Our approach consists in setting up a computer-driven automated microscope equipped with high-speed and sensitive cameras, implementing sample mounting protocols, and developing image reconstruction and analysis software. In order to improve the specificity with which structures can be imaged in the beating heart, we developed multi-modal microscopy by combining high-speed and multi-color sequences taken in brightfield and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. In an effort to improve axial resolution in conventional widefield microscopy, we implemented dynamic optical projection tomography. To quantify variability when characterizing heart function, we developed in vivo high-throughput microscopy. Finally, we carried out joint and quantitative studies of heart morphogenesis and functiogenesis by use of a novel imaging technique, burst time-lapse microscopy (BTLM). This allowed building time-lapses revealing the morphogenesis of the highly dynamic cardiac valve leaflets as they progressively prevent retrograde flow between cardiac chambers. This work provides new insights into cardiogenesis and should allow better understanding of normal and diseased development. We anticipate that the developed tools will be applicable for imaging a wide range of dynamic biological samples.",,,
752,"Composition, Temperature, and Pressure Dependence of the Phonon (Thermal) Conductivity of Silicate Geoliquids","The study of geoliquids and their transport properties is a burgeoning field that sheds light on many critical geological problems. One such property, the thermal conductivity, measures the heat conduction capacity of a material and plays an important role in mantle and crust dynamics. Previous research has suggested that an increased insulation factor in rocks of the crust, regulated by relatively small values of the thermal conductivity, promotes anatexis and alleviates radiogenic heating requirements for the inducement of dehydration-triggered partial melting (Whittington et al., 2009). At greater depths, the proposed existence of melt patches along and immediately above the Core-Mantle Boundary (CMB) at ~2900 km depth could explain the discrete rather than graduated thermal gradient seen across the CMB (Murakami and Bass, 2011). This thesis describes the use of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to compute thermal conductivity for three liquid silicates: CaMgSi2O6, NaAlSi3 O8 and MgSi2O4. The motivation for this study was to examine the temperature, pressure and compositional dependencies of thermal conductivity approximating conditions in the upper mantle (0-30 GPa, 2000-4500 K) for a few end member geosilicate liquids of natural importance. Results at low pressure and temperature show good agreement with recent laboratory measurements on CaMgSi2O6 and NaAlSi3O8 suggesting that MD simulation can provide realistic values at elevated pressure and temperature, conditions not readily accessible without great expense and time in the laboratory. For example, simulation results for molten diopside at 1763+/-13 K and 0.36+/-0.017 GPa provide a thermal conductivity value of k=1.186+/-0.019 W/m K while laser-flash data from Hofmeister et al. (2009) provides a value of k=1.178 +/-0.06 W/m K, agreement to within a percent. Further, a positive correlation between atomic structure and thermal conductivity is confirmed. At low pressure, the polymeric liquid NaAlSi3O8, in which each oxygen atom is surrounded by two nearest neighbors of either Si or Al, is expected to possess a longer phonon mean free path, and thus higher conductivity, than the less polymerized liquid CaMgSi2O6, in which each oxygen atom, on average, is surrounded by only 4/3 nearest neighbors of Si. Simulation results for diopside melt at 2059+/-12 K and 0.04+/-0.14 GPa and albite melt at 2090+/-20 K and 0.20+/-0.23 GPa give values of k=1.143+/-0.004 W/m K and k=1.498+/-0.147 W/m K, respectively. Thus, this expectation based on empirical results has been faithfully captured by MD simulation. A modified Arrhenian expression was found to fit all liquids over the temperature and pressure range of the simulations (2000-4500 K and 0-30 GPa) reasonably well (correlation coefficient R2 &ap; 0.9). Activation energies are around 20 kJ/mol and activation volume is of order a few cm3/mol. A good correlation between the coordination numbers (CN) of Ca, Mg, Na, Al and Si around oxygen and by oxygen around the cations and thermal conductivity may be used semi-quantitatively to predict thermal conductivity in multi-component silicate liquids.",,,
753,"Separation, Denoising, and Reconstruction of 4D Embryonic Cardiac Microscopy Datasets for Improved Visualization and Flow Analysis","Cardiac development is a highly dynamic process since the heart is beating long before it has reached its final shape. Currently there is a need for novel image processing techniques for image component separation, denoising, and reconstruction of high frame-rate, high resolution, multi-dimensional cardiac datasets acquired during live (in-vivo) imaging of the embryonic heart. Such methods would help in quantifying blood flow and tissue deformation during cardiac development, thus facilitating a better understanding of the interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors that contribute to cardiac morphogenesis. The first part of this thesis deals with improving the specificity in label-free, high speed brightfield (BF) microscopy images. We propose a motion-based separation algorithm to decompose a single-channel 3D+time volume into three channels showing cyclic heart-wall, static support structures, and transient blood cells. The technique is based on non-uniform temporal synchronization, selection, and combination of images from multiple cardiac cycles and z-sections to produce 3D+time image volumes of one full cardiac cycle that are highly suitable for 3D visualization and analysis of the individual structures' dynamics in the embryonic heart. In the second part, we develop a computational noise reduction technique to enhance optical coherence tomography (OCT) datasets of cyclically moving structures. This allows imaging dynamic structures and fluid flow within scattering tissue like the embryonic mouse heart, while preserving temporal and spatial resolution. In the final part, we discuss reconstruction of a 3D+time cardiac volume from multiple high-speed 2D+time sequences that are sequentially acquired along multiple heart beats. Current methods overcome the limitation of low frame-rates in direct 3D+time imaging either by synchronizing the 2D+time sequences using complex triggering hardware during acquisition or by image-based retrospective temporal registration of the 2D+time sequences which accumulates registration errors. Our technique uses image-based retrospective gating for temporal alignment but mitigates the cumulative registration errors by using a second set of 2D+time sequences acquired at an angle orthogonal to the first. By globally minimizing an objective criterion that depends on the similarity between the data present at the intersecting slices, the two sets are registered and fused to obtain a high-speed high-resolution multi-dimensional reconstruction of the heart. The techniques presented in this thesis have been applied for reconstruction of high-speed (100-3000 frames per second), 3D+time cardiac datasets with micrometer resolution (0.8-4.0 mum) in live cardiac BF microscopy images of zebrafish embryos and cardiac OCT images of mouse and rat embryos. The tools developed improve the visualization of cardiac BF and OCT datasets over existing image processing techniques, and enable quantitative study of cardiac morphogenesis.",,,
754,Grammatical Sketch of Turkmen,"The aim of this thesis is to provide a linguistically-informed profile of the Turkmen language in its contemporary form. This work incorporates and builds upon the findings of previous grammars of the language, notably Clark (1998), but goes beyond these works in addressing clause-level processes and discourse phenomena in greater detail. Included are a brief sociohistorical introduction, description of the basic structural organization of the Turkmen language, and four glossed and translated texts.",,,
755,Distinctive and Efficient Local Features for Real-Time Mobile Applications,"Local features are widely used in many computer vision tasks such as marker-less augmented reality (AR), object recognition and tracking, and 3D reconstruction. The robustness, distinctiveness and high efficiency of a local feature are critical to the user experience of real-world applications. However, existing local feature algorithms are either too compute-insensitive to achieve real-time performance, especially when running on low power mobile devices, or not sufficiently robust and distinctive to identify correct matches from a large database. This thesis focuses on designing robust, distinctive and high-speed local features that can run in real-time on mobile devices such as smartphones. Typically, a local feature extraction pipeline includes two components: 1) interest point detector which identifies a set of salient points in an image, and 2) point descriptor which represents each detected point using a feature vector. For the interest point detection, this thesis focuses on accelerating SURF point detector by solving two mismatches between the SURF algorithm and the mobile hardware that cause substantial slow-down of the detection process: 1) mismatch between the data access pattern and the small cache size, and 2) mismatch between the huge amount of branches and high pipeline hazard penalty. To address the mismatches, two techniques: tiled SURF and gradient moment based orientation assignment are proposed. Tiled SURF improves data locality and greatly reduces memory traffic. To avoid the penalties caused by pipeline hazards, the original orientation operator is replaced with branching-free gradient moment computations. For the point description, this thesis presents a highly efficient and distinctive binary descriptor, called Local Difference Binary (LDB). LDB directly computes a binary string for an image patch using simple intensity and gradient difference tests on pairwise grid cells within the patch. A multiple gridding strategy is applied to capture the distinct patterns of the patch at different spatial granularities. To further enhance the distinctiveness of LDB, a learning-based framework is proposed. In the framework image pixels are densely sampled and represented using Harr-like features, providing a rich source of distinctive binary features. A modified AdaBoost algorithm is leveraged to automatically extract a small set of critical features for any given task with the goal of maximizing the Hamming distance between mismatches while minimizing it between matches. Extensive experiments on real data demonstrate that the proposed point detector and descriptors achieve high robustness, distinctiveness and efficiency on mobile devices.",,,
756,"The Effects of Party Identification on Attitudes toward Reproductive Rights, 1977-2010","In light of ongoing academic debates about U.S. ""culture wars,"" and the continued politicization of reproductive rights, I examine Republican-Democrat attitude divergence over reproductive rights among the general public. The attitude divergence over abortion that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, which is largely attributed to party ""sorting"" or realignment, has been well documented (Abramowitz and Saunders 1998, 2005, 2008; Adams 1997; DiMaggio, Evans, and Bryson 1996; Evans 2003; Fiorina, Abrams, and Pope 2011; Fischer and Mattson 2009; Wolbrecht 2000, 2002). However, less is known about the underlying causes of this realignment. While many scholars point to shifting party demographics and religious factors as causing the attitude realignment and divergence, the role of political party identification remains underappreciated. I address the following research questions: (1) what is the effect of political party identification on attitudes toward reproductive rights, net of religious and other factors, and how has it changed over time? (2) Does the effect of political party identification vary by gender? Using data from the 1972-2010 General Social Surveys, I find that partisan attitudes toward abortion, birth control for teens, and sex education share a very similar pattern of divergence among the public, and that political party identification largely increases in explanatory value in the 1990s and 2000s for all three of these variables even when accounting for religious and other demographic factors. Additionally, I find that female Democrats became increasingly liberal in their attitudes toward abortion at a faster rate than male Democrats. My conclusion discusses possible causes of the increasing effects of Republican and Democratic Party identification.",,,
757,Thermal Performance of III-Nitride Light Emitting Diodes and Developments in Laser Based White Lighting,"Light emitting diodes, LEDs, have two distinct reductions in their efficiency. Efficiency droop which is a decrease in efficiency with increasing current density, and thermal droop, a reduction in efficiency with increasing temperature. Although there has been extensive work on efficiency droop and research into both the mitigation and causes of efficiency droop, comparably little research has been done on thermal droop. Since the early years of III-Nitride LEDs, have shown better performance than other materials systems used in visible light emitters when operated at increased temperatures. Due to the push for increased electrical efficiency thermal droop has been largely ignored or dealt with at a packaging level. Now LEDs are increasingly used in general illumination applications requiring high-current and high-flux operation resulting in elevated operating temperatures. In such high power applications LEDs can reach temperatures of over 100 C where the performance can be significantly degraded. By altering the internal structure both below and within the active region the thermal droop of LEDs was reduced while preserving or enhancing electrical efficiency. Increased high temperature performance was observed on both blue c-plane and m-plane LEDs. Electrical droop which adversely affects LEDs in general illumination applications is difficult to mitigate. As an alternative to high-current, high-luminous flux LEDs for general illumination, phosphor converted laser, pc-LD, based white lighting is demonstrated. pc-LD shows virtually droop free performance over a wide range of high current densities with high luminous flux levels. The ability to achieve efficiencies on par with pc-LEDs, with significantly reduced substrate use and extremely high current operation, suggests that pc-LD white lighting has potential for entry into select white lighting applications in the near future. First demonstrations of pc-LD white lighting with general illumination level fluxes are shown, achieving efficacies of 80 lm/W and luminous fluxes of greater than 1 kLm.",,,
758,Re-architecting Internet Access and Wireless Networks for Rural Developing Regions,"In this work we focus on unique Internet connectivity challenges and opportunities in rural areas, especially in developing regions. Providing access in rural areas is particularly challenging due to its unique set of social and technical constraints. In order to quantify the challenges being faced by Internet users in rural areas, we conducted on-site and on-line interviews and analysed network traces from a rural network in Macha, Zambia. Our findings reveal severe local and global connectivity limitations that are unique to rural areas. Local wireless networks experience interference and packet loss due to poor network designs and limitations of WiFi in rural areas. Bandwidth-restricted Internet gateways are constantly congested during normal daytime usage periods. Users describe cost, limited availability and unreliability of Internet access as key barriers to on-line interaction. These obstacles prevent leisurely access to the Internet, including, amongst others, users generating and sharing media. This leads to a more transaction-like or ""deliberate interaction"" model for many rural users. Usage analysis reveals unique behaviour for users in rural areas. Most traffic is web-based traffic as opposed to peer-to-peer traffic in developed countries. Social media features even more prominently than in western countries, with Facebook being the most visited website; users are twice as likely to access Facebook than Google search. Further analysis of Facebook traffic shows a high degree of traffic between local users in the village. These unique patterns and constraints form the basis for ICT solutions we propose for rural regions. In order to avoid using congested rural Internet gateways, we propose a set of techniques to localize traffic. VillageShare, a Facebook-based localization application, facilitates file sharing amongst users in the village without the need to send media over the bandwidth-constrained gateway. VillageShare is also capable of time-shifting uploads to off-peak usage periods in order to avoid upload failures. In order to exploit locality of interest in mobile phone usage, we designed VillageCell, an open-source, low-cost pico-cell-like base station, that allows users to make free local cellular calls in a village. It takes advantage of the very high penetration rate of mobile phones in rural Africa, which occurs even though many villages lack cellular coverage. VillageCell is also able to support SMS to instant message client exchange as well as routing calls between VillageCell phones and phones on the public switched telephone network. The low population density and large village diameters in rural areas of Africa imply a need for novel solutions to spread wireless connectivity to individual homes. Current solutions, based on 802.11 require clear line-of-sight and have limited range. Those based on WiMax are not suitable due to high licence and deployment costs. We propose to use the recently freed TV spectrum bands known as ""white spaces"", encompassing frequencies from 52MHz to 698MHz, to cover vast distances in rural areas. Our solution, VillageLink, builds on the existing 802.22 white space standard to optimally utilize white space spectrum. We add a feature that allows base stations to allocate optimal channels using inter-cell probing across all available TV channels. Channel probing is critical as frequency selectivity is more dependent on antenna characteristics and non-linearity of RF components in the system than on the free-space propagation laws in the white space band. In order to evaluate our interventions, we deployed VillageShare and VillageCell in Macha, Zambia and evaluated VillageLink using simulations built on a real 3 km white space link in South Africa. We collected usage logs of these systems both through quantitative and qualitative studies. For qualitative studies we involved users in an iterative design process and made use of on-line interviews to understand user perception of our solutions. Ultimately, we hope that this research will lead to better penetration of wireless networks and improved network performance for users in rural villages, culminating in a more inclusive and representative Internet that truly reflects all languages and cultures in the world.

759,Making It New Again: Innovative Poetry and the Reinvention of Ireland at the Turn of the Twenty-First Century,"While criticism of contemporary Irish poetry has largely focused on the reverberations of the post-imperial sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland, I have turned instead to the engagement of Irish poets with the effects of neoliberalism and globalization on Ireland, with particular attention to the Soundeye poets, in order to understand Irish literature as it exists outside the British-Irish binary. The coterie of poets I study are termed the Soundeye poets after their regular attendance at the annual Cork-based Soundeye Poetry Festival; the poets are Billy Mills, Catherine Walsh, Maurice Scully, Randolph Healy, and Trevor Joyce, all of whom draw inspiration from the radical forces of international Modernism and the historical avant-garde in their formal choices and in their attempts to revamp poetry to reflect the globalized Ireland in which they live. In the last half of the twentieth century, the Republic of Ireland turned away from isolationist policies and an agrarian economy to embrace the European community and the global market, which led to the economic boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s termed the ""Celtic Tiger."" My dissertation argues that the Soundeye poets reveal and critique, not only in content, but also in poetic form, the societal consequences of privatization and basement-level corporate taxes. I conducted interviews in 2009 with the five poets above in order to more deeply understand their experience of the economic and cultural shifts in Ireland and the impetus behind their formal experiments.",,,
760,Putative Secrets and Turmoil in Romantic Relationships Over Time,"This dissertation examines how the unplanned discovery of secret information can impact turmoil (i.e., conflict, instability, and relational uncertainty) in romantic relationships and explores whether certain factors (i.e., reasons for the putative secret, use of deception, relationship satisfaction, forgiveness) moderate the effects of putative secrets on relationship turmoil over time. The sample consisted of 305 college students who were currently in dating relationships. The participants first reported on any putative secrets their partner was keeping or kept in the past and then completed three-week online diary entries where they tracked their satisfaction and perceptions of turmoil in their relationship. Several important findings emerged from the study. The results of this investigation indicate that individuals who were currently managing the discovery of a putative secret had more turmoil in their dating relationship over the three-week period than individuals who experienced a putative secret in the past or no putative secrets at all. Analyses also tested the moderating effect of the perceived reasons (i.e., pro-social or selfish) and strategies (i.e., overt deception) for concealing the secret on the relationship between putative secrets and turmoil. Overall, the results suggest that while the reasons for keeping the putative secrets are important, they are not nearly as important as the fact that the secret was kept in the first place. Two of the reasons, protecting the relationship and avoiding negative evaluation, significantly moderated the impact between putative secrets and conflict. Specifically, when individuals knew a current putative secret and were more likely to perceive that the reason for concealing the secret was to protect the relationship or so the secret keeper could avoid negative evaluation, they reported greater conflict during the three-week study. Avoiding negative evaluation and satisfaction also significantly moderated the association between putative secrets and self-uncertainty and putative secrets and relationship uncertainty. However, the remaining pro-social or selfish reasons did not significantly moderate the association between putative secrets and other types of turmoil such as instability and relational uncertainty. Similarly, overt deception did moderate the association between putative secrets and conflict, but not the associations between putative secrets and instability or relational uncertainty. Thus, the results of this study suggest the extent that knowing relational partners are deliberately concealing information impacts relational turmoil more than the perceived reasons and strategies for concealing the information. The results of this study allow several new contributions to be made to scholarship on secret keeping. First, given the inherent relational nature of secrecy, this study addresses the perspective of the individual from whom the secret is being kept. Most models of information regulation do not examine secret keeping from this perspective. Second, this dissertation also illuminates the importance of time with regard to the impact that putative secrets can have on romantic relationships. In general, the findings of this study suggest that individuals who currently know a putative secret their romantic partner is keeping experience increased levels of turmoil in the relationship over time compared to individuals who know a putative secret from the past. The results highlight that individuals seem to recover from the short-term impact (i.e., conflict, instability, and relational uncertainty) of the putative secrets over time. Third, the results suggest that while the perceived reasons for keeping the putative secrets are important, they are not nearly as important as the fact that the secret was kept in the first place. Finally, this dissertation acknowledges that other factors, including satisfaction and forgiveness, may expedite the rate at which relationships can recover from rule violations or relational transgressions such as putative secrets. Specifically, being satisfied with one's relationship and forgiving one's partner for the putative secret could mitigate some of the impact of putative secrets on romantic relationships. Together, these findings highlight the complex nature of putative secrets and the potential factors that can moderate the amount of turmoil individuals experience in their dating relationships over time as a result of those secrets.

762,"Writing Revelation: Mary Baker Eddy and Her Early Editions of ""Science and Health"", 1875--1891","Mary Baker Eddy's biography has been done in spades. As the American founder of a new church that had gone global by 1900, this is not unexpected. Yet unlike scholarship on its founder, scholarship on the Christian Science religion is slight. Historians of religions in America agree that Eddy's denomination has had an outsize influence on American culture and that her main book, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, has been widely read. However, in the past fifty years, only one book-length study has been published seeking to interpret the emergence and meaning of the Christian Science denomination in American cultural life. The present study of Science and Health steps into this gap, approaching the history of Christian Science through the lens of what Eddy termed her religion's ""textbook."" This study uses historical methods rooted in women's, American, religious, print, and book history. It is not essentially biographical, though it attends to how events in Eddy's life resulted in changes to her text and, conversely, how the attention, reception, and use her text received resulted in changes to her thought and life. Each edition of Eddy's book developed alongside its author, printers, publishers, and readers. Thus the evolving editions of Science and Health speak to the development of Christian Science as no other document or set of documents can. I argue that Eddy's Science and Health presents a new phase of American religiosity that resonates and converses with but does not fit within existing categories. Eddy presented her book not as a second, new, or supplemental Bible, but as a revealed work interpreting the principle or science behind the healing in the Bible, which she claimed would renew and extend apostolic life today. This claim emerged, expanded, and continues to operate among a variety of cultural materials and historical domains, which helps us capture her religion's identity more precisely than previously. I ultimately contend that in Christian Science, Eddy introduced a postwar, millennialist restorationism with a revelatory rationale that both intimately interacted with its historical setting and altered its cultural landscape with a new view of Christian healing.",,,
763,Holographic Applications for Black Holes and Condensed Matter,"This dissertation investigates extensions of AdS/CFT and its applications to black holes and condensed matter. We begin by introducing the AdS/CFT correspondence and the various numerical methods we employ. We then apply these methods to construct a 'black funnel'. These solutions are dual to a Hartle-Hawking state of a strongly coupled field theory on a black hole background. We then study the Lifshitz spacetime which is dual to a non-relativistic field theory with an anisotropic scaling symmetry. This spacetime has a curvature singularity due to diverging tidal forces. We examine the properties of a test string as it propagates in this background and find that the singularity causes the string to experience infinite mode production. We explore the effects of a confinement/deconfinement transition. In the Lifshitz spacetime, this additional ingredient makes the zero temperature limit singularity-free. We also add a confinement/deconfinement transition to the holographic superconductor and produce its phase diagram. This system has a rich phase structure with a conducting phase, an insulating phase, a confining superconductor, and a deconfined superconductor. Surprisingly, it also allows for a situation where a superconductor can transition to an insulator by lowering the temperature. We attempt to reproduce some known results in condensed matter from a holographic standpoint. We construct a holographic model of a Josephson junction and reproduce the familiar properties associated with it. We then study the effects of finite size on holographic superconductors and find a behaviour consistent with the known results of strongly coupled superconductors.",,,
765,InP HBT Power Amplifier MMICs toward 0.4W at 220GHz,"RF power amplification above 200GHz has become more critical as higher frequency bands are sought for radar and space applications. At 220GHz, a low-loss free-space propagation window is very alluring for potential systems, however, a single transistor cannot produce sufficient output power requisite for a wireless system. This work demonstrates solid-state power amplifier MMICs targeting up to 0.4W at 220GHz. Power amplifier cells are designed using four 6&mgr;m-long common emitter and common base InP HBTs to form a cascode. Single InP HBTs with 250nm-wide emitters and have shown a peak fMAX of 700GHz and peak fT of 400GHz. The cascode cell shows above 15dB of small signal available gain at 220GHz. Non-inverted microstrip IC interconnects shield the InP substrate and provide a low-loss environment for impedance tuning and power combining. Multiple levels of power combining are performed on wafer to reach a high overall saturated output power at 220GHz. Experiments were designed to find the limits of transistor density, the optimal Class A load line, the optimal number of power combining levels and gain stages, the maximum physical size, and the maximum possible DC power consumption at the IC level. In the first attempt, a 4-Cell SSPA was reported to have 48.8mW of saturated output power at 220GHz with a compressed gain of 4.5dB. On a second maskset, a 2-stage, 8-Cell SSPA had 90mW of saturated 220GHz output power at 8.2dB of compressedgain. A third set of designs demonstrates a 4x increase in output HBT periphery over the 8-Cell SSPAs in Tapeouts 1 and 2. In full-thickness RF power measurements, 180mW of saturated power was observed at 214GHz when air cooled. When heat removal by wafer thinning and mounting is complete, power levels may be close to the 400mW shown in simulation.",,,
766,"Understanding Multiple Bonding Interactions with Uranium and the Group 16 Elements (E = Oxygen, Sulfur, Selenium, Tellurium)","Uranium oxides are the most common form of uranium in both nuclear waste and in the environment. As such, the uranyl dioxo framework (UO2)2+, and its strong UO triple bond interactions, dominate the research. It is well-established the oxo ligands are thermodynamically robust and kinetically inert, thus making the uranyl fragment very unreactive. Interestingly, microbial activation of uranyl is a vital component in the sequestration of uranium in uranium-contaminated environments, likely requiring functionalization of the normally unreactive oxo ligands. However, there is little evidence available for the mechanism of this process and model systems describing this chemistry are scarce. In contrast to uranium oxide chemistry, the chemistry of uranium and the softer Group 16 elements (e.g., S, Se, Te) is substantially less developed even though it has been proposed that separation of radiotoxic fission products in spent nuclear fuel would be greatly enhanced by employment of soft-donor extractants. This postulation has been rationalized on the basis of increased covalency within actinide-chalcogenide bonds. As such, developing soft-donor, heteroatom-substituted analogues of the uranyl moiety will allow for greater insight into the extent of f-orbital participation, and thus, covalency, within uranium-ligand multiple-bonding frameworks and facilitate the design of novel waste extractants. This first part of this dissertation describes the activation of uranyl via reductive silylation. By employing strongly donating equatorial co-ligands, the nucleophilic nature of the oxo-ligands is exploited by addition of Me 3SiI. This substrate promotes reduction to U(V) and silylation of both oxo ligands. Subsequent addition of Lewis bases results in facile reduction to U(IV) and clearly displays the complete transformation of the uranyl fragment to better described 'alkoxide-like' complexes. The second part of the dissertation attempts to expand the library of uranium-chalcogenide complexes, targeting molecules which exhibit multiple-bonding ligation modes reminiscent of uranyl. In this regard, a highly reducing U(III) starting material was employed and found to readily activate chalcogen sources to yield several complexes which exhibit terminally-bound chalcogenide ligands. These complexes were fully characterized to better understand the electronic nature of the uranium chalcogenide bonds.",,,
767,Does Evidence Matter? How Middle School Students Make Decisions About Socioscientific Issues,"People worldwide are faced with making decisions daily. While many decisions are quick (e.g., what clothes to wear), others, such as those about environmental issues (e.g., overfishing), require more thought and have less immediate outcomes. How one makes such decisions depends on how one interprets, evaluates, and uses evidence. The central objective of this thesis was to investigate environmental science literacy in general, and specifically, to understand how evidence and other factors impact decision-making. I conducted three main studies: First, I provide an example of how decision-making practices affect environmental systems and services through a descriptive case study of Atlantic bluefin tuna overfishing. I reviewed the scientific, historical and cultural factors contributing to a paradox of marine preservation in the Mediterranean and highlighted the need for education and informed decision-making about such social and ecological issues. This study motivated me to investigate how people make decisions about environmental issues. Second, I interviewed middle school students to understand how they describe and evaluate evidence hypothetically and in practice about environmental issues---a key component of environmental literacy. Students discussed how they would evaluate evidence and then were then given a packet containing multiple excerpts of information from conflicting stakeholders about an environmental issue and asked how they would make voting or purchasing decisions about these issues. Findings showed that students' ideas about evaluating evidence (e.g., by scientific and non-scientific criteria) match their practices in part. This study was unique in that it investigated how students evaluate evidence that (1) contradicts other evidence and (2), conflicts with the student's prior positions. Finally, I investigated whether middle school students used evidence when making decisions about socioscientific issues. I hypothesized that holding a strong opinion would decrease the likelihood of changing decisions when presented with additional information. Findings indicated that most students do not change their stance after reading additional evidence. Students were more likely to change their decisions about issues that they cared least about than about issues that they cared most about. Implications for science teaching and learning are discussed.",,,
768,The Maximal Covering/Shortest Path Problem Revisited: An Examination and Reformulation of the Problem to Allow the Elimination or Attachment of Sub-Tours,"There are many problems that can be addressed as a spatial optimization problem, including location, districting, and routing. The problem addressed here is a routing problem that is inspired by transit system design. Transit systems in small to medium sized systems tend to utilize routes that involve loops. Routes in larger systems rarely have loops, other than the simple ones forced when travelling along parallel one-way streets. In larger cities, most routes can be considered as linear features. The literature on optimal routing design began with the work of Euler (1741) who defined the Euler Tour problem, which is commonly referred to as a postman problem. More recently, Dantzig et al.(1954) presented a formal mathematical model of the Travelling Salesman Problem and the Orden (1956) formulated the Shortest Path Problem as a mathematical programming problem. More recently, Current et al. (1984) formulated the shortest path covering problem. The shortest path covering problem represents the underlying design problem involved in transit system layout. This shortest path covering model and its variants optimize route coverage and route efficiency (as measured by route time or distance). Geographers and operations researchers have used the optimal covering-path model (Current et al. 1984 & 1985) in a number of ways to design systems of efficient transit routes. In fact, all optimal design problem formulations are based upon the original, classic work of Current. Past research has built upon the ground-breaking work of Current et al (1984 & 1985) almost without question. This thesis revisits this classic research within the context of transit route design. It is demonstrated that the classic models are built with an implicit assumption that optimal routes will not contain loops. It is also shown that the proposed algorithmic solution approach of Current et al. (1984 & 1985) prevents the occurrence of most loops in a solution. It is shown that loops may indeed be part of an optimal route and that the original models and solution approach are therefore flawed. This is, in itself, a substantial finding. A new model formulation is proposed for the maximal covering/shortest route problem which allows loops to be utilized in a solution, which would otherwise be excluded. In addition, a revised solution procedure is presented which allows loops to form whenever embedded loops are optimal. This new model, as well as the original models, are applied to a hypothetical network derived from the classic Swain dataset. The optimal tradeoff curve between route coverage and route distance is generated for vi both the classic model as well as the new, revised model. Solutions that contain loops are identified which are superior to what is generated by the original models. This thesis has called into question the very underpinnings of a classic design problem and has shown that the original assumptions about embedded loops are wrong and that the classic model formulations and solution process are flawed. The work describe here will have a significant impact on future model development for cover-path problems and applications.",,,
769,Acoustic and Phonological Correlates of Korean Perception of Japanese Alveolar Fricatives,"Patterns in orthographic representation of loanwords have often been used to infer information about phonological categories of the source and recipient languages. However perception studies have shown that loanword data can obscure patterns in perceptual mapping, e.g. Schmidt (1996). Korean exhibits a relatively unique phonemic contrast based on laryngeal activity, commonly referred to as tense /s*/ and lax /s/ or fortis and non-fortis /s/. This study investigates cross-lingustic perceptual mapping for Japanese single and geminate /s/ to the Korean lax /s/ and tense /s*/, and compares the results to predictions made by Japanese-to-Korean loanword research (Ito et al. (2006). A perception study was conducted using 32 bi-syllabic test tokens containing either Japanese single /s/ or geminate /ss/, and 32 bi-syllabic filler tokens, spoken in a carrier phrase by a 20-year-old native speaker of Tokyo Japanese. All tokens were presented twice in random order so that consistency of judgments could be analyzed. Twenty-two Korean native speakers participated in the experiment. Participants listened to stimuli over headphones and selected one of two orthographic representations for each stimuli, which for test stimuli differed only in whether they contained the character representing lax /s/ or tense /s*/. A linear mixed-effects model was used to evaluate thirteen acoustic and six phonological factors as predictors of response choice. The results contradicted some of the patterns observed by Ito et al. (2006), and in general found that Japanese phonological categories were less effective predictors than acoustic measurements. Additionally, many stimuli were found to have fairly high percentages of inconsistent responses. The results are taken to support a view that Korean native speaker mapping of Japanese fricatives is based on gradient perceptual similarity to native categories. An alternative description of the processes involved in cross-linguistic adaptation is proposed that references associative learning of acoustic correlates of speech perception and gradient activation of sound representations.",,,
770,"Search for supersymmetry in proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV in events with a single lepton, b-tagged jets and missing transverse momentum at the LHC using data collected from the CMS detector","This thesis describes a search for supersymmetry (SUSY) at the Large Hadron Collider using data collected in Run 2011 at center of mass energy of 7 TeV by the Compact Muon Solenoid detector with an integrated luminosity of 4.98 fb-1. First, the Large Hadron Collider is briefly described along with the Compact Muon Solenoid detector. Second, the Standard Model of particle physics is described which leads to the motivations for supersymmetry and its description. Finally, a search for supersymmetry in events with a single lepton, 2 b-tagged jets and missing transverse energy is documented in detail. The results are used to predict the yields from the standard model in bins missing transverse energy ( / ET ) and total transverse hadronic energy (HT). Limits are set using these results using a minimal supergravity SUSY model and simplified model spectra SUSY model.",,,
771,Micromechanical Modeling of Storage Particles in Lithium Ion Batteries,"The effect of stress on storage particles within a lithium ion battery, while acknowledged, is not understood very well. In this work three non-dimensional parameters were identified which govern the stress response within a spherical storage particle. These parameters are developed using material properties such as the diffusion coefficient, particle radius, partial molar volume and Young's modulus. Stress maps are then generated for various values of these parameters for fixed rates of insertion, applying boundary conditions similar to those found in a battery. Stress and concentration profiles for various values of these parameters show the coupling between stress and concentration is magnified depending on the values of the parameters. These maps can be used for different materials, depending on the value of the dimensionless parameters. The value of maximum stress generated is calculated for extraction as well as insertion of lithium into the particle. The model was then used to study to ellipsoidal particles in order to ascertain the effect of geometry on the maximum stress within the particle. By performing a parameter study, we can identify those materials for which particular aspect ratios of ellipsoids are more beneficial, in terms of reducing stress. We find that the stress peaks at certain aspect ratios, mostly at 2 and 1/ 2 . A parameter study was also performed on cubic particle. The values of maximum stresses for both insertion and extraction of lithium were plotted as contour plots. It was seen that the material parameters influenced the location of the maximum stress, with the maximum stress occurring either at the center of the edge between two faces or the point at the center of a face. Newer materials such as silicon are being touted as new lithium storage materials for batteries due to their higher capacity. Their tendency to rapidly loose capacity in a short period of time has led to a variety designs such are the use of carbon nanotubes or the use of coatings in order to mitigate the large expansion and stresses, which leads to spalling off of the material. We therefore extended the results for spherical storage particles to include the presence of an additional layer of material surrounding the storage particle. We perform a parameter study to see at which material properties are most beneficial in reducing stresses within the particle, and the results were tabulated. It was seen that thicker layers can lead to mitigation in the value of maximum stresses. A simple fracture analysis was carried out and the material parameters which would most likely cause crack growth to occur were identified. Finally an integrated 2-D model of a lithium ion battery was developed to study the mechanical stress in storage particles as a function of material properties. The effect of morphology on the stress and lithium concentration is studied for the case of extraction of lithium in terms of the previously developed non-dimensional parameters. Both, particles functioning in isolation were studied, as well as in closely-packed systems. The results show that the particle distance from the separator, in combination with the material properties of the particle, is critical in predicting the stress generated within the particle.",,,
772,"The Role of Social Networks in Marine Conservation: A Case Study of Providencia and Santa Catalina, Colombia","While there is growing evidence of the importance of effective marine conservation programs that address both ecological and social concerns, there is still a dearth of evidence concerning the social mechanisms that can promote or hinder such programs. Some studies have correctly suggested that there is a need to increase attention to the social component of marine protected areas (MPA), yet few have developed a systematic way to analyze and determine particular characteristics that influence an individual's decision whether to accept or reject conservation. To provide a way forward, I present findings from research conducted on the Caribbean islands of Providencia and Santa Catalina, Colombia, where I used a political ecology framework to examine environmental problems and institutions both at a macro and micro level, and social network analysis and regression analysis to determine the rationale on which individuals base their decisions regarding marine conservation programs. In particular, because MPAs most often are located in close proximity to coastal areas where fishing is a way of life, I focus attention on artisanal fishermen's livelihood approach and their social networks to identify critical interpersonal relationships and individual attributes that affect their position vis-a-vis conservation. Findings show that complex environmental policies create distrust within artisanal fishing communities and that trust in government institutions is one of the variables that most affects fishermen's acceptance of resource management programs. Findings also indicate that knowledge of declining marine resources does not necessarily increase fishermen's willingness to conserve. Social conditions, including lack of alternatives and the need to meet day-to-day necessities, often influence an individual's decisions, despite their understanding of possible long-term consequences of their actions. In addition, findings show that while social networks are critical for information sharing, building and maintaining important interpersonal relationships, and in influencing an individual's decision to accept or reject management programs, networks alone do not determine their attitudes or actions; a number of variables working in tandem dictate their behavior and willingness to cooperate. The social, political, and ecological complexities of marine resource management addressed here stress the importance of supporting robust social science research on the effects of conservation programs. This dissertation also emphasizes that both the social and natural sciences can contribute a wealth of knowledge about the interface between the human and natural dimensions of conservation, and that they can collectively produce management strategies that both support healthy ecosystems and sustainable livelihoods. Therefore, I present a comprehensive way to understand local communities and the possible outcomes of MPA designation, and provide a direction for future social science research on marine conservation.",,,
773,"Children at the Edge of the Empire: A History of Childhood in Coastal California's Pueblos and Missions, 1750 -- 1848","Colonial California has drawn the attention of professional and amateur historians since the late nineteenth century. The focus has largely been on missions and presidios, and to a lesser extent, the civilian settlements and ranchos. These have primarily been studies of men and/or native peoples, although recently scholars have begun to focus on the experiences of women, adding much to our understanding of the period. This project builds from and augments these earlier works by analyzing the lives of children in order to provide a new window into the complex colonial world of California. Native and Hispanic children were dramatically impacted by the process of Spanish settlement and colonial authorities often emphasized the important role that they would play in this process. The concept of childhood infused the language of colonization in California and a clearer understanding of the ways that priests and secular authorities used it allows us to obtain a firmer grasp of the dynamic between Native Americans and these newcomers. The lives of native and Hispanic children reveal the role that children played in the creation of the Spanish empire in California as well as the establishment of a Hispanic culture. Throughout this study children emerge as colonizers, colonized individuals, members of families, conveyors of culture, laborers, students, and converts. The various roles they fulfilled demonstrate their importance to the colonial project as a whole. Parents and leaders within Hispanic and native communities recognized the importance of raising children in the appropriate way, so that their vision for California would either be preserved or come to fruition. The lives of children from the pre-mission period through the end of the Mexican period provide a way to reconsider oft told stories from California's past in an effort to obtain a richer and more nuanced understanding of the way colonialism worked on the far reaches of the Spanish empire and the Mexican Republic.",,,
774,An Applied Test of the Social Learning Theory of Deviance to College Alcohol Use in the Context of a Community Enforcement Campaign,"Akers's Social Learning Theory of Deviance was tested in the context of an enforcement-based public health campaign aimed at decreasing access to alcohol. In sociology and criminology journals, the theoretical implications of using increased enforcement as a deterrent for dangerous drinking are being investigated in the lab and with secondary data analysis, though not in the context of a purposeful enforcement campaign. In communication journals, alcohol campaigns are frequently assessed, but enforcement interventions have been evaluated exclusively atheoretically. As a result, there is no work investigating both the internal and external validity of using any deterrence-based theory as the basis of an alcohol intervention. The current study begins to fill this gap in the literature by testing a criminology theory with cross-sectional data collected during an enforcement-based alcohol campaign. 347 randomly selected students from a large southern California university participated in study. Several hypotheses derived from the criminological theory were tested and confirmed, providing support for using the Social Learning Theory of Deviance as the explanation for how criminal deterrence functions as an alcohol use behavior change tactic. As predicted by the theory, the impact of ethnicity on alcohol use was completely mediated by differential association and differential reinforcement. Both alcohol-related reinforcements and punishments were associated with higher levels of alcohol use, but in support for the theory, higher net positive reinforcements to costs for alcohol use predicted more general use, more underage use, and more frequent binge drinking. An unexpected finding was the negative relationship between negative expectations and negative experiences. Further context and evidence is provided by delving into the particular campaigns currently running at the test site, and the implications for future campaigns based on Akers's deterrence theory are discussed.",,,
775,Advances in audio coding and networking by effective exploitation of long term correlations,"This dissertation focuses on tackling challenges related to efficient transmission of all varieties of audio signals over networks, which mainly are, compression at delay constraints acceptable for communication applications, and dealing with loss of content due to noisy channels. Efficiently exploiting long term correlations is key to address these challenges. For audio compression, while there are many well known techniques that are effective in exploiting redundancies within a frame, the only solution known for inter-frame redundancy removal is the naive technique of using a simple long term prediction (LTP) filter, which provides a segment of previously reconstructed samples as prediction for the current frame. Although this technique can at least be effective for audio signals with a single stationary periodic component (i.e., monophonic), the typically employed parameter selection based on minimizing the mean squared error as opposed to the perceptual distortion criteria of audio coding, hinders the performance of LTP. This drawback is first addressed by employing a novel two-stage parameter estimation technique which jointly optimizes LTP parameters along with quantization and coding parameters, while explicitly accounting for the perceptual distortion and rate tradeoffs. However, since most audio signals are polyphonic in nature, containing a mixture of several periodic components, the LTP tool due to its simplistic structure is well known to be ineffective. This major drawback is addressed by employing a sophisticated filter structure of cascading multiple LTP filters, each corresponding to individual periodic component. Also a recursive ""divide and conquer"" technique is introduced to estimate parameters of all the LTP filters in the cascade. Effectiveness of cascaded LTP for compression is demonstrated in two distinct settings of the ultra low delay Bluetooth Subband Codec and the MPEG Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) standard. In MPEG AAC, we specifically adapt the cascaded LTP parameter estimation to take into account the perceptual distortion criteria, and also propose a low decoder complexity variant. Another shortcoming of the LTP tool used in audio coders is its subpar performance for speech and vocal content, which is well known to be quasi-periodic and involve small variations in pitch period. This drawback is addressed by employing a novel technique of introducing a single parameter of 'geometric' warping in the LTP filter, whereby past periodicity is geometrically warped to provide an adjusted prediction for the current samples. Again the parameter estimation for this modified LTP filter is adapted to take the perceptual distortion criteria into account. Objective and subjective results for all the settings validate the effectiveness of the proposals on a variety of audio signals. For dealing with loss of content due to noisy channels, concealment techniques based on LTP filtering are well known and are suitable for audio signals with single periodic component. However, none of the existing techniques are designed to overcome the main challenge due to the polyphonic nature of most music signals. This shortcoming is addressed by employing the cascaded LTP filtering to effectively estimate every periodic component from all the available information. Objective and subjective evaluation results for the proposed approach, in comparison with existing techniques, all incorporated within an MPEG AAC low delay decoder, provide strong evidence for considerable gains across a variety of polyphonic signals.",,,
776,Targeting Question-Asking Initiations through Video-Feedback to Improve Social Conversation in College Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders,"Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) display a marked impairment in social interaction and often exhibit difficulty in maintaining social conversations with peers. These deficiencies can manifest in low levels of question-asking initiations and pragmatics in social conversation that persist throughout the developmental lifespan. Most of the research in this area has focused on children and adolescents with ASD, yet there is an increasing need to evaluate supports for a growing college population with ASD. Failure to address these social deficits can damage long-term outcomes for individuals with ASD. Given the long-term connection between social skills and positive outcomes, future research supporting social conversation development in the college population with ASD is warranted. Social initiation, specifically question-asking, has been shown to be a pivotal behavior that can lead to collateral gains in other, untargeted behaviors and promote a more positive developmental trajectory for children. However, research is still needed assessing the immediate collateral effects of targeting question-asking initiations in adults. Video-modeling interventions have been increasingly evaluated and shown to be an effective technique in teaching social behaviors with children with ASD, yet there is an increasing need to evaluate these interventions with adolescents and adults with ASD. The purpose of this study is to assess whether or not young adults with ASD can increase their use of question-asking initiations in social conversation and measure possible immediate collateral gains in targeting the pivotal area of question-asking initiations in young adults with ASD. Using a multiple-baseline across-participants research design, this study examines whether video feedback is successful in teaching question-asking initiations in social conversation for each of 3 college student participants with ASD and whether there are collateral gains in other conversational behaviors. The results indicate that the use of video feedback to target question-asking initiations led to (a) increases in the frequency of question-asking, (b) improvements in the participants' ability to maintain fluid conversation (i.e. absence of long, awkward pauses), (c) maintained interest and affect in the conversation, (d) improvements in overall ratings of pragmatics, (e) a decrease in perseveration during conversation, (f) an increase in the participants' perceived confidence in maintaining social conversation, and (g) generalized gains to peer conversational partners not involved in the intervention and typical, non-clinic, environments.",,,
778,"And the Wound Speaks: Language, Trauma, Topography and Uncreation","This project constitutes a sustained attempt to investigate the correlation between testimony and landscape. My inquiry focuses on post-World War II fiction that engages the catastrophe of Shoah in terms of a corporeal and topographical remnant. As such, it aims to engage the effaced originary event as it emerges in the post-memory narrative. The imaginative reconstruction by the second- generation witness is driven by the need to know the spatial and temporal enclosure of trauma. Landscape and topography figure prominently in my research, because post-memory looks for traces, demands a narrative map. In each of these texts, translation is a rebirth mechanism, and in each case, when translation fails and the semiotic process breaks down, the body becomes event---testimony becomes corporeal. This project also examines the way post-war authors have internalized the redrawn boundaries of nations, fleshing out the narratives only the traces of which remain. The texts of this genre attempt to speak the horrors aloud, not only to speak the horror on the behalf of the witnesses, but also to situate themselves in the event they were powerless to effect. The nature of witness testimony as translation becomes most evident when the novel itself undergoes the process of translation from one language into another. My dissertation engages the mimesis of narrative translation and the act of second-generation testimony, demonstrating that translation and topography function as active modes of memory. I elaborate on my theoretical position in detail in Chapter 1, before pursuing a close reading of Victor Koz'ko's Trial in Sloboda , Primo Levi's short story ""The Servant,"" Elie Wiesel's The Golem: the Story of a Legend As Told by Elie Wiesel , Bernard Otterman's Golem of Auschwitz and finally, Jonathan Safran Foer's Everything is Illuminated.",,,
779,Synthesis and Reactivity of Cationic Metal Nitrosyl Complexes of Nickel and Copper,"The synthesis and characterization of a {CuNO}10 complex namely, [Cu(NO)(CH3NO2)5][PF6] 2 has been achieved by addition of two equiv of [NO][PF6] to a suspension of copper powder in nitromethane. In the solid-state, this complex features a bent Cu--N--O moiety [121.0(3)o] and a long Cu-N bond distance. The electronic description of these compound is best described as a Cu(II) center interacting with an NO radical ligand. However, this complex readily reacts with methylated benzenes to form [arene, NO][PF6] and [Cu(arene)2][PF6]. The nickel nitrosyl complex namely, [Ni(NO)(CH3NO2) 3][PF6] is synthesized by treatment of nickel powder in nitromethane with [NO][PF6] in the presence of NiI2 catalyst. This complex has an Enemark-Feltham configuration of {NiNO}10. It exhibits a tetrahedral geometry about the Ni center with a linear Ni--N--O bond angle [174.1(8)o]. The nitromethane ligands are readily substituted with a number of different donor ligands, such as acetonitrile, mesitylene, and 2,2-bipyridine (bipy). Addition of bipy to [Ni(NO)(bipy)][PF6] results in formation of a rare five-coordinate nickel nitrosyl complex [Ni(NO)(bipy)2][PF 6]. This complex exhibits a bent reduced NO- ligand in the solid state. On standing in dichloromethane solution N2O is evolved. Conversely, on standing in acetonitrile the NO coupled product (bipy)Ni(kappa 2-O2N2) precipitates from solution. Addition of acetylacetone to [Ni(NO)(bipy)2][PF6] yields clean formation of [Ni(acac)(bipy)2][PF6], N2O and H2O. The reaction mechanism of NO reduction was studied by performing a number of control studies. The complex [Ni(NO)(bipy)(Me2phen)][PF6], which contains sterically bulky methyl groups, does not yield N2O over 24 hours, supporting a bimetallic coupling pathway. In contrast, addition of 1 equiv of NO gas to [Ni(NO)(bipy)(Me2phen)][PF6] results in the isolation of the NO disproportionation product. Reaction of [Ni(NO)(bipy)][PF6] with AgPF6 or [NO][PF6] in MeCN, in the presence of 2 equiv bipy, results in formation of [Ni(bipy) 3][PF6]2 and release of NO gas in moderate yields. Addition of the inner sphere oxidant Ph2S2 does not yield denitrosylation, but the diphenyldisulfide adduct [{(bipy)(NO)Ni} 2(&mgr;-S2Ph2)][PF6]2 is formed in good yield. However, tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) does result in cleavage of the Ni--NO bond and generation of NO gas. The metal containing product is [(bipy)Ni(&eegr;2-TEMPO)][PF6]. Finally, pyridine-N-oxide forms the adduct complex, [Ni(NO)(bipy)(ONC5H 5)][PF6].",,,
780,Spatial Stochastic Simulation of Biochemical Systems,"Recent advances in biology have shown that proteins and genes often interact probabilistically. The resulting effects that arise from these stochastic dynamics differ significantly than traditional deterministic formulations, and have biologically significant ramifications. This has led to the development of computational models of the discrete stochastic biochemical pathways found in living organisms. These include spatial stochastic models, where the physical extent of the domain plays an important role; analogous to traditional partial differential equations. Simulation of spatial stochastic models is a computationally intensive task. We have developed a new algorithm, the Diffusive Finite State Projection (DFSP) method for the efficient and accurate simulation of stochastic spatially inhomogeneous biochemical systems. DFSP makes use of a novel formulation of Finite State Projection (FSP) to simulate diffusion, while reactions are handled by the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA). Further, we adapt DFSP to three dimensional, unstructured, tetrahedral meshes in inclusion in the mature and widely usable systems biology modeling software URDME, enabling simulation of the complex geometries found in biological systems. Additionally, we extend DFSP with adaptive error control and a highly efficient parallel implementation for the graphics processing units (GPU). In an effort to understand biological processes that exhibit stochastic dynamics, we have developed a spatial stochastic model of cellular polarization. Specifically we investigate the ability of yeast cells to sense a spatial gradient of mating pheromone and respond by forming a projection in the direction of the mating partner. Our results demonstrates that higher levels of stochastic noise results in increased robustness, giving support to a cellular model where noise and spatial heterogeneity combine to achieve robust biological function. This also highlights the importance of spatial stochastic modeling to reproduce experimental observations.",,,
781,Pathogenic Activation of STAT3 in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease,"Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is an inherited disease induced by loss of both functional copies of either Polycystin-1 or Polycystin-2. Pathogenic symptoms of the disease become apparent in mid-life. As the disease progresses normal renal tubule tissue is progressively replaced by fluid-filled epithelial- lined cysts. This corresponds with a decline in kidney filtration function, eventually leading to kidney failure, which is addressed by either kidney transplant or lifelong dialysis. While these treatments are expensive they are the only options currently available to prevent ADPKD from being a fatal disease. To counter these grim prospects, my dissertation research has focused on the molecular mechanisms responsible for ADPKD disease development. We report that the transcription factor STAT3 is a significant player in ADPKD. While Polycystin-1 activates STAT3 transcription, a novel disease associated PC1 cleavage event (P15) prevents this from occurring in ADPKD. Alternatively, the disease-associated PC1-P30 cleavage product co-activates and enhances STAT3 transcription. Surprisingly, we also report significantly elevated levels of SOCS3 in ADPKD. SOCS3 inhibits JAK2-dependent STAT3 activity, indicating that the aberrantly activated STAT3 associated with ADPKD is from a JAK-independent source. Indeed, we report the novel finding that the Vasopressin 2 receptor activates Src and its ability to transcriptionally activate STAT3. This occurs in a cAMP-dependent and JAK-independent manner, and this is further enhanced by PC1-P30. This is the first report of a contiguous, plasma membrane to nucleus signaling pathway implicated in ADPKD.",,,

In this work, we present an experimental study in flat nanochannels on the effects of ionic strength on ss (single stranded) and ds (double stranded) DNA electrophoretic separations, towards optimizing resolution and accuracy of this technique. While the origin of nanoscale electrophoretic separations is not fully understood, it is clear that hybridization and separation behavior of DNA is influenced by a number of parameters including: buffer ionic strength, channel size, strand length, and strand conformation. By conducting a systematic set of experiments, we expose their relative importance and contribution, and propose an explanation of the origin of the observed behavior.",,,
783,"On Taxes, TFP, and Computation","This dissertation consists of three separate papers in macroeconomics. The first chapter deals with role of institutions in explaining cross-country productivity differences. I pick one measure of weak contract enforceability for which we have reliable micro-measurements, the recovery rate, and show that differences in the recovery rate take us far in explaining cross-country productivity differences. I calibrate the model to U.S. data, and feed observed recovery rates across countries. I find that the ensuing misallocation of talent generates aggregate TFP differences of 1.5, about a fourth of observed TFP differences. I also find that complementarities between contract enforceability and aggregate endowments are quantitatively important. In the second chapter, joint work with Marek Kapicka, we show that human capital accumulation decisions have important implications for the design of tax systems. We show that the no distortion at the top result from the Mirrleesean literature may not apply if discouraging labor supply increases incentives to invest in human capital. We show that, under certain conditions, the inverse of the intratemporal wedge follows a random walk. This result is, to our knowledge, novel. We calibrate a two period economy and find several notable results. First, to elicit learning effort, it is efficient to make the consumption process risky for high ability agents while insuring low ability agents. Second, high ability agents face the largest expected increase in the intratemporal wedge. Third, high ability agents face higher intertemporal wedge. Those normative prescriptions differ significantly from the existing literature that abstracts from human capital. We also find large welfare gains for the U.S. from switching to an optimal tax system. In the third chapter, joint work with Kyle Klein, we propose a method to implement a workhorse optimization algorithm, the Nelder-Mead Simplex Method, in parallel using a distributed memory implementation. The simplex' vertices are equally distributed among processors at each iteration. Each processor then updates its worst local vertices, communicates the results, and a new simplex is formed with the vertices from all processors. In simulations, our implementation exhibits large speedups and is scalable to large problem sizes.",,,
784,On Display: American Photography at Three Nineteenth-Century World's Fairs,"This study examines the uses, classifications, and reception of American photography at three World's Fairs. The three expositions chosen for this analysis represent distinct discourses that characterize nineteenth-century America: at the Crystal Palace of 1851, a rising abolitionist voice as America's unseen slave population was increasing, at the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, an obsession with order and clarity following the chaos of the Civil War, and at Chicago's Columbian Exposition of 1893, the emergence of commerce as an American standard. Together, the treatment of photography at these expositions helped to give shape to issues of nationalism and power. However, this assimilation often resulted in a complicated environment of resistance and ambiguity, which in turn, was mapped onto the photographic field. Ultimately, this study demonstrates the way in which photography's uses at the fairs have formed our current complex understanding of the medium.",,,
785,Mixture Tests with contributions to the analysis of times between events in a limit order book,"A plethora of high frequency data is available to study from major electronic trading systems. Here we study the market microstructure through the dynamics of a limit order book (LOB). For a LOB, it is common to model waiting times until certain events occur. We have NASDAQ OMS data, which motivates us to study the behavior of times in between events instead. Patterns observed in the data suggest an invisible switch, which controls the change in speed of limit order executions. This leads to testing the number of different speeds of executions. In particular, do the times between events follow a mixture of distributions or not? This is the Mixture Test. It is a LRT test, however it has some idiosyncrasies. Since Hartigan (1985aa) we know that the conventional asymptotic theory has difficulties when the parameter is on the boundary of the parameter space and an issue of nonidentifiability of parameters under the null hypothesis. The former is addressed by considering the sign of the mixing probabilities. The latter is solved by deriving the limiting distribution of the LRT for a fixed but unknown value of the unidentifiable parameter. Cho and White (2007) show that the resulting LRT statistic follows a Gaussian process with a specific covariance structure. We derive and simulate the covariance structure of a limiting distribution of LRT statistic for exponential family distributions. We propose to simulate an approximated Gaussian process using the finite number of principal components of a covariance matrix. From this we obtain the asymptotic critical values for a bounded parameter space. Details of an EM algorithm for estimating the parameters are outlined. The methods above are applied to conduct the Mixture Test for the LOB data. The first passage time of a BM process follows the Inverse Gaussian distribution. This makes an intuitive choice to describe the time interval between two limit order executions. These results provide significant evidence in favor of a two component Inverse Gaussian mixture model. In conclusion, we develop a collection of the methods to obtain asymptotic critical values and provide a practitioner with a tool to conduct Mixture Tests.",,,
786,Exploring the Effect of Video Game Playing on Static and Dynamic Spatial Cognition Skills,"This dissertation explores the relationship between video game playing and performance on static and dynamic spatial tasks focusing on Tetris and first person shooter games (FPS) like Unreal Tournament 2004. An extensive meta-analysis of previous game research found that Tetris had the strongest effect for mental rotation of 2D Tetris-like shapes (d = 0.82) and while FPS games were most effective on visual attention tasks (d = 1.13). Experiment 1 explores the relationship between 4 spatial skills and game performance in non-video game players. The study found significant correlations between Unreal Tournament 2004 performance and performance on all of the spatial tasks, while Tetris performance was only correlated with two of the tasks measures. Experiment 2 examined performance differences between action video game players (VGPs) and non-video game players (NVGPs) on the 4 spatial tasks as well as exploring processing differences on a 2D mental rotation task during an electroencephalography (EEG) session. VGPs only significantly outperformed NVGPs on the interception task (p < .001, d =.92), which has task demands very similar to the game mechanics for an FPS game. For the 2D rotation task differences, the ERP waveforms showed a flatter profile for the 150 degree angle trials for VGPs compared to the NVGPs who showed the typical negative modulation around the P300 suggesting that VGPs might have used an alternative strategy for larger rotation angles. Experiment 3 examined the cognitive consequences of 10 hours of training with either Unreal Tournament 2004 (UT) or Tetris. Training with UT was not effective at improving performance on any of the spatial cognition tasks above the retest gains experienced by the control condition. The Tetris training group showed significant improvement on both response times for mental rotation ( p = .05) and interception task performance (p = .05). Comparisons of the ERP recordings on the 2D rotation task between control and UT trainees showed no significant differences. Therefore, training with an FPS game did not affect how the spatial information was processed. Overall, the results from the meta-analysis and Experiments 2 and 3 argue for specific transfer theory when training spatial skills.",,,
787,"Paradox of Elitism: Vision, Risk, and Diplomacy in the European Career of Colonel John Trumbull (1756-1843)","Paradox of Elitism: Vision, Risk, and Diplomacy in the European Career of Colonel John Trumbull (1756-1843) reconsiders Trumbull's life and works within the context of the eighteenth-century Federalist political ethos, American foreign policy, and nationalist trends of the Neoclassical academic style through the War of 1812. Articulating Trumbull as a Smithian ""economic man"" through five chapters, this study explores his artistic practice as the foundation and formulation, but also the failure, of a conservative Federalist aesthetic that was usurped when a more radical Democratic-Republicanism became the dominant cultural discourse in the first decades of the nineteenth century. Deeply faithful to Alexander Hamilton, Trumbull saw himself fulfilling the proper role of the public American artist, embracing the so-called 'invisible hand' of the market to facilitate his vision. Trumbull, like the Federalists, faded into unpopularity in the first decades of the nineteenth century, but given his prominence in the Federalist community, he, much more than the decidedly neutral Gilbert Stuart, ought to be credited as the inventor of Federalist vision---the politically-infused synthetic Neoclassicism that expressed the fair rule of the executive few over the following many. The dissertation's first two chapters reassess Trumbull's early life through his service in the Continental Army, and to his mysterious first trip to Europe, on which he took part in a secret plot with Benjamin Franklin, entered artistic study in London with Benjamin West, was arrested on suspicion of espionage, imprisoned, and eventually granted freedom. The third and fourth chapters follow Trumbull through the most imaginative and productive phase of his career, between 1784 and 1789, and explore the ways in which Trumbull merged the nationalizing styles of academic Neoclassicism in Great Britain and France, with continually evolving academic theories of art and his own rational, commercial view of the world that reduced the idea of history to variables of risk and profit. The product was Trumbull's own synthetic modes of historical painting and portraiture. The final chapter of this work examines the ways in which Trumbull, in his dual roles as an American diplomat and a picture-dealer in Europe in the 1790s, attempted to integrate risk management, United States foreign policy, and connoisseurship into his Federalist political enterprise.",,,
788,"Improving the Hydro-stratigraphic Model of the Oxnard Forebay, Ventura County, California, using Transient Electromagnetic Surveying","To characterize the hydro-stratigraphy of an area, drilling and well logs provide high resolution electrical resistivity data, albeit for limited areas (points). The expense of drilling indirectly leads to sparse data and it is necessary to assume lateral homogeneity between wells when creating stratigraphic maps. Unfortunately, this assumption may not apply to areas in complex depositional and tectonically active settings. The goal of this study is to fill in data gaps between wells in a groundwater basin in order to better characterize the hydro-stratigraphy under existing and potential sites for managed aquifer recharge. Basins in the southern California study area have been used for decades to recharge surface water to an upper aquifer system; this work also addresses whether the local hydro-stratigraphy favors surface infiltration as a means to recharge water to the lower aquifer system. Here, soundings of transient electromagnetism (TEM), a surface geophysical method, are correlated with nearby down-hole resistivity and lithology well logs for grain size interpretations of the subsurface in unsaturated conditions. Grain size is used as a proxy for permeability (hydraulic conductivity), with resistivity contrasts highlighting variations in the media, which would affect groundwater flow in both vertical and horizontal directions. Results suggest a nearly horizontal, extensive, low permeability layer exists in the area and only a few noted locations are favorable for surface -to-lower aquifer system recharge. Furthermore, zones of higher permeability deeper than the upper aquifer system are discontinuous and isolated among lower permeability zones. However, the TEM profiles show areas where lower permeability zones are thin, and where alternatives to surface percolation methods could be explored. In addition, the survey adds information about the transition between the upper and lower aquifer systems, and adds detail to the topography of the base of freshwater. Finally, this work effectively decreases the interpolation distance between data points of wellbores, and when viewed in sequence the TEM profiles present a 3D depiction of basin hydro-stratigraphy.",,,
789,Ultimate and Ontogenetic Origins of Human Vocal Sexual Dimorphism,"Human voices are sexually dimorphic in at least three ways: males have lower fundamental frequency, lower and more closely spaced formant structure, and less fundamental frequency variation. The overarching goal of the present research is to understand the ultimate and ontogenetic origins of human vocal dimorphism using the theory of sexual selection. Outstanding questions can be organized into three general lines of inquiry: 1) Have male voices been subject to both intra- and intersexual selection? Or has one process dominated? 2) What does a masculine voice signal? That is, why would potential mates and competitors attend to vocal characteristics? 3) What constraints ensure that vocal signals remain honest, or at least honest enough to warrant attention? Part A (Articles 1 and 2) targets question 1 by examining reactions to masculine voice features among college-aged men and women. Part B (Articles 3 through 6) primarily targets questions 2 and 3 by studying individual differences in vocal maturation among Bolivian adolescents. Results include several important findings. US college-age men's mating success (Article 2) was better predicted by a strong correlate of vocal dominance (F 0 variation; Article 1) than by a strong correlate of vocal attractiveness (mean F0; Article 1), suggesting that intrasexual selection may have been an important selection pressure on the evolution of men's vocal traits, and may be more important in that regard than female choice. Listeners may attend to vocal frequencies because they signal honest, non-redundant information about male strength that cannot be ascertained from visual inspection of body size (i.e., height or adiposity; Article 4). Tsimane males experience later voice change and have higher adult voices compared with North Americans (Article 3), suggesting that a higher-pitched voice reveals a developmental history of energetic constraints. Not only is testosterone strongly related to development of fundamental and formant frequencies, but it mediates the relationship between energetic condition and vocal characteristics (Article 5). These findings provide evidence for a costly signaling model of masculine voices; males in better condition have greater resources to invest in testosterone-dependent traits like the voice.",,,
790,Determinants of folding rates of cooperative biopolymers,"With the overarching goal of improving our understanding of the kinetic mechanisms by which biomolecules fold, I have here investigated 1) an unusual, and 2) an unprecedented folding reaction, the first being the anomalously accelerated folding of a small, single-domain protein, and the second being the two-state folding of a small, single-domain DNA. The folding rates of simple, single-domain proteins are relatively insensitive to the finest details of sequence. This said, the R48F substation in chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) is the single most accelerating substitution seen in a set of over 700 mutations in 24 single-domain proteins for which kinetic data are available. Specifically, this mutation accelerates the folding of CI2 40-fold, an acceleration that dwarfs the less than 4-fold average change in rate produced by the point substitutions in my data set. To understand the origins of this anomalous acceleration I synthesized and characterized 10 additional substitutions at this same site, and correlated charge and hydrophobicity of the substitutions to folding rate. In doing so I find that the observed acceleration arises due to two effects that independently stabilize the folding transition state of this protein: alleviation of repulsive charge-charge interactions arising due to the wild-type arginine's positively charged guanidinyl group, and the increased hydrophobicity associated with its replacement with side chains more hydrophobic than the arginine's three methylene units. Of note, a possible reason for preservation of this biophysically unfavorable wild type arginine is a functional constraint; that is, faster folding substitutions such as isoleucine seem to pay a cost in enzymatic activity in the native role of protease inhibition. In parallel studies I explored more generally the characteristics governing folding of sequence-specific heteropolymers. To do so, I characterized the two-state folding kinetics of a small DNA aptamer and, in an effort to determine which aspects of two-state heteropolymer folding are ""universal,"" compared these to the folding of a collection of similarly simple, two-state proteins. Specifically, I investigated three kinetic properties commonly measured in proteins for this novel two-state aptamer---folding rate, beta Tanford (betaT), and &phiv; values---and found substantial similarities and differences between the aptamer and a typical protein of the same size and complexity. First, in a model that predicts the folding rate of proteins based solely on topology, the observed folding rate of the aptamer appears to obey this same relationship. Second, the urea-derived beta T, which is thought to reflect the fraction of hydrophobic surface area buried in the transition state, falls slightly on the low end of the range seen for a set of 38 similarly small, single domain proteins. The salt-derived betaI, which is thought to reflect the fraction of ionic interactions formed in the native state, is, in contrast, significantly higher, suggesting that the fraction of native ionic interactions formed in the transition state is higher than hydrophobic ones. Finally, of three sites for which &phiv;---a residue-specific analog of betaT, indicating fraction of native-like character around an amino acid, or in this case, nucleobase, in the transition state---could be calculated, two are >0.75 while the third, despite a large error, falls unambiguously above 0.5. That three out of three &phiv; values are above 0.5 suggests perhaps a more native-like transition state than is typical of proteins, which average _0.3. It thus appears that 1) the large role chain entropy plays in determining folding rates of proteins may apply to the folding of cooperative heteropolymers more generally, 2) ionic interactions may be slightly better consolidated in the folding transition states of oligonucleotides, which are highly charged, than are hydrophobic interactions, and 3) the transition state for two-state oligonucleotides may be more native-like than is typical for similarly simple, two-state proteins.",,,
791,"Unsettling Solidarities: Asian North American and Indigenous Literary Contacts, Post-1968","Unsettling Solidarities examines Asian North American and Indigenous solidarities, alliances, and interactions imagined in the contemporary literatures of these two communities, tracing how these moments of literary contact reveal the vexed dynamics of race and resistance after the mid-twentieth century. Emerging out of anti-colonial and anti-racist movements of the 1950-70s, narratives by Maxine Hong Kingston, Joy Kogawa, Karen Tei Yamashita, and Leslie Marmon Silko grapple with the limits of identity-based cultural politics, articulating in its their place different collectivities and ethical relations that can account for the increasing stratifications of power within and across racial identities. The dissertation tracks the aesthetically diverse ways these writers imagine their own and each other's communities within their revised cultural politics, and argues that the ambivalent depictions register these communities' differential yet mutually constitutive histories and critical visions for social justice. Recent scholarship in Critical Race and Ethnic Studies has posited a comparative framework---within and between communities of difference---for apprehending the shifting localities, agents, and processes of settler colonial distributions of life and (vulnerabilities to) death. Such analytics have become urgent within the context of (neo)liberal multiculturalism and its selective recognition of cultural difference as the condition of possibility for new global economic restructuring for inequities. Asian/Indigenous convergences, in particular, bring to the fore how civil rights frameworks can elide Indigenous experiences, perpetuating discursive erasures of settler colonial conditions. The dissertation's project foregrounds these tensions, attending to their biopolitical and affective dimensions, as they are revealed, negotiated, and metonymically reproduced within the narratives. By investigating the intersecting affective economies of Asian/Indigenous interaction, imagined at various geopolitical sites (such as Hawai`i, the U.S./Mexico Border, Canada, and Brazil), this study connects intimate and localized specificities of racial formations to broader networks of settler national configurations.",,,
792,"Labeling Large Scale Image Datasets: Exploring Priors, Semantics and Scalability","Recent advances in high throughput imaging have led to the creation of massive image repositories, where human analysis is often infeasible. Automated image analysis offers a promising alternative for reducing analysis time by several orders of magnitude. In order to design algorithms that are robust and practically usable, there are a variety of design considerations that require investigation. This dissertation explores three specific considerations in visual segmentation and detection, namely domain specific priors, scalability, and semantics inherent in the data. The first part of this work proposes a framework that adapts a generic segmentation/tracing technique to application specific ones using priors such as topological dynamics and shape in a Markov Random Field (MRF) setting. Subsequently, techniques to scale algorithms for tracing a large number of targets are explored. These tracing algorithms are based on graph diffusion, and are capable of scaling gracefully with increasing number of targets. The final part of this work explores semantic attributes that humans utilize for object detection in weakly supervised settings. Kernel methods are utilized to learn classifiers in multiple feature spaces proposed in this work for detecting non-rigid objects. This work adopts the problem of connectomics (neuronal circuit reconstruction from Electron Micrographs) to illustrate the applicability of proposed techniques. Specifically, the segmentation and tracing algorithms are shown to isolate neuronal structures in 3D while the detection algorithms localize synaptic junctions, thus taking a step closer to automated neural circuit constructions from raw image data. Further, the proposed algorithms are also applied on natural image and video data to illustrate their generalization capability.",,,
794,Coming Out of the Locker Room: Lesbian and Bisexual Collegiate Basketball Players' Experiences and Perceptions of Safe Space Climate in College Athletics,"In the world of athletics, a hetero-masculine culture rules, and for many lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) athletes this can be a challenging environment. Focusing on the experiences of lesbian and bisexual college basketball players, it is the aim of this dissertation to investigate the current safe space climate for LGBT student athletes. A safe space climate can be defined as an environment where leaders and teammates are allies that are well educated on resources for LGBT issues and are welcoming to an open expression of one's sexuality. Using a mixed method approach and branching survey, data is collected to understand what the current climate in college athletics is towards LGBT student athletes. The first of the two surveys used was The LGBT Athletics Climate Survey, consisting of fifty questions and open-ended comments section. The second survey used is the commonly used Attitudes Towards Lesbians and Gays Scale (ATLG-S). Participants were directed to the first survey if they selected that they were LGBT in the demographic section. If participants selected heterosexual or straight in the demographic section they were directed to complete the ATLG-S. Findings show that athletic leaders and coaches need to learn to incorporate practices such as placing safe space stickers in offices to help create a safe space culture. There are also findings that more safe space practices must take place as lesbian and bisexual college basketball players experience fear of coming out and are dealing with rejection from their family. Currently, it is shown that most lesbian and bisexual college basketball players are experiencing a conditionally tolerant environment that incorporates a ""glass closet"" mentality where sexual orientation is fairly supported, but encouraged to stay invisible. Future research on the role of the coaches and implications are discussed to help facilitate this change.",,,
795,Prosody and Grammar in Kabardian,"This study provides a systematic phonetic analysis of the basic entities of Kabardian prosodic units above the word and investigates the predictability of prosodic units from grammatical and discourse factors. This dissertation is the first extensive description of Kabardian prosody and grammar based on natural data. This study proposes that Kabardian prosodic units of various sizes are hierarchically arranged with the syllable being the smallest constituent followed in order of increasing size by the prosodic word, the intonation unit and the prosodic sentence. The salient morphosyntactic correlate of the two largest units is the distinction between finite and non-finite verbs. The best predictor of acoustic markers of prosodic boundaries proved to be the tripartite distinction between finite verbs, non-finite verbs, and all other morphological words. Argument structure (i.e. S and P) does not adequately predict prosodic unit boundaries. Morphology, which serves primarily to subdivide the POS category of non-verb words ('Others'), is not a good predictor of the measured phonetic properties. The Syntax parameter, which primarily replaced non-verbs and prosodic words with phrases and lexical words, failed to distinguish between phrase boundaries and phrase internal word boundaries.",,,
796,Human motivated multicamera video analytics,"The continued emergence of inexpensive sensors and storage has made the collection and processing of large quantities of visual data practical, opening up new possibilities in data exploitation and understanding. The volume of data also makes it increasingly difficult to rely solely on humans for review, requiring assistance from automated systems to use large data sources to their full potential. However, while large data has also enabled new algorithmic techniques, computer performance still lags behind that of humans. The work in this thesis addresses both sides of this problem by exploring both how automated systems can make the most of large data and how they can be refined to act more human when doing so. I will discuss video summarization as applied to a network of 11 cameras and show how our system makes the network data more accessible to human operators while also using human feedback to guide its design. A novel approach to object tracking that uses large-scale human annotation to implicitly apply human scene understanding in an automated system will also be discussed. Finally, I will present recent work in using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore how quantitative human feedback can be directly collected from a subject and applied to debugging traditional computer vision algorithms to bring them closer to human capabilities.",,,
798,Bridging Dimensions in Visualization,"Scientific and Information Visualization have evolved into two sub disciplines of visualization that are quite distinct from each other. A separation between these fields was justified because of significant differences in the types of data sets --- spatial versus and non-spatial --- and corresponding problems tackled by each. This separation led to a gap between the software tools, hardware technologies and visual languages adopted. However, available graphics and visualization techniques, regardless of their intended purpose, can be applied advantageously to both types of data sets. In this context, 3D graphics rendering methods, which are readily adopted for Scientific Visualizations, can be used to enhance 2D Information Visualization techniques. Similarly, certain spatial data sets can be better visualized with 2D Information Visualization approaches to support a range of tasks such as comparison and detection of patterns. The goal of this thesis is to develop Scientific and Information Visualizations with the following motivations: 1) dimensionality of a representation should be defined and addressed not as a binary distinction between 2D and 3D, but rather as a continuum such that visualizations can have intermediary dimensionality, 2) dimensionality of a visual representation should be determined by the task at hand rather than the spatial properties of the data or the conventions of the respective visualization fields. This thesis will present evidence from case studies that support the aforementioned propositions. It will discuss two case studies --- Stereoscopic Highlighting and Contour Maps --- that illustrate how 3D elements can be used to enhance 2D visualizations of non-spatial data. The benefits of less dimensional representations will be explored via LineSets and Weighted Graph Comparisons for Brain Connectivity Analysis case studies. Our results show that more compact representations can be realized and key tasks such as visual comparisons can be carried out more effectively with less dimensional visual representations of spatial data.",,,
799,Protein Site-Specific Hydration Dynamics Mediate the Early Aggregation Processes of Tau Proteins,"Identifying and characterizing the early oligomeric species of tau proteins is the key to understanding the mechanism of protein aggregation and, eventually, guiding the possible therapeutic intervention in their pathologic effects. The experimental studies of these transient and dynamic oligomeric intermediates have been difficult with existing experimental tools, and the mechanistic details about the aggregation process and tau self-assembly are currently not well understood. We utilize the combination of the Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (ODNP), NMR and Electron Spin Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, in combination with the protein site directed mutagenesis and spin-labeling approach to identify and characterize the different aggregation species of tau187 peptide (residues 255--441 of human tau) and to study the aggregation mechanism in solution, at ambient conditions. Our experimental approach employs the Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (ODNP) to investigate the translational dynamics of hydration water, at relevant time-scales (_ 10-1000 ps.), near (_ 5A) the spin-labeled protein surface. This is possible by measuring the ODNP Enhancement of the 1H of liquid water, diffusing near the paramagnetic spin-label, and extracting the dynamic information from the measured ODNP factors by considering the relevant spectral density function. We present our experimental findings, where tau187 monomers, upon incubation with heparin, suddenly self-assemble and populate the heterogeneous oligomeric species, where the overall increasing structural order and conformational rearrangements of tau187 continue throughout extended period of time, prior to the elongation of the fibrils. We also carried out EPR experimental analysis, where the inter-mixtures of the paramagnetic with diamagnetic labeled tau187 species allowed us to study the organization of peptide regions into parallel beta-sheets during fibril formation. This methodology has also enabled us to study the oligomer dynamics and sub-unit exchange in different aggregation species of tau187 and to provide experimental insight into elongation process of tau fibrils via annealing of highly ordered tau187 oligomers. Overall we successfully showcased our novel experimental approach for characterization of the early protein aggregation events.",,,
800,A Multiscale Study of Water via the Relative Entropy,"Water, perhaps humanity's most notable liquid, plays a key role in a myriad of physical mechanisms. For example, it is commonly known that the unique medium makes oily droplets aggregate with each other (i.e., oil does not mix with water). Nevertheless, the peculiarities of such a rudimentary process have been a contentious issue for decades: computational predictions propose a weak oscillatory force, yet experimental measurements suggest a strong monotonic force. In this work, I offer a resolution for this discrepancy by invoking an informatic property termed the relative entropy. In particular, I develop a comprehensive framework via the relative entropy for modeling purposes, and I in turn show that the apparent discrepancy is in fact a multiscale phenomena: oily droplets tend to aggregate via a weak oscillatory force if they are small and via a strong monotonic force if they are large, with the crossover occurring on the order of a nanometer. As the water-driven aggregation of oil is inherently linked with biological assembly, this dissertation has significant ramifications in various pharmaceutical and medical applications.",,,
801,Integrated CMOS Controller For Fast Optical Switching,"The growth in data centers traffic today is demanding more energy efficient way of computing and moving data across servers. Recent advances in silicon photonics open up exciting opportunities to solve the bandwidth limitation both on-chip and off-chip wire interconnects. On-chip photonic interconnects have been proposed to link multi-core systems to create a single logical compute node with terascale processing capability in an energy efficient manner. Within the data center, packet switching network is the preferred way of connecting compute servers because of low latency and high network utilization. Optical packet switching becomes an attractive solution as the demand for bandwidth increases. Traditional electronic network switches approach the power consumption limits as data-rates continue to scale higher. While optoelectronic and MEMS optical network switches can be large with hundreds of ports, but they are too slow for packet switching. Furthermore, the high costs and power consumption are barriers to mass commercialization. The key to overcoming this barrier is to integrate both active and passive photonic devices with CMOS and take advantage of the economy of scale of mature silicon manufacturing processes and thus lowering the cost while simultaneously enhancing the reliability of optoelectronic systems. In this work a fully integrated controller is designed and implemented in a 0.13mum CMOS process. The controller consists of a 2-Channel optical packet header receiver that integrates a novel burst-mode truly differential transimpedance amplifier, limiting amplifier and a burst-mode gated-oscillator based clock and data recovery circuit on the same chip, which also includes an on-chip phased-locked loop to generate the data clock, resulting in an ultra-fast lock time of 13ns, at low power consumption of 43.6mW per channel at 2.5Gbps operation. Second, the design of a low-power, area efficient and adjustable output optical switch fabric driver is presented. The driver enables 3.8ns of switching time when driving a 2x2 optical switch while consuming 150 muW of static power and occupies 0.01mm2 of silicon space. Finally, the design of an automatic power control loop that enables optical gain of up to 12dB is presented. The ability to compensate for optical losses enables the construction of large port count switches that are necessary for data center applications. Optical switching is just one example of electronic-photonic integration. The integration approach can be applied to optical transceivers, optical interconnection of multi-core processors on a supercomputer chip, and many telecom/data-com applications, including Fiber-to-the-Home transceivers, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplex (DWDM) transceivers, and optical Reconfigurable Optical Add-drop Multiplexers (ROADMs).",,,
802,Investigation of Indium Gallium Nitride Grown via Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition in Various Crystallographic Orientations for Solar Cell Applications,"Solar cell technology has long relied upon Si and GaAs based materials. While this industry is mature, it has approached a plateau in the push to increase efficiency. It has been proposed that the InGaN ternary materials system is ideal for this purpose. In this work we report on the growth, fabrication and testing of photovoltaic properties of InGaN based solar cells grown via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). In order for solar cells to work effectively, a minimum active region thickness is necessary for sufficient absorption of photons for conversion. At low In content compositions, high quality material has been grown and a simple p-i-n type solar cell with a single absorbing layer can be produced. However, at high In content compositions critical thickness limits for the thin films are well below the thickness requirements for full absorption. High In compositions are necessary to efficiently match the solar spectrum when designing multijunction solar cells. Solar cells require a thickness of 100-200 nm for sufficient absorption. Growth optimization and results for p-i-n type: single double heterostructures, multiple double heterostructure (MDH), and MQW, solar cells will be reported for InGaN grown on sapphire in the +c [0001] orientation as well as InGaN grown on bulk m-plane (10-10) substrates. Non-polar oriented growth of InGaN was investigated since as In content increases in typical c-plane growth, the polarization fields in the double heterostructure design of the p-i-n solar cell oppose the built in field of the junction and could potentially hinder carrier collection. At low In content, m-plane InGaN solar cells outperform c-plane solar cells with the same composition due to the higher quality material grown homoepitaxially on bulk GaN substrates.",,,
803,The Form and Function of Bar-Built Coastal Lagoons,"Bar-built coastal lagoons are common coastal landforms that typically occupy drowned river valleys and exist in wave-dominated areas characterized by seasonal rainfall. Wave-driven sedimentation often seasonally closes the inlet, forming a perched estuary that is separated from the ocean by a sand or gravel beach barrier. The pressure on these systems and their ability to provide important ecosystem services will increase in the 21st century due to climate change, sea-level rise, and continued population growth within their watersheds and estuarine margins. To better understand how coastal lagoons function, this work addressed three main topics: 1) the observed variable patterns of breaching and closure, 2) the beach-barrier groundwater connection, and 3) the role of watershed variability in estuary geomorphology. A hydrologic and geomorphic model of estuary breaching and closure was developed, assessed, and then used to examine how estuarine and beach processes affect the breaching and closure processes. The model is based upon the continuity equation for the estuary water balance, and a geomorphic component for the inlet that incorporates inlet sedimentation by waves and erosion by fluvial processes. The root mean square error of the predicted versus observed estuary stage was 0.45m, 0.39m, and 0.42m for three separate years when the inlet drained directly across the berm, and the model was able to reproduce the initial seasonal breaching, seasonal closure, intermittent closures and breaches, and the low-streamflow (closed state) estuary hydrology of the Carmel Lagoon, located in Central California. Model results show that estuary function (eg amount of time inlet is closed, low-flow hydrology, frequency of breaching) is sensitive to realistic variations in beach berm characteristics (hydraulic conductivity, height, etc.), estuary storage, and especially hydrologic inflow. Sea-level rise will potentially cause the estuary to behave more like a coastal lake. Groundwater and estuarine waterlevel observations indicate that the beach barrier aquifer provides a dynamic hydrologic connection between the ocean and the closed lagoon. Groundwater flow is predominantly oceanward for the conditions observed, and the flux is modulated by tides at all estuary waterlevels, reversing directions only during wave overtopping events that fully saturate the beach. A numerical model of barrier groundwater was calibrated with constrained input parameters and assessed using observed groundwater heads. The model accounts for berm morphology, swash infiltration, wave set-up, and a sloping no-flow bottom boundary. The model accurately reproduces observed groundwater fluctuations (RMSE is 0.062m, 0.074m, 0.022m for three wells), except during wave overtopping events, and model results indicate that the seepage flux (and its variance), groundwater heads, and width of the seepage face are all underpredicted when the topography of the berm is not incorporated into the model. Sensitivity analyses emphasize the importance of wave swash on model performance. Nineteen small, shallow lagoons in a tectonically active, low-wave energy region were mapped and analyzed to determine how watershed processes shape estuary geomorphology. Multiple linear regression analyses indicate that variability in lagoon area, length, volume, average width, circularity, and lagoon width expansion are primarily the result of variability in watershed precipitation and channel slope upstream of the lagoons. The coefficients of determination for the power function regressions are 0.88 (lagoon area), 0.88 (lagoon length), 0.83 (lagoon volume), and 0.74 (average width).",,,
804,High Temperature Effects on Algae Production for Biofuel: Numerical Simulation and Growth Experiments,"Growing algae in large ponds as a feedstock for biofuel has been of interest for some time, and has received considerable funding since the late 1970's. Desert regions enjoy certain advantages as algae-growing areas, abundant solar energy and inexpensive land among them. Nevertheless, one issue that has not been investigated sufficiently is the effect of high temperatures like those seen in the desert (>25 C), would have on algal growth rates. The desert's high temperatures could decrease these growth rates, and while there are different methods for cooling the ponds, they all increase the cost of growing algae. This may lead to situations where the cost of reducing growing pond temperatures might outweigh the gains achieved by increases in production. This thesis addresses this issue. To quantify the interplay between temperature and algae productivity, the effect that temperature has on algae productivity must be determined, as must the cost to maintain a pond at optimal algae-growing temperatures. This thesis uses experimentation to determine the temperature dependence of algae productivity, and determines the heat transfer requirements of pond cooling through numerical simulation.",,,
805,A Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Surface Tethered Biopolymers,"Theory suggests that biomolecules interact with surfaces via excluded volume effects, electrostatic effects and the formation of specific chemical interactions. In large part to the near complete lack of tractable experimental systems, however, these theoretical predictions have seen little experimental investigation to date. In response, the focus of this dissertation is three fold: 1) the development of such an experimental system, 2) its use to characterize the extent to which surface-biopolymer and inter-biopolymer interactions modulate the folding free energy of a surface-tethered biopolymer, and 3) the development of predictive models of these effects. To these ends, I have developed an electrochemical method by which to determine the folding free energy of a simple, DNA-stem-loop structure site-specifically attached by one end to a self-assembled monolayer deposited on a macroscopic gold surface. Using this system I have characterized the folding free energy of the stem loop as functions of the charge on the surface and the density with which the biopolymers are packed onto it. I find that, at high ionic strength and low surface charge, the surface-tethered biopolymer is more stable than the same molecule in free solution. This effect is reversed, however, by either increasing the surface charge or decreasing ionic strength. Motivated by these experimental observations I have developed a theoretical model capturing the thermodynamic effects of surface attachment. This model considers the electrostatic interactions between the biopolymer the surface and the entropic cost associated with the excluded volume effect. In the dilute, low packing density regime (i.e., where inter-polymer interactions are negligible), this model quantitatively recapitulates my experimental results without any open parameters. At high packing densities, however, inter-polymer interactions become significant and my experimental results begin to deviate significantly from the theoretical predictions. Existing polyelectrolyte brush theories, however, are at least qualitatively consistent with these results.",,,
806,The Generosity and Forbearance of the Bodhisattva: A Study of Three Heian Period Japanese Tales,"This thesis presents translations and analyses of three related Japanese Buddhist tales from the late Heian (794-1185) period. These tales are found in two collections of didactic ""explanatory tales&129;"" entitled, Sanbo ekotoba [special characters omitted], ""Illustrations of the Three Jewel"", and Homotsushu [special characters omitted] ""Collection of Treasures&129;"". These three tales show remarkable thematic and narrative debt to a canonical Chinese Buddhist scripture entitled Liu du ji jing and furthermore, each of these tales have their origins in two well known Indian tales of great antiquity, a Buddhist ""birth tale&129;"", the Vessantara Jataka and the beloved Hindu epic, Ramayana. The Japanese tales present themselves as tales of the historical Buddha&129;'s previous lives as a Bodhisattva in pursuit of the six perfections, yet also contain echoes of an early Indic socio-religious context in which renunciant sramana criticized and rejected aspects of orthodox Brahmanical religion pertaining to socially stratified caste, sacrifice and notions of duty, despite their having been no analogous religious history in Japan. These tales are a remarkable example of the way in which Buddhist literature preserved and transmitted elements of Indic culture that were absorbed and integrated with specific regional sensibilities as authentic expressions of a monolithic Buddhist tradition.",,,
807,Becoming SomeBody: Motivations for Changing Sex Characteristics and Transpeople's Understandings of Their Behaviors in Social Context,"This study examines the process by which people assigned unambiguously female at birth come to understand and identify a need for medical technological modification of sex characteristics as part of their identity. Theorizing about the concepts of sex, sex category, and gender utilizes the experiences of transpeople to critique reified notions of binary systems of sex, sex category, and gender. The theoretical deconstruction of these concepts, however, neglects the very real experiences of a self that is bodied---that bodies may be interpreted/experienced as more than simply a sexed/gendered body. Using semi-structured interviews, this study finds that individuals emphasize internal motivations and external validation for medical modifications. Results also show frequent non-binary identification of gender after modifications with attention to social context including the sex of the body of reference, geographical location, and age. This study questions the utility of an over-arching concept of gender identity that conflates (sex) body preferences with (gender) behavioral preferences as well as the categories woman and man that help to support this conflation.",,,
808,Defining parents' behavioral involvement in children's education: A similar phenomenon for English- and Spanish-speaking parents?,"The current study examined the cross-linguistic validity of an established parent involvement measure (developed by Walker et al., 2005). This measure was chosen because it is brief and based upon a popular parent involvement theoretical framework (Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler, 1995; 1997), specifically measuring home- and school-based involvement. The parent involvement survey was translated into Spanish and completed by 585 parents, of which 215 were English-speaking and 370 were Spanish-speaking. Two separate confirmatory factor analyses and a measurement invariance test were conducted to determine if the measure could be appropriately used with Spanish-speaking parents. Then, mean differences between the two groups were examined on every item of the survey to determine, which group demonstrated higher levels of involvement on each measured behavior. Additionally, the home- and school-based involvement subfactors were examined within a structural equation modeling framework to investigate the relation with the psychological beliefs of parental self-efficacy and role construction. Results from the CFA indicated that the parent involvement measure demonstrated excellent model fit for both groups. The subsequent measurement invariance test revealed that the scale functioned differently across English- and Spanish-speaking parents. The tests of item mean differences indicated that English-speaking parents showed higher levels of involvement in the areas of practicing skills at home and helping at school; however, Spanish-speaking parents reported higher levels of involvement at open houses and PTA meetings. Finally, it was found that parental self-efficacy significantly predicted home-based involvement for English-speaking parents, and school-based involvement for Spanish-speaking parents. Role construction significantly predicted levels of home-based involvement for Spanish-speaking parents as well. Implications and recommendations for future research are discussed in the final chapter.",,,
809,"Diversification, Systemic Default and Regulation","In the first part of the dissertation, we investigate the relationship between assets diversification and the probability of systemic default under Merton default models and first passage times models. Our study is based on continuous time log-normal models, which complements the works available in the literature most of which are based on one period discrete time models with assets following normal or uniform distributions. We find that a bank's degree of diversification may be higher than which is optimal for the stability of financial system, which motivate the need for diversification regulation. In the second part of the dissertation, we study how banks respond to changing regulations. We propose a dynamic model with bank's asset and short term funding driven by Brownian motions. Under our model, the regulator impose capital requirement, liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding requirement and the bank optimises its decisions to maximize equity holder's return subject to regulatory requirements. We discuss the cases where the bank behaves as expected by the regulators and cases where the regulations cannot achieve the goals as planned.",,,
810,Como es duro es bonito Labor Conditions and Gendered Complexities for Women Working on a Fairtrade Rose Farm in Ecuador,"This study explores women's work in Ecuador in rose production. The cut-flower industry has always been notorious for exploiting its predominantly female labor force and the environment (Korovkin 2003; Korovkin and Sanmiguel-Valderrama 2007; Rodriguez and Silva 1988; Talcott 2004). However, some farms like Fairtrade-certified Nevado Roses, in southern Ecuador, pride themselves on their ethical and fair policies towards workers. My research fills a gap in the literature by contributing an ethnographic account of worker perspectives on Fairtrade rose production. I address the following questions: Who are the women working in Fairtrade flowers and what do they think about their jobs? How does women's work in flowers affect their efforts to manage daily life and the future? How are the experiences of workers in a Fairtrade flower farm different from reported experiences on uncertified farms or farms with other certifications? Following over fifty in-depth interviews, I show that Nevado women have better working conditions than workers on uncertified farms and more opportunity for participation in workplace policy than workers on farms with other ethical certification. Most said they enjoy their jobs. Yet the gendered challenges of balancing home and work highlight the inadequacy of employer and social support for reproductive labor, specifically childcare. In line with Bhavnani, Foran and Kurian (2003), I argue that women must be centered in all development of global society, and that masculinist conceptions of work do not offer women a chance to improve their whole lives.",,,
811,"A Case Study of an Intensive Retention Program for At-Risk, First-Generation, First-Year University Students","Research on persistence in higher education identifies the importance of social and academic integration, involvement, and engagement and highlights the importance of the student's beginning years at a college or university in developing institutional commitment. This commitment increases student integration and therefore persistence. First-generation and low-income students face more challenges than traditional students as they enter and persist through college. This case study examines the impact of a retention program designed to increase student social and academic engagement and lessen financial barriers that may pose significant challenges for historically non-traditional students. The program supports 57 low-income and first-generation first-year students who received failing grades their first semester at the University. The program provided specialized opportunities for participants and allowed students to participate in a textbook rental program to lessen out-of-pocket expenses. Students' program participation, courses, and grades were tracked throughout the year. Interviews consisting of individual and group meetings as well as weekly student journals were analyzed. Participation in programming varied by participants. Findings indicate that students who participate at higher levels in activities exclusively offered to program participants exhibited higher levels of change in academic achievement and social integration than those who participated at lower levels. Students who participated at higher levels of program activities had larger increases in GPA after the intervention and participated in non-program co-curricular activities at higher rates than other participants when controlled for previous levels of participation, previous GPA, and individual characteristics. Interviews of program and University administrators and faculty involved with program participants were also analyzed. Faculty and staff highlighted the impact of academic integration activities over social integration. Ongoing impact of the program did not appear significant when reviewing student academic progress one year after the start of the intervention.",,,
812,On the Nature of Practical Reasons,"My dissertation pursues the reverse order of explanation. I propose that we should ground the notion of being a reason in the notion of rational agency. To delineate such a view, we need a more substantive account of rational agency. I favor a constitutivist approach to rational agency according to which actions and beliefs are subject to certain norms (i.e. rational norms) simply in virtue of being the sort of things they are. I argue that the Aristotelian form of constitutivism I develop is preferable to Kantian constitutivism, as defended by C. Korsgaard and S. Engstrom. On a Kantian picture, practical norms can be derived from the form of practical reason. According to Kantian constitutivism, this is because rational agency is constituted by practical norms, similar to the way that chess is constituted by its norms, i.e., its rules. Chapter I discusses Korsgaard's version according to which an action is the kind of thing it is because it performs its function, which is to make an agent a unified person. An agent constitutes herself through her actions. However, I argue that Korsgaard is committed to the implausible view that an agent loses its capacity to act when she does not exercise it properly. I also argue that her account of agency is not substantial enough to ground substantial norms. Moreover, associating one's capacity to act with sophisticated norms, Korsgaard is committed to a hyper-intellectualized account of action. This is a problem she shares with Engstrom. Chapter II discusses Engstrom's view. According to Engstrom, practical norms are constitutive of one's capacity for practical knowledge (i.e. knowledge of what to do). That is, Engstrom thinks that to will is to exercise the capacity for practical knowledge (i.e. to will involves the judgment that the action is good) and one does not exercise one's capacity for practical knowledge properly (i.e. one's practical judgment does not amount to knowledge) if one's will does not conform to its form. Following Kant, Engstrom thinks that one has an implicit cognition of the form of one's will and is guided by it when one exercises one's capacity for practical knowledge. Discussing various forms of implicit knowledge, I argue that it is implausible to think that the form of the will is present in one's psychology even implicitly. Consequently, one cannot be guided by the form of the will. The second part of this study concerns my positive account of the nature of practical reasons. Chapter III, which set the stage for my positive account in chapter IV, concerns the notions of function and the good. I argue that the notion of function cannot be reduced to biological or causal notions. The function of an item is usually its characteristic activity. I argue that the notion of function has a close connection to the notion of essence or life-form. The notion of life-form can be explained by facts about an organism's nature and environment which can ground an objective conception of that organism's good. In chapter IV, I argue that actions aim at the good. Many philosophers, among them G.E.M. Anscombe, J. Raz, B. Willams and D. Davidson, who defend the doctrine of the guise of the good understand it as the idea that the object of intention is taken by the agent to be good. I argue that this is implausible. Further, I argue that the doctrine of the guise of the good should be understood in the same manner that we understand the thesis that beliefs aim at the truth. That is, we should understand it as saying that the formal object of a practical attitude is to bring about the good. This requires a teleological conception of practical attitudes. I argue for this teleological conception of practical attitudes on the grounds that it can explain why practical attitudes need rationalization. If so, a practical state is defective if it does not bring about the good i.e. if it does not bring about its object or if its object is not good. (Abstract shortened by UMI.).",,,
813,Emergent phenomena in Mott/band insulator heterostructures,"The discovery of a two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of two insulating oxides (such as LaAlO3/SrTiO 3) has attracted a significant amount of attention for novel oxide based electronics and fundamental physics studies. While most studies have been focused on LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures less attention has been given to other material systems. Here, we present recent results on a different material system, GdTiO3/SrTiO3. GdTiO 3 is a ferrimagnetic Mott insulator with a polar (001)c surface, while SrTiO3 is a band insulator with a non-polar (001) surface. In this study, GdTiO3 and SrTiO3 layers were grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. Electrical measurements showed the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the GdTiO3/SrTiO 3 interface with total sheet carrier density of ~ 3x10 14 cm-2 per interface. The staggered band alignment between GdTiO3 and SrTiO3 causes the 2DEG to be located on the SrTiO3 side of the interface. Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations of the longitudinal resistance in a quantizing magnetic field were observed, indicating two-dimensionality of the electron gas. Ferromagnetic behavior was observed in both GdTiO3/SrTiO3 (where SrTiO 3 is doped by the interface) and La-doped SrTiO3 systems. We also discuss electron correlation effects in this system.",,,
814,Using the Pivotal Areas of Initiations and Self-Management to Target Social Conversation Skills in Adolescents with Autism,"Impairments in social communication are one of the defining characteristics of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, there are only a handful of studies that investigate interventions to improve social conversation skills in adolescents with ASD. To address this gap in the literature, this study investigated the outcome of a self-management intervention to ask on-topic questions during naturalistic social conversation. To examine the effect of this novel intervention, a non-concurrent multiple baseline across participants design was employed. Three adolescents with ASD, ages 12, 13, and 15, participated in this study. The data supported that with intervention, the participants were able to increase the number of questions they initiated in conversation and improved in their ability to use question-asking to maintain a single topic of conversation. The intervention also resulted in a substantial increase in the percentage of participant utterances that contained a statement or question that maintained the topic and continued the conversation. Additionally, the participants decreased their use of minimal responses during conversation, suggesting that the participants were able to play a more active role in the conversation. Support for fading of the intervention and generalization to new conversational partners was found. Lastly, results from a social validity measure indicated that there were widespread gains in global pragmatic behavior when comparing conversations at baseline and generalization. The findings are discussed in relation to theoretical implications and clinical significance.",,,
815,"An Analysis of Shape, Scaling and Knotting in Polymer Models With and Without Excluded Volume","We will analyze shape and knotting in two polymer models: ideal rings and off-lattice self avoiding walks. To describe the scaling and local shape of ideal rings, we will present two characteristics focusing on the shape and contribution of subsegments: the squared radius of gyration of subsegments and the squared internal end to end distance, which we define to be the average squared distance between vertices k edges apart. We calculate the exact averages of these values over the space of all such ideal rings (not just a calculation of the order of these averages) and compare these to the corresponding values for open chains. This comparison will show that the structure of ideal rings is similar to that of ideal chains for only exceedingly short lengths. These results will be corroborated by numerical experiments. They will be used to analyze the convergence of our generation method and the effect of knotting on these characteristics of shape. We will then describe a new algorithm, which we refer to as the reflection method, to generate random walks of specified thickness in R 3 and prove that our method is ergodic. The data resulting from our implementation of this method will allows us to describe the complex relationship between the presence and nature of knotting and size, thickness and shape of the walk. We will expand on the current understanding of excluded volume by analyzing how scaling of the squared radius of gyration is effected by the introduction of thickness. We will also examine the profound effect of thickness on knotting in open chains.",,,
816,High Performance Signal-Pole Multi-Throw T/R Switch Design for Cellular Applications,"This thesis present a novel single-pole-six-throw (SP6T) transmit/receive (T/R) antenna switch for quad-band (0.85/0.9/1.8/1.9-GHz) GSM/W-CDMA operation and a single-pole-ten-throw (SP10T) T/R switch smart phone applications with ESD co-design, implemented in a high volume 180-nm thick-film Silicon on Insulator (SOI) CMOS process. The SP6T T/R switch employs a novel asymmetric topology for Tx/Rx branch for GSM operation and a switchable double LC-tank as a variable impedance block to ease the tradeoff among linearity, Insertion Loss (IL) and isolation. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed SP6T T/R switch is the first multi-band T/R switch using LC-tank which is fabricated. For SP10T T/R switch, an optimization technique of ESD co-design is presented and demonstrated in the thesis. The unique ESD simulation design methodology allows full-chip design optimization and minimizes the performance degradation caused by the ESD blocks. The SOI technology facilitates the design of high performance SPNT T/R switch. High substrate resistance of SOI improves isolation and linearity performance and enables the fabrication of high Q on-chip inductor, which significantly improves isolation performance. In addition, feed-forward capacitors (FFC) and AC-floating techniques are also employed to improve the linearity and power handling ability. The measured P--0.1dB, IL and Tx-Rx isolation in the lower/upper band of SP6T switch are 37.2 dBm/35.6 dBm, 0.45 dB/0.75 dB, and 45 dB/40 dB, respectively. These results demonstrate the attractiveness of thick film SOI for the design of multimode cellular switches and monolithically integrated RF transmit modules compared to the incumbent technologies of GaAs pHEMT and bulk CMOS technology. The design in SOI CMOS offers the potential for more compact and lower cost RF frond-end modules (FEM) by integrating the T/R switch, antenna tuning module and control logic on one chip.",,,
817,Point-to-Point Control near Heteroclinic Orbits: Plant and Controller Optimality Conditions,"In this thesis we consider the simultaneous optimization of the controller and plant in a one degree-of-freedom system. In particular we are interested in optimal trajectories between fixed points connected by heteroclinic orbits. We find that designing the plant dynamics to have a heteroclinic connection between target states enables low energy transfer between the states. We use a nested optimization strategy to find the optimal plant dynamics and control effort to transition between states. Additionally, we uncover plant optimality conditions which reduce the complexity of the optimization.",,,
818,High Distance Heegaard Splittings via Dehn Twists,"In 1987, Andrew Casson and Cameron Gordon proved that a certain class of 3-manifolds admit strongly irreducible Heegaard splittings. These 3-manifolds were constructed by beginning with a weakly reducible Heegaard splitting and performing Dehn surgery on a sufficiently complicated knot lying in the splitting surface. John Hempel generalized the notion of strong irreducibility in 2001 by defining the distance of a Heegaard splitting, with strong irreducibility equivalent to distance greater than or equal to 2. Subsequent results have demonstrated a strong connection between this distance and the topology of the ambient 3-manifold. In the same paper, Hempel proved the existence of Heegaard splittings of arbitrarily high distance by using a high power of a pseudo-Anosov map. Later findings showed that high distance Heegaard splittings could also be obtained via Dehn surgery. These methods start with a Heegaard splitting of some 3-manifold (often the double of a handlebody), and then by an iterative process construct a knot K lying in the splitting surface such that Dehn surgery on K produces a Heegaard splitting of high distance. These results seemed to indicate that all such knots K that admit a high distance splitting after generic Dehn surgery should satisfy some general criterion. We provide a sufficient condition for Dehn surgery on a knot K to produce a high distance Heegaard splitting. This result can be stated as a natural extension of the work of Casson and Gordon: by picking a knot K of sufficient complexity in the splitting surface, then there is a lower bound on the distance of the Heegaard splitting obtained via Dehn surgery on K that is dependent on the choice of slope for the surgery. We also give an upper bound on the distance of any Heegaard splitting obtained in this manner that depends on the complexity of K. Combining these two bounds, we show that for a fixed K and a generic choice of slope, we can bound the distance of the constructed Heegaard splitting within a range of 2 and, in certain special cases, determine the splitting's exact distance. This is currently the only method of obtaining Heegaard splittings with a known exact high distance that does not require pseudo-Anosov maps.",,,
819,Characterization of Toxic Peptides Delivered By Contact Dependent Inhibition (CDI) Systems,"Bacteria live in many diverse environments and have evolved several strategies to inhibit the growth of neighboring microbe competitors. One such system that has been recently characterized is Contact-Dependent Inhibition (CDI). CDI is a type V secretion system encoded by a three gene locus consisting of cdiB, cdiA, and cdiI, and is widespread amongst alpha, beta, and gamma probacteria CdiB acts as the outer-membrane export channel for CdiA, which extends outward from the surface of the cell. CdiA contains a C-terminal toxin domain (CdiA-CT) that is translocated into neighboring cells upon contact, resulting in growth inhibition. CdiI is an immunity peptide for the toxic domain of CdiA and prevents autoinhibition of the cell. CdiA is highly conserved within a given bacterial species, but is highly polymorphic at the C-terminus. CdiI is also polymorphic, covarying with the CdiA-CT. Together, the CdiA-CT and CdiI proteins form functional and highly specific toxin/immunity pairs that allow CDI+ bacteria to inhibit the growth of neighbors and compete in an environmental niche. This thesis addresses several of the specific biochemical activities of the CdiA-CT toxins present in different bacterial species in order to provide an explanation of how CDI inhibits target cell growth. Chapter 1 describes various systems which are utilized by bacteria to compete with neighboring cells, including colicins and type III-VI secretion systems. In addition, a summary of what is currently known about the CDI system is presented, including the delivery pathway and previously characterized toxin activities in order to differentiate this system from other modes of bacterial competition. Chapter 2 focuses on the biochemical activities of several toxins that are found in environmental strains of Burkholderia pseudomallei. Chapter 3 provides a comparison study between two distinct toxin/immunity pairs from different species (B. pseudomallei and E. coli), including structural and biochemical comparisons. In Chapter 4 a separate contact-dependent inhibition system encoded by the Rhs proteins of Dickeya dadantii is discussed. I show that these Rhs systems are responsible for the delivery of Rhs-CT effectors into target cells, and that these toxins exhibit DNase activity. Chapter 5 provides a summary of the results presented in the previous chapters, and outlines several of the questions remaining about the mechanisms surrounding CDI and Rhs toxin delivery systems. We believe that this research contributes to the biochemical knowledge of how toxin domains inhibit cell growth.",,,
820,Jarhead - Analyzing and Detecting Malicious Java Applets,"Java applets have increasingly been used as a vector to deliver drive-by download attacks that bypass the sandboxing mechanisms of the browser's Java Virtual Machine and compromise the user's environment. Unfortunately, the research community has not given to this problem the attention it deserves, and, as a consequence, the state-of-the-art approaches to the detection of malicious Java applets are based either on simple signatures or on the use of honeyclients, which are both easily evaded. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to the detection of malicious Java applets based on static code analysis. Our approach extracts a number of features from Java applets, and then uses supervised machine learning to produce a classifier. We implemented our approach in a tool, called Jarhead, and we tested its effectiveness on a large, real-world dataset. The results of the evaluation show that, given a sufficiently large training dataset, this approach is able to reliably detect both known and previously-unseen real-world malicious applets.",,,
821,Microfabrication of Bio-Inspired Adhesive Systems,"Most geckos can rapidly attach and detach from most surfaces using the weak but universal van der Waals forces. This ability is attributed to the hierarchical structure of their feet (involving macroscale toe pads, arrays of 'seta' microfibers, and nanoscale spatula tips), and how these anisotropic structures are moved (articulated) to generate strong adhesion and friction forces on gripping that rapidly relax on releasing. Inspired by the gecko adhesive system, various structured surfaces have been fabricated suitable for robotic applications. First, vast arrays of both vertical and tilted rectangular PDMS micro-flaps were fabricated using micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication techniques. Friction and adhesion force properties were investigated using both a Surface Forces Apparatus (SFA) and a custom-built tester with larger contact area. Demonstrating the importance of both asymmetric tilted structures (such as the fibers in geckos) and an optimal articulation mechanism, it was found that the anisotropic structure of the tilted micro-flaps resulted in highly anisotropic adhesion and friction forces when articulated along different directions: high friction and adhesion when sheared along the tilt direction, and low friction and adhesion when sheared against tilt. Then, the friction and adhesion properties of the tilted micro-flaps were characterized against five different rough glass substrates with non-uniformly spaced asperities. It was found that while adhesion and friction anisotropy was maintained on all substrates, the magnitudes showed an unexpected increase at intermediate height RMS roughness due to a geometric match between the dimensions of the flaps and the average spacing between asperities, leading to interlocking. This both demonstrates the importance of substrate surface structure as well as indicates how fibrillar adhesives could be tailored to achieve higher forces on specific surfaces. Finally, the importance of both tilt angle and fiber shape was demonstrated with tilted half-cylinder PDMS microfiber arrays. With suitable articulation, the adhesion force was switched from a maximum of 9.4 kPa for strong attachment to a minimum of zero for easy detachment. Practical applications require adhesives to be highly durable in addition to being anisotropic - this material retained up to 77% of the initial adhesion after 10,000 test cycles.",,,
822,From 6 to 163: The Chinese International Student Experience in a Time of Increased Enrollment at a University of California Campus,"At UCSB the number of degree seeking undergraduate Chinese international students increased from 6 to 163 between 2010 and 2012. With such a controversial and much discussed topic of international student enrollment at U.S universities, this was the perfect time for me to interview Chinese international students. With the help of Kathy Charmaz' (2006) descriptive book on how to use grounded theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1965) and a computer based software AntConc 3.2 created by professor Laurence Anthony, I used a quantitative interview method to analyze my interviews with twelve undergraduate and graduate students. The interviews revealed that these students had highly educated parents with the intentions of sending their students abroad from an early age. This in combination with the collectivist conservative culture and the concept of filial piety (Deutsch, 2004) create hard working students with a drive to attend prestigious universities for academic, cultural, and social reasons. As previous research has shown, Chinese international students focus on academics first and then leisure (Li & Stodolska, 2006) with challenges both academic and social. The UCSB academic and social culture is unique (e.g. acceptance of sports and fitness), thus creating both a unique lifestyle and experience for Chinese students.",,,
823,Ketenes in Polymer Science: An Emerging Methodology for Applications in Materials Chemistry,"Function matters in materials science, and methodology that provides paths to multiple functions in one step are to be prized. Therefore, we have introduced the versatile reactivity of ketenes to polymer chemistry. New materials synthesized take advantage of Meldrum's acid as both a synthetic building block and a thermolytic precursor to dialkyl ketenes. In many cases, ketenes are directly detected by their characteristic infrared absorption, among other methods, and are stable in ambient conditions. The inherent property of ketenes to provide crosslinking via dimerization, to act as a reactive chemical handle via addition, or both, provides a simple methodology for the downstream engineering of synthetic polymers. The advances described herein provide a platform technology for diverse applications in materials science. The key innovation to realizing access to robust ketenes was the use of Meldrum's acid as a modular, stable, and user-friendly ketene precursor that could be incorporated into a number of polymer systems. The easy design and synthesis of Meldrum's acid-containing polymers allowed us to implement this methodology into a wide variety of well-studied materials including vinyl polymers, polyolefins, polynorbornenes, and polyethers. The utility of ketenes has enabled them to contribute to a number of challenges in materials science, including the generation of functional, nanopatterned surfaces by microcontact printing, a synthesis-driven approach toward controlling the properties of crosslinked polyolefin materials, and the fabrication of mechanically robust, solvent stable nanostructured templates. Furthermore, we have tuned the chemistry of the Meldrum's acid building blocks in order to lower the ketene formation temperature by over 50 _C, enabling our methodology to be employed under mild processing conditions and providing new mechanistic insights into thermolytic reactions. The rediscovery of ketenes as a versatile and valuable functional group in polymer chemistry conjures the prolific career arc of Hermann Staudinger and serves as another example of under-appreciated functional groups contributing to polymer science. The facile access to Meldrum's acid containing polymers and the well-developed chemistry of ketenes assure that this methodology will be a powerful tool for chemists, materials scientists, and engineers in the future.",,,
824,"At What Cost: United States Counter-terror Policy, U.S. Reputation, and American Public Opinion","As the United States aggressively pursues transnational terrorists, what value does the American public put on the United States' reputation abroad? This project investigated the American public's opinion about the United States' reputation and influence abroad, and their willingness to bear costs---in terms of damaged reputation and influence---in order to feel secure. Data were collected via an on-line survey experiment. I created six different scenarios in which I manipulated the way a threat was described and the way the costs associated with a policy response were described. The threat description varied by either including specific information about a domestic threat or presenting an ambiguous warning about a global threat. After reading the threat description, subjects were asked to select the best response to that threat from a menu of four increasingly aggressive policy options. Descriptions of the potential costs associated with each of these four options varied in three ways: descriptions that emphasized non-material, reputational costs, descriptions that emphasized material costs only, or had no information about potential costs at all. I found that if the costs associated with policy options were framed as damage done to U.S. reputation and diplomatic relationships, people were less likely to pursue more aggressive options.",,,
825,"Submission versus Transgression: Farid al-Din `Attar Nishapuri's Embrace of Diversity in ""Tadhkirat al-Awliya"", ""Ilahi-nama"", ""Musibat-nama"", and ""Mantiq al-Tayr""","This dissertation delineates the intersections of transgression, law, inclusion and exclusion, self and Other, in Farid al-Din &grave;Attar Nishapuri's (1145-1221) treatment of class, gender, sexuality, and religion. I examine four sets of love stories that &grave;Attar used in his writings to comment on issues of law, transgression, human diversity and inclusiveness. From literature to modern theory, this dissertation explores the reasons for &grave;Attar's inclusion of peripheral individuals in his works, and it integrates literary theory and a comparative medieval European perspective. Applying modern theoretical notions to medieval society, which produced its own perspectives on life, religion, society, and culture, might appear anachronistic; however, it is essential to inquire whether modern insights about these notions can help us better understand medieval works, or whether these ideas are exclusive to early modern and modern relations. Without such an analysis, we are left with an inadequate understanding of medieval culture and literature. Previous scholarship has investigated similar comparative notions in works such as Ibn al- &grave;Arabi's and Rumi's. However, research on &grave;Attar's works from a modern theoretical perspective in a comparative context has been limited. My study remedies this gap in the literature by examining the ways through which &grave;Attar engages with these modern notions. It shows that whereas members of minority populations are not fully integrated in modern Iranian society, inclusiveness was thinkable in the medieval period by extraordinary Sufi writers such as &grave;Attar. Throughout, I argue that &grave;Attar portrays his submission to the divine by accepting and embracing human diversity through Sufism and love of the divine. His works, Tadhkirat al-Awliya, Ilahi-nama, Musibat-nama and Mantiq al-Tayr, are precious for they show that inclusiveness was thinkable in the medieval period. This project illustrates that &grave;Attar's explorations of medieval inter-subjectivity are significant for our understanding of subjectivity in a modern world. It introduces new readings of &grave;Attar's works and encourages explorations of new possibilities, which can dismantle established narratives of our present experience and (mis)perceptions about human diversity and minorities.",,,
826,New computational methods for solute precipitate nucleation,"Solute precipitate nucleation is important to a wide variety of processes including pharmaceutical crystallization, biomineralization, and material synthesis. However, methods for simulating these multicomponent nucleation processes lag far behind methods for simpler single component nucleation processes. The impasse stems from the difficulty combining rare events methods with simulation frameworks that maintain a constant chemical potential (supersaturation) as a nucleus grows in solution. The formation of a nucleus is a completion between the chemical potential reward for the formation of a stable phase and penalty for the formation of an interface. The penalty for the formation of an interface is the only reason a barrier to nucleation exists in the classical picture. The ability of solvents and additives to preferentially reduce the interfacial free energy of one polymorph over another may be an important factor in polymorph selection. Accordingly, interfacial free energies are a central focus of this thesis. We present new simulation methodologies to model solute precipitate nucleation and determine the structure and interfacial free energy of nuclei in solution. We introduce the Potts lattice gas (PLG), as a model for solute precipitate nucleation. Using the PLG, we developed the mitosis method to calculate the interfacial free energy of nuclei in solution. For mechanistic studies of polymorph selection order parameters must be developed that distinguish polymorphs. To solve this problem, we developed polymorph specific local RMSD order parameters. These order parameters are used to analyze the effects of the additive NaCl on the structure of glycine nuclei in solution, providing insight into polymorph selection. For a quantitative analysis of the effects of additives on the interfacial free energy of nuclei, we present a new application of free energy perturbations. Applying this method to glycine, we show that NaCl preferentially reduces the interfacial free energy of gamma-glycine nuclei over alpha-glycine nuclei in aqueous solution, as implied by experiments. The methodologies presented here provide a framework for determining the effects of additives and solvents on the interfacial free energy and structure of nuclei in solution.",,,
827,Three to Five Years Work Experience Required: Exploring the Role of Past Work Experience in Neophyte and Veteran Newcomer Assimilation Processes and Organizational Identification,"The implications of the recent recession and workplace trends that evidence higher rates of separations and hires indicate a need to understand how past work experience influences newcomers' willingness and ability to assimilate into new workplaces and identify with new organizations. Historically, past work experience has been acknowledged as an individual difference variable but generally has not been explored explicitly with regard to organizational assimilation and identification. Notably, Beyer and Hannah (2002) conducted a qualitative study of veteran newcomers and identified three resources that veteran newcomers brought with them into new workplaces: work-related personal identities, professional know-how, and adjustment tactics. However, comparative work examining neophyte and veteran newcomer assimilation processes and identification has not yet been investigated. An online questionnaire, completed by 294 individuals who had started jobs within the previous three months, measured participants' assimilation, proactive socialization, information seeking, and organizational identification with both their current and previous organizations. Results revealed that 95% of veteran newcomers relied on previously acquired knowledge and almost 40% sought information from a former supervisor or coworker. Past work experience generally did not affect outcome measures as hypothesized; however, post-hoc analyses evidence much greater understanding about the complexity of assimilation and identification, as they are affected by other variables such as education, age, and organizational type. The results of this study raise important theoretical and methodological questions about organizational assimilation and the role of past work experience. Though initially surprising, the results suggest that newcomers, regardless of past work experience, are assimilated in similar ways and evidence the complexity of the process and the study of assimilation and identification processes.",,,
828,The 2006 Penguin Revolution and the 2011 Chilean Winter: Chilean Students' Fight for Education Reform,"The 2006 student movement, termed the Penguin Revolution for the black and white uniforms worn by high school students, and the 2011 student movement, called the Chilean Winter, a reference to the ""Arab Spring,"" have captivated the attention of the media and scholars alike. However, little work has been done to place these student movements into a broader historical context. Historically, Chilean students have had a long record of both general political activism and specific activism over educational matters dating back over 100 years. Even the most recent student protests, which developed into a broader movement against the neoliberal policies implemented under the dictator General Augusto Pinochet, were preceded by demonstrations with similar demands dating back to at least 2000. However, these precedents do not explain why the movements developed between 2000 and 2011, rather than immediately after the fall of the dictatorship in 1990. I argue that part of the reason is because that the students in the twenty-first century were the first ones to attend high school and college who were not raised under the dictatorship and for that reason they did not fear the repression and violence their predecessors, who grew up predominantly under the dictatorship, experienced. Thus, an analysis of the history of student political activism in Chile, the history of Chilean politics, the history of the Chilean education system, and the neoliberal reforms, especially in education, is necessary to provide a historical, political, and social context for the recent student movements.",,,
829,Optimal Mass Transport and Curvature Bounds,"We explore the interactions between optimal mass transport theory and the geometry of the underlying (and other related) spaces. In particular, we present a sketch of the proof of Luis Caffarelli's contraction theorem and consider its geometric consequences and possible extensions, especially in the context of spherical geometry. We study also the concept of Hessian metrics --- one of the geometric tools implemented by Eugenio Calabi in his investigation of the properties of solutions of the general Monge-Ampere equation for the Euclidean space ( R n, dRn) --- and we summarize one of the significant contributions arising from Calabi's work as a lower Ricci curvature bound. In the end, we give an exposition of the author's recent results concerning modified Hessian pseudo-metrics. These results generalize a portion of Calabi's theory of Hessian metrics to n-dimensional space forms of constant positive sectional curvature and lead to new lower Ricci curvature bounds. We emphasize throughout this dissertation those connections relating the theory of optimal mass transport and curvature bounds.",,,
830,Chemical Approaches for Hetero-structured Thermoelectric Materials,"The large-scale use of thermo-electrics for conversion of waste heat to electricity is currently limited by materials' cost and efficiency. The efficiency of a thermoelectric conversion is normally expressed through its figure of merit (zT=S 2sigmaT/kappa), where S is the Seebeck coefficient, sigma is the electrical conductivity, kappa is the thermal conductivity, and T is the absolute temperature. The key challenge in improving zT is the conflict dependence of the variables (S, sigma and kappa). A strategy that could decouple the variables and thereby lead to an efficient and economical thermoelectric conversion is to fabricate nanoscaled hetero-structured materials through a large-scale and low-cost chemical route. In my research, two types of hetero-structures were demonstrated to have enhanced zT. The type I structure is a semiconductor matrix with mesoscaled pores. The pores are proved to substantially reduce kappa more than sigma by scattering the phonons at interfaces. In the type II structure, metallic Ag nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed in a Sb2Te3 matrix using hydrazinium chemistry. After improving the thermal stability of Ag nanoinclusions in telluride by atomic layer deposition (ALD), a zT value of 1.0 at 460 K has been achieved, a record for a solution-processed film. This enhancement is mainly due to improvement of the Seebeck coefficient via a hot carrier filtering effect, along with the efficient scattering of phonons. I believe that this new methodology will inspire the thermoelectric community in the development of improved thermoelectric systems.",,,
831,Tracking our writing theorists through citations,"Working between bibliometrics and theories in the sociology of knowledge, this research demonstrates a method for aggregating and studying the content of citations in order to both quantitatively capture and qualitatively describe significant patterns in the uses of prominent writing theorists and their books over time. Realized specifically as a tool for use across composition-rhetoric, this approach expands our ability to reflexively monitor how highly cited authors and their texts have ""acoustic dimensions"" that influence knowledge making and breaking across the field. Given the results that this kind of research produces, we can better appreciate the historical and evolving leverage that these ""knowledge assets"" represent and therefore be more informed and convincing participants in the discourse communities through which we, collectively, act to advance knowledge. Demonstrations of this novel approach to citation research were applied to the education and discourse theorist James Moffett and his (1968) book Teaching the universe of discourse..",,,
832,Trustworthy Distributed Search and Retrieval over the Internet,"Currently, our trust in the accessibility of information over the Internet and the Web depends on benign and unbiased administration of centralized search engines. Unfortunately, a centralized search engine can be modified to filter, conceal, or censor information. We present a decentralized search and retrieval system, named iTrust, to address these problems. First, we address the design and implementation of iTrust. Source nodes distribute metadata for information along with the address of the information to randomly chosen nodes. Similarly, requesting nodes distribute requests that contain keywords to randomly chosen nodes. Nodes that receive a request compare the keywords with the metadata they hold, and return the URL of the information to the requesting node if they have a match. For appropriate values of the parameters, the probability of a match is very high. Next, we present statistical algorithms for detecting and defending against malicious attacks. Our statistical detection algorithm compares the empirical and analytical probabilities of a match to estimate the proportion of non-operational nodes in the membership. The defensive adaptation algorithm then increases the number of nodes to which the requests are distributed to maintain the same probability of a match when some of the nodes are non operational as when all of the nodes are operational. Then, we consider an environment in which nodes join or leave the membership rapidly. Our adaptive membership protocol allows nodes to discover changes in the membership using the iTrust messages and responses that it normally receives. A node then dynamically adjusts its requesting rate, and sends more request messages to compensate for nodes from which it did not receive a response. The protocol exploits messages already being sent to distribute metadata or requests, thus reducing the need for additional messages. Finally, we combine our adaptive membership protocol with our algorithms for detecting and defending against malicious nodes. The combined adaptation algorithm estimates changes in the membership to improve the behavior of iTrust. We demonstrate that the combined adaptive algorithm is effective and robust when the membership churn is high and when there are malicious nodes in the membership.",,,
833,Forced in vivo Transdifferentiation and Remodeling of Differentiated Cells and Organs in the Nematode C. elegans,"Early embryonic cells in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans are pluripotent and can be forced to adopt alternative fates by ectopic expression of key regulators of endoderm, mesoderm, or ectoderm development. The ability of embryonic cells to be reprogrammed from their normal lineage fates is restricted to early embryogenesis but can be extended slightly by removing chromatin remodeling, or Notch signaling factors. Differentiated somatic cells in larvae and adults are generally considered irreversibly developmentally locked. We found that brief ectopic expression of ELT-7, a GATA transcription factor that regulates endoderm differentiation, reprograms fully differentiated somatic cells into intestine-like cells without requiring removal of inhibitory factors. Cells that form the pharynx and somatic gonad appear specifically competent to transdifferentiate into intestine. The reprogrammed cells express intestine-specific genes, paralleling loss of expression of the original cell-fate specific genes. Reprogrammed cells undergo comprehensive structural remodeling, as evidenced at the ultrastructural level in electron micrographs. Cells that form the somatic gonad become reorganized after ectopic ELT-7 expression to form a lumen with all of the structural features of the endogenous intestine. Thus, we may have observed forced ""transorganogenesis"" of a fully formed organ into another organ. The specification and differentiation of the pharynx, as orchestrated by PHA-4/FoxA transcription factor, may be required for postmitotic reprogramming of the pharynx into intestine. Our results show that terminally-differentiated postmitotic cells can be remodeled to cells of another germ layer in the absence of cell division or prior removal of the original cell fate, and suggest that susceptibility to reprogramming is determined by a combination of cellular context and the factors used to induce cell fate change.",,,
834,The Capacity to Foresee and Forestall Lost: Tracing the Ecocritical Response to Climate Change,"Ecocriticism came into being in response to the unfolding environmental crisis, and the first ecocritics thought of themselves as being engaged in a political project, similar to feminist scholarship, where the goal was to affect progressive reforms through applied scholarship. However, the initial hopes for ecocriticism were quickly abandoned, and unlike feminist scholarship, critical race, or LGBT studies, which are generally sympathetic to the corresponding social movements, mature ecocriticism often tends to be inimical toward environmentalism and environmentalists. This is evidenced by the fact that while critiques of environmentalism are commonplace in ecocritical discourse, there is an almost complete absence of critiques regarding the role of financial, corporate, governmental, religious, political, and academic institutions in creating environmental crises. The asymmetry of the ecocritical critique suggests that a dominant strain of ecocritical thought is more closely aligned with conservative, anti-reflexive elements of society than with progressive movements.",,,
835,Guided by Great Feelings of Love: Using Photovoice and Critical Pedagogy to Document the Life Experiences of Undocumented Latino/a Students in Higher Education,"Undocumented students have fought for the ability to attend institutions of higher education, but research has often overlooked their experiences outside of the classroom. Weaving together Freirean critical pedagogy and photovoice to create a type of advocacy participatory action research, this project followed eight undocumented Latina/o undergraduates at a Research I institution over the course of one academic year. Using critical pedagogy, the participants and I co-created a class in which we explored the intersections of race, class, educational access, and citizenship. By using critical pedagogical methods the students in the project were able to dictate the direction of both the class and the research itself. During this time the participants also used photovoice to create photo diaries of their lives, exploring what it means to be undocumented college students. They determined that while research had been conducted concerning undocumented students in higher education, their particular experiences as undocumented persons had not been fully captured. As such, this project sheds valuable light on the ways in which being undocumented affected these students' personal relationships with family, friends, and lovers.",,,
836,Network Design in the Big-Data Age,"Today's computing systems are in the midst of a transformation driven by proliferation of big data. Explosive growth in data-driven applications is creating unprecedented demands on communication networks. From large data centers to smartphones and tablets, networking infrastructures are struggling to keep up with both the volume of data and the complexity of protocols needed for timely and reliable data delivery. Traditional approaches to network design and management allocate network resources in a static and long-term manner. They are simply unable to handle today's massive and dynamic traffic loads. In this dissertation, we develop new methods to design networks capable of handling the volume and unpredictable dynamics of today's data traffic. We add aspects of flexibility into existing network designs so that each network entity can obtain resources on the fly based on current needs. Following this principle, we address several high-impact problems related to big data. Our first research area is supporting distributed computing applications in data centers, which requires timely and reliable delivery of massive data across network entities. This is highly challenging in today's data centers that deploy wired networks with a fixed amount of fiber to each network rack. Once deployed, wired networks are extremely expensive and time consuming to modify or update. This static bandwidth provisioning falls short when dealing with massive, dynamic traffic, and leads to congestion losses and application downtime. We tackle this problem by using flexible wireless links to augment (or even replace) wired networks. We are the first to identify the fundamental challenges of using wireless links in data centers, and we overcome these challenges using a new wireless primitive called 3D beamforming (bouncing 60GHz beam off the ceiling). Our solution is simple, and yet highly effective. It significantly extends wireless transmission range while reducing interference footprint. Using 3D beamforming links, we demonstrate their efficacy by building robust data and control planes to handle massive and unpredictable traffic patterns. Our second research area focuses on spectrum management in wireless networks. For all wireless transmissions to succeed, they must obtain an adequate amount of spectrum. Historical management policies regulate spectrum statically via long-term national auctions. These traditional auctions are unable to distribute spectrum for fine-grained use (local and short-term use). Therefore they lead to highly inefficient use of spectrum, and create an artificial spectrum scarcity problem. We address this problem by building a much more flexible auction format akin to the eBay marketplace. It dynamically distributes spectrum to users based on their current demands. We are the first to show that existing mechanism designs fail in dynamic spectrum auctions because of the presence of wireless interference. We overcome these challenges by designing new dynamic spectrum auctions that allocate spectrum efficiently while achieving desired economic properties, such as resistance to different types of bidder cheating and collusion. Finally, our research also demonstrates how big data can be used to implement new network designs in practice. To deploy dynamic spectrum auctions, we need to characterize interference conditions accurately across a large number of bidders. Using extensive network measurements, we perform the first empirical study to evaluate the usability of conflict graphs, the most widely used interference model. We study key issues long considered by the wireless community to be serious limitations of this model, and propose techniques to overcome them. Our results validate the usability of conflict graphs for dynamic spectrum auctions as well as general wireless networks. Furthermore, our work offers an efficient online solution to construct conflict graphs on the fly, thus enabling real-time dynamic spectrum auctions across a large number of users. In summary, our work demonstrates that to support massive and highly dynamic traffic in the big-data age, network design must embed flexibility as a key element. Our research has tackled important problems in data centers and wireless networks, and the same design principle is applicable to a wide range of networking systems.",,,
837,The Ego-Depleting Nature of Social Support Provision,"Previous work has shown that supporting close others in times of stress is an important component of satisfying stable relationships. However, providing effective support can be difficult and may come at a cost to the provider. In the present studies, I hypothesized that providing social support to close others may deplete self-regulatory resources---particularly when providers are concerned about their support effectiveness or feel the need to regulate their emotions. I also predicted that providing support for positive events (which may involve less concerns and emotion regulation) may boost self-regulatory resources. In Study 1, a 14-day diary study, participants who reported greater effectiveness concerns and emotion regulation while providing support showed greater depletion as evidenced by greater feelings of depletion, poorer Stroop task performance, and less regulated behaviors (e.g., snapping at close others, overeating). Positive event support was not associated with greater depletion outcomes and was associated with greater goal progress. In Study 2, a couples' laboratory study, I manipulated how concerned individuals were about providing effective support to their romantic partner for a stressful speech task and found that individuals with greater concerns about providing quality support to their partner showed greater evidence of depletion on a hand-grip task after providing support. Finally, Study 3, a laboratory study involved support provisions to a confederate peer, demonstrated that it is the act of providing support (and not just listening to events) that leads to depletion. Taken together, these studies suggest that when individuals are particularly concerned about providing effective support and regulating their emotions, they may incur a cost to the self in terms of reduced self-regulatory resources. Individuals also seem more likely to show concerns and emotion regulation when providing support for negative, as opposed to positive, events.",,,
838,Discipline Practices and School Climate: Exploring Predictors of Discipline Techniques Through an Examination of Staff Perceptions,"The sociocultural inequities and undesirable student outcomes that result from the overuse and misuse of exclusionary and punitive discipline practices reflect serious consequences for school environments and society as a whole. As research on discipline disproportionality with Latino/a students has been inconsistent, the current study utilizes the baseline ethnic distribution method to further explore discipline experiences of this population. In addition, using teachers and staff survey responses from four junior high schools ( N = 168), hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to further understand the social structures that may influence the types of discipline used in schools. Specifically, the relations between adult-student relationships, racial climate, and the use of punitive and positive discipline practices were explored. Results indicate that Latino/a students are significantly more likely to be excluded from school than White students. Racial climate was also found to be a significant moderator in the relation between adult-student relationships and punitive discipline techniques. Implications for theory, research, and practical application are discussed.",,,
839,Integrated Optical Phase-locked Loops,"In modern communication and sensing devices, such as radios, cell phones, computers, and radar, phase-locked loop (PLL) technology is widely applied to enable coherent detection, which has a higher sensitivity and data capacity compared to traditional envelope detection. However, historically the idea of extending this PLL concept into the optical domain has proved difficult. The fundamental difficulty of building an optical phase-locked loop (OPLL) is due to the limited loop bandwidth relative to the laser linewidth and wavelength stability. In order to solve this problem, photonic and electronic integration needs to be applied along with novel system designs. In this Ph.D. dissertation, homodyne and heterodyne OPLLs are designed, fabricated, and implemented based on advanced InGaAsP/InP photonic integration technology, as well as electronic integration. All the optic components needed in the OPLL are integrated monolithically, including a slave laser, a 90-degree hybrid, four high-speed photodetectors, and microstrip transmission lines, optical amplifiers and interconnecting optical waveguides. The integration technology enables stable OPLLs with advanced functionalities. OPLL closed-loop bandwidth has been improved to around 1.1 GHz, and based on this OPLL, a synchronized homodyne receiver is achieved, with a data rate up to 40 Gbit/s. Error free (bit error rate < 10-12) is realized up to 35 Gbit/s. As for sensing and synthesis applications, two lasers are phase locked to each other with an offset frequency range of 40 GHz, and phase-locked frequency sweeping has been achieved. The residual phase noise is smaller than 0.03 rad2 integrating from 100 Hz to 10 GHz. Utilizing the OPLLs demonstrated in this thesis, there are many potential applications. In the area of coherent communication, especially in short or mid distance range, where dispersion is not serious, OPLL-based homodyne receiver has advantages of highest sensitivity, lower power consumption, smaller size and lower cost. In the area of optical sensing and synthesis, many novel coherent optical system can be established by using this OPLL as the key building block, including, but not limited to, light detection and ranging (LIDAR), fiber sensing, optical synthesis, optical tomography and terahertz wave generation.",,,
840,"Objects, Persons, and Animals: A Defense of Animalism","This dissertation aims at defending animalism---the view that human beings such as you and I are numerically identical to animals. However commonsensical this thesis appears to be, many philosophers have denied such a claim. Although various arguments have been offered in favor of animalism, the ""master argument"" for animalism is the Thinking Animal Argument (henceforth, the TAA). The TAA employs only three premises, each of which are plausible at first glance. However, recent objections to animalism (or materialism more broadly) target each premise of the TAA. In this dissertation, I defend each premise from such objections. I begin with an introductory chapter that presents several arguments for animalism, followed by a defense of each premise of the TAA in the next three chapters. Chapter 2 deals with the Overdetermination Argument for compositional nihilism, which claims that there are no composite objects (and hence, no animals). Chapter 3 deals with challenges that go against the claim that the animal in my chair is the literal subject of my thoughts. In Chapter 4, I respond to a criticism which claims that the defense of premise three of the TAA relies on a dubious epistemological principle. Finally in Chapter 5, I show that several anti-animalists arguments can be condensed to a single, general worry, which I label ""the Too Many Candidates Problem"". I briefly present the standard animalist solution to the problem, which requires adopting a strict version of restricted composition. Given the way in which I formulate the problem, it is evident that the animalist has another approach of resolving the Too Many Candidates Problem. I conclude with several possible ways of developing this latter strategy of resolving the problem. Since we can maintain the premises of the TAA, I believe we should accept the conclusion that follows: we are animals.",,,
841,Problems at Work: Spatial Tensions in Modern Workspaces,"Problems at Work: Spatial Tensions in Modern Workspaces combines literary and theoretical representations of workspaces and theories of work with examinations of real contemporary workspaces. In an effort to demonstrate the important role that literary spaces can play in determining ways out of and around corporate capitalism, each chapter addresses a distinct and varied cluster of theories of power and resistance, as well as specific literary representations of work and workspaces. Through the tracing of affect and materiality in fictional representations of work, it can be seen that productive emotional and embodied forces exist within the workers' uses and intentional misuses of office space. Whether or not there is any possibility of uprising against capitalism remains to be seen, but the descriptive performance of the study as a whole represents one possibility for garnering awareness and reinvigorating creative resistant tactics that do not easily fold into capitalist production.",,,
842,"Sayings, Stories, and Symbols: Figurative Language as a Pedagogical Tool for Collegiate Choral Conductors","Collegiate choral conductors often face difficult communication problems when working with students of varying musical backgrounds and learning styles. Figurative language, including phrases, narratives, and gestural symbols, are tools conductors use to communicate musical ideas and motivate singers in choral rehearsals. In this study, I observed rehearsals led by four collegiate choral directors, interviewed these directors, and met with their students to determine how figurative phrases, narratives, and symbols were being employed and why. I analyze the frequency of use of different types of figurative language, and I determine for what purposes conductors use them. I find that the use of figurative discourse---phrases or narratives---can be categorized into four general purposes: to address vocal technique, to address musical expressivity, to encourage personal/emotional connection to the music, or to foster group collaboration. The conductors in my study use figurative phrases more often to address vocal technique and musical expressivity, while they use narratives to promote personal or emotional connection as well as group collaboration. Furthermore, I find that conductors use physical symbols to represent phrases or narratives that have been used in the past. I suggest that figurative language use by choral conductors is not only a pedagogical tool, it also increases the efficiency of rehearsals and, both directly and indirectly, creates a shared choral culture that improves group performance.",,,
843,Indium Phosphide Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors with Emitter Regrowth by Molecular Beam Epitaxy,"A novel InP-based heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) technology using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) regrowth to form the emitter-base heterojunction and emitter capping layers is presented in this dissertation. The motivation for this work is to combining the positive attributes of the SiGe HBT device structure and fabrication technology with the superior attributes of III-V material systems. The intention of this work is to provide initial investigations into the required material properties as well as initial demonstrations of devices with regrown emitters. Low-resistance polycrystalline InAs (poly-InAs) deposited onto silicon nitride (SiNx) dielectric is demonstrated, and an investigation into material property dependencies on deposition conditions is presented. Low-resistance poly-InAs may be used as an emitter capping material in an InP HBT with regrown emitter where the emitter contact material is wider than the base-emitter junction area. An emitter contact area larger than the emitter junction allows scaling of the device to reduce parasitic capacitances without introducing detrimental parasitics to the emitter contact resistance. Such an HBT could be produced using a patterned base-collector template covered in SiNx with openings in the dielectric in areas where emitter junctions are desired. Areas where the base semiconductor is exposed to emitter regrowth would produce a monocrystalline emitter, and areas where deposition occurs onto SiNx would produce polycrystalline material. A graded InAlAs emitter with InAs emitter cap was used in the initial demonstrations of the regrown emitter HBT. Large-area devices were used to successfully demonstrate proof-of-concept devices and to make the first-order improvements required for a small-area RF device demonstration. The first small-area regrown emitter InP HBT with emitter contact area wider than the 0.7 x 8 mum2 base-emitter junction demonstrated 160 GHz peak ft and simultaneous 140 GHz fmax. Further studies into the base-collector template surface preparation process produced an improved regrowth surface with near-epitaxial smoothness. A simplified, abrupt InP emitter regrowth onto this surface produces regrowth similar to what is observed for growth onto epi-ready InP substrates. The improved regrown emitter HBT with 0.7 x 8 mum2 InP emitter area is used to demonstrate a simultaneous 183 GHz ft and 165 GHz fmax.",,,
844,Making Environmental Markets Work: The International Political Economy of Carbon Markets in Emerging Market Economies,"Perhaps the most defining characteristic of the global economy today is the rise of Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Their success raises important issues about the distribution of global monetary and fiscal power at the international level. And as the EMEs have gained importance, their influence has grown across a range of policy domains. Despite this, the EMEs vary quite dramatically in terms of their social, political and economic goals. How, then, can we best account for the variations we find among the EMEs? This dissertation will explore the argument that the variation in outcomes we find among the EMEs is due to the type of economic institutions prevalent in their economies. In short, it is the variety of capitalism that produces this variation. To better understand how variations in capitalism may influence important outcomes, this dissertation focuses on a sample of 31 EMEs to show that national variations in economic institutions are central to explaining why carbon market formation has been more successful in some countries than in others. My analysis draws on variables from the Varieties of Capitalism literature, along with four control variables, including: macroeconomic stability, infrastructure, public institutions, and population. To analyze the data, I employ both regression and QCA methods as rival tools for explaining these outcomes. Together, these variables are used to explain what type of capitalism produced successful or unsuccessful market formation under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). My research suggests that although economic institutions do play a central part in determining CDM market creation, macroeconomic stability and high population levels may also matter. Also, success in forming CDM markets cannot be determined by the level of development alone. In fact, in this case, the variety of capitalism in each country was found to produce measurable effects on the success of carbon markets there. If specific types of capitalism require differing forms of motivation to bring about the desired policy outcome, current efforts to address climate change may need to adapt. Findings such as these help to provide new insights into how best to design and implement policies across a wide range of issues.",,,
845,"Neutrino Oscillations, the Higgs Boson, and the Private Higgs Model","CESR, PEP, PETRA, ISABELLE, p-bar p colliders, LEP, the tevatron, and ep machines are at various levels of design or construction. They will study the properties of b-matter, see weak intermediaries, and perhaps find the t-quark and the Higgs boson. Never before was there such a bestiary waiting to be discovered; and what surprises will be found! - S. L. Glashow (""The Future of Elementary Particle Physics,"" Quarks and Leptons, NATO Advanced Study Institutes Series Volume 61, 1980, pp 687-713). The situation in 1980 was clearly different from the present situation in 2013, in which we face the very real possibilty that no new degrees of freedom will ever again be within reach of a collider. In an intriguing twist of fate, this very fact results in a sharp paradox for fundamental physics: the Higgs mass should be MP/m h _ 1017 times larger than it actually is, and the vacuum energy density of the universe should be (M P/A)4 _ (1031)4 times larger than it actually is, and apparently nature refuses to give us any more clues as to why. These together are what I would call the main problem of 21st century physics: despite all of the predictive success of particle physics so far, we must find a way to suitably modify the rules of quantum field theory, lest we accept the unproductive defeatist attitude that our universe is simply fine-tuned. In the meantime, there is much interesting work to be done in more ""traditional"" particle physics: we have learned that neutrinos actually have tiny but nonzero masses, which is clear and unambiguous evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model. I will allocate the first third of this document to phenomena related to neutrino oscillations. In particular, I would like to argue that some of the apparent differences between neutrino mixing and quark mixing are to an extent illusory, and actually many aspects of the two sectors can be understood in a coherent framework for extending the Standard Model. The remaining two-thirds of this document are devoted in one way or another to phenomena associated with the Higgs sector of the Standard Model. Now that the Large Hadron Collider has finally observed what is presumably the Higgs boson with mass mh &ap; 125 GeV, every parameter in the Standard Model is known. However, there remains an enormous freedom to extend the scalar sector of the Standard Model, and I will study a particular multi-Higgs framework, which is called the ""Private Higgs"" model. Within this framework it becomes clear that the ratios of Yukawa couplings may be completely uncorrelated with the ratios of the corresponding quark masses and that much of the Higgs sector may remain shrouded in mystery for years to come.",,,
846,"The Image of the Author in Poetic Editions of Pope, Robinson, and Byron","Recent studies of authorial celebrity often identify the phenomenon as one that originates in the early nineteenth century and coincides with the industrialization of print and other media. In this study I identify celebrity as a cultural formation that originates earlier, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, and that is coeval with constructions of subjectivity that emerge from the empiricist theories of Locke and the transcendental deductions of Kant. In my analysis, Enlightenment philosophy has ramifications for eighteenth-century visual and print cultures such that, in specific cases, the period's new formation of subjectivity appears in the form of the authorial figure of celebrity-as-genius. I explore this formulation in contemporary collected editions of three poets: Alexander Pope, Mary Robinson, and Lord Byron. These three poets share in a characteristic that sets them apart from other authors of the period, each enjoying an extensive contemporary fame (i.e., celebrity) founded both on visual and textual self-representation. Using a methodology that draws upon an array of eighteenth-century theorists of painting (Jonathan Richardson, William Hogarth, and Joshua Reynolds), contemporary literary critics and philosophers (Phillipe Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy, Jacques Derrida, Charles Taylor), and approaches (book history, visual culture, bibliography, biography), I explore the material properties of specific poetic editions of these poets, considering how in their books Enlightenment subjectivity emerges in terms of a contradictory mix of fashionable contemporary celebrity with timeless genius. This dichotomy points to an antinomy running through Western thought, the conflict between perceptual and abstract, particular and general, fashionably ornamental and classically grand. In my analysis, this antinomy---and the new Enlightenment notion of the subject itself as a rational, autonomous individual---is evident in the visual, material, and textual properties of these books as a troubled and conflicted hybrid of celebrity and genius. Features of this dissertation include: close bibliographical analyses of early editions of the poets' books in parallel with detailed readings of frontispiece portraits and key poetic texts; examination of biographical episodes in the poets' lives in relation to material properties of their books; an afterword that considers eighteenth-century celebrity in light of current neuroscience of vision.",,,
847,"Trustworthy Decentralized Publication, Search and Retrieval in Heterogeneous Networks","As ubiquitous networked devices continue to play an increased role in the daily lives of most people, there is a growing desire to share ever more information among friends and acquaintances. Traditional centralized search engines, such as those of Google, Yahoo! and Bing, allow simple and efficient searching for publicly available information; however, there is no similar service or method that enables people to share personal information directly and easily in a distributed and decentralized manner. Furthermore, the dissemination of information in centralized networks can be subverted or restricted by governments or corporations if the information is deemed undesirable. To address this need, we present a trustworthy decentralized publication, search and retrieval system, named iTrust. The iTrust network may be accessed using a variety of devices from traditional computer desktops with wired networking to mobile ad-hoc wireless devices, such as mobile phones and tablets. In this dissertation, we describe the functionality and architecture of the iTrust system including: the generation and distribution of metadata that describes information, the distribution and relaying of queries, the information retrieval process and the probabilistic method of distributing messages. We analyze the performance of the iTrust network over heterogeneous networks, including HTTP, SMS and Wi-Fi Direct. Where relevant, we discuss the novel methods developed to address specific network challenges such as mobile ad-hoc message routing, peer-to-peer network management, message size constraints, etc. Finally, we show how our research contributes both to the fields of computer networking and distributed systems, and also censorship-free sharing of information.",,,
848,Nanomaterial Photosensitizers. Developing Nitric Oxide Delivery Platforms,"Nitric oxide (NO) is an important mammalian bioregulator involved in various physiological processes, such as blood pressure regulation, immune response, and apoptosis. Therefore, the use of NO releasing molecules has potential therapeutic application. Our group has focused on photochemical NO releasing molecules because they can offer spacial, temporal, and dosage control through modulation of the light source. To this end, the following thesis addresses efforts to improve the photosensitization of these compounds by exploiting the novel physical and optical properties of nanoparticles. Specifically, we synthesized and studied supramolecular constructs where, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) and upconvering nanoparticles (UCNPs) acted as light harvesting antennae capable of photosensitizing nitric oxide release from NO donor molecules. Investigations began with the development of a model system for probing the mechanism by which aqueous solutions of CdSe QDs photosenstized NO release from trans-Cr(cyclam)(ONO)2+ (a photochemical NO donor). Steady state and time resolved QD photoluminescence quenching studies performed on the model system helped elucidate that Forester Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) was the primary mechanism of sensitization, and a model was developed to provide general guidelines for other QD-sensitized applications. Next, UCNPs (composed of NaYF4 doped with rare earth ions) were investigated as photosensitizers due to their unique ability to efficiently generate visible emission through sequential absorption of multiple near infrared photons (which have deep tissue penetration). UCNPs and Roussin's Black Salt [Fe4S 3(NO)7+], (a photochemical NO donor) were encapsulation within a polymer, and investigated as a potential photochemical NO delivery implant. The polymer-UCNP constructs reproducibly generated high concentrations of NO from Roussin's Black Salt upon near infrared excitation, thereby providing a proof of concept for solid state NO delivery methods. Other findings discussed herein include, the synthesis and investigation of zinc-based QDs as biocompatible photosensitizers, as well as QD catalyzed surface ligand decomposition. In the case of the latter, CdSe QDs were found to photo-catalytically sensitize the oxidation of 1,1-dithiooxalate (DTO) resulting in the release of carbon disulfide (a potential mammalian bioregulatory molecule). Preliminary data suggests that DTO-type surface ligands may have potential as generic photo-cleavable anchors for the selective delivery of QD-appended target molecules.",,,
850,Non-semisimple Generalizations of Turaev-Viro TQFTs and Their Lattice Model Realizations,"This dissertation investigates the non-semisimple generalization of Turaev-Viro topological quantum field theories and their lattice model realizations. The goal is to find a categorical framework that generalizes the spherical fusion category theory for the semisimple case. Our approach is to start with the dual picture of categorical framework. By a theorem of Ostrik, every fusion category is the representation category of a certain quantum groupoid. So we work with non-semisimple quantum groupoids. The dissertation consists of three parts which consider different aspects of our goal. In the first part, we provide details of a proof for Kerler's conjecture about the structure of modular group representation on the centers of small quantum groups uqsl(2). In the second part, we study Kuperberg invariants and Hennings invariants for 3-manifolds which are non-semisimple generalizations of Turaev-Viro invariants and Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants. We show that for Lens spaces they satisfy a relation similar to that between Turaev-Viro invariants and Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants. In the third part, we establish a generalization of Kitaev models from unitary quantum groupoids. Then we show that based on a Kitaev-Kong quantum groupoid HC , the ground state manifold of the generalized model is canonical isomorphic to that of the Levin-Wen model based on the unitary fusion category C Therefore the generalized Kitaev models provide realizations of the target space of the Turaev-Viro TQFT based on C.",,,
851,Chaperone Interactions in the Endoplasmic Reticulum of Yeast,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle most often associated with protein folding, translocation, degradation, and protein maturation. The chaperone protein BiP is a resident protein of the ER in budding yeast (S. cerevisiae); it returns the cell to homeostasis following stress such as heat, lack of nutrients, or an imbalance in pH. ER stress leads proteins to unfold or misfold and aggregate, a toxic phenomenon that is implicated in such diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. In order to explore BiP's roles in the ER, we have developed a spatial model of translocation, in which BiP transports nascent proteins through the ER membrane into the aqueous ER lumen, with the assistance of the co-chaperone Sec63. When Sec63 is on the membrane, it recruits BiP and facilitates translocation. Thus spatial localization and function are linked at the ER membrane, and the distribution of BiP is heterogeneous in the ER. We have used fluorescence data, captured by collaborator Carissa Young, to determine the molecular heterogeneity of BiP. Employing a method called Number and Brightness (N&B;), we determined the degree of BiP clustering on unfolded proteins. Stress was induced on one group of cells, while the control cells were not stressed. We found that in the stressed case, BiP molecules were clustered to a much larger extent than in the unstressed case. To better understand the potential advantages of BiP clustering, we have created a model that encompasses the functions of BiP in the ER. We found that the clustering facilitated increased protein folding efficiency as well as decreased utilization of chaperones.",,,
852,The Cognitive Benefits of Learning by Teaching and Teaching Expectancy,"Four experiments sought to disentangle the relative benefits of teaching expectancy (i.e., preparing to teach) and actually teaching (i.e., explaining to others) on learning. Participants studied a paper-based multimedia lesson on the Doppler Effect with the expectation of teaching or being tested on the material; some participants actually taught the material (by providing a video-recorded lecture), whereas others only studied the lesson. Participants then completed a comprehension test either immediately or following a one-week delay. Results indicated that when tested immediately (Experiments 1 and 3), those who prepared to teach outperformed those who prepared to be tested (i.e., a teaching expectancy effect; Experiment 1: d = .59; Experiment 3: d = .55); further, the act of teaching did not improve learning beyond preparing to teach. However, when tested following a one-week delay (Experiments 2 and 4), participants who actually taught the material outperformed those who only prepared to teach (i.e., a teaching effect; Experiment 2: d = .79; Experiment 4: d = .90), and the teaching expectancy effect was eliminated. Overall, these findings suggest that preparing to teach helped students better manage essential processing (i.e., processing related to initially representing the material), which may result in short-term benefits, whereas actually teaching fostered deeper generative processing (i.e., processing related to making sense out of the material), which is critical for achieving long-term learning.",,,
853,"'Success is Surviving': Poverty, Culture, and Urban Project Survival","Few studies examine women and youths' experiences living in housing projects. Even fewer studies examine residents' various interlocking struggles or document their strategies for survival in these spaces. My dissertation examines how women and youth are not isolated from the social consequences of deindustrialization, the concentration of urban poverty, racial segregation, gangs, drugs, or violence that surround their community. I analyze how housing project residents utilize and generate culture to make sense of their daily lives; to negotiate project poverty, criminalization, and violence; and ultimately, to survive in their urban environment. In order to understand the processes and conditions of urban project survival, I combine the methods of critical criminology, poverty studies, and justice studies with urban ethnography. Over a two-year period (January 2009 -- June 2011), I employ multiple qualitative research methods including archival research, participant-observation, online networking, shadowing, conceptual community mapping, interviews, and focus groups. My analysis reveals the housing projects as a structurally disadvantaged, criminalized, and violent space, as well as a site of survival, consciousness, and resistance. It exposes poverty, criminalization, and violence as interactional processes that are simultaneously contested and reproduced in the housing projects. This research has potential for improving the lives of many residents and influencing effective policy.",,,
854,A Defense of Millian Descriptivism,"Taken together with other plausible theses, Millianism has the counterintuitive consequence that the following belief reports have the same semantic content. (1a) Lois Lane believes that Superman is brave. (1b) Lois Lane believes that Clark Kent is brave. It has been popular, at least since the publication of Salmon's Frege's Puzzle (1986), to explain the presence of anti-Millian intuitions in terms of pragmatic phenomena. According to Salmon's account, (1a) and (1b) can be used to communicate distinct propositions, and this leads to the mistaken conclusion that (1a) and (1b) differ in semantic content. Since the publication of Soames's Beyond Rigidity (2002) and Thau's Consciousness and Cognition (2002), it has been popular to say that (1a) and (1b) can be used to communicate descriptive propositions. These propositions may be distinct, and this contributes to the mistaken conclusion that (1a) and (1b) differ in semantic content. In this essay, I elaborate and defend a modified version of Salmon's account. This new account incorporates elements from Soames and Thau, so it can be regarded as a synthesis of previous accounts. It is argued that the new account is superior in various respects, not the least of which is its ability to handle various puzzles and problematic cases. Because of the elements that are incorporated from Soames and Thau, the new account can be regarded as an example of Millian Descriptivism.. After explaining and motivating Salmon's account, I consider several problems. I then propose the new account as an attractive way of avoiding these problems. It is noted that there are several similarities between the new account and the accounts offered by Soames and Thau, but it is argued that the new account is superior in maintaining certain elements of Salmon's original account. I conclude by defending the new account against Caplan's (2007) recent attack on Millian Descriptivism. Among other things, I argue that the new account is not susceptible to the objections that have been standardly raised against Fregean Descriptivism.",,,
855,Tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) and Desert Riparian Ecosystem Change,"Exotic plant invasions commonly increase wildfire frequency and intensity. While extensive research has examined relationships between plant invasion and fire regimes in upland systems, few studies have investigated these relationships in riparian ecosystems. In this dissertation, I investigate the mechanisms underlying increases in riparian wildfire associated with the replacement of native cottonwood-willow (Salix and Populus spp.) forests by invasive tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) in desert riparian ecosystems in the southwestern U.S. Several experiments answer the question: what is the role of Tamarix in altering wildfire dynamics in riparian systems? The superior post-fire recovery of Tamarix observed by numerous investigators suggests a positive feedback cycle where repeated fires exclude native riparian species and promote Tamarix. The results of a regional analysis showed fire to be more common and likely to spread through the riparian corridor where Tamarix occurred. Ignitability experiments showed that Tamarix foliage is more flammable than native foliage. A survey of 30 riparian burns showed that native mortality increased with Tamarix cover. Therefore, a positive feedback between Tamarix and fire excludes native vegetation because Tamarix promotes fire and exhibits higher post-fire recovery than natives. Because fire intensity is a common mechanism driving positive feedbacks between invasive species and fire, prescribed burns were conducted at two sites (Great Basin 2006 and Mojave 2008) to determine the relationship between Tamarix vegetation architecture and fire intensity. Fire intensity was positively related to Tamarix cover and biomass, thus greater native mortality in denser Tamarix is caused by higher fire intensity.",,,
856,"Performing Politics: Visibility, Identity, and Meaning-Making in Docudrama","My dissertation, Performing Politics: Visibility, Identity, and Meaning-Making in Docudrama, challenges scholars' privileging of documentary theatre, which relies solely on primary source material such as trial transcripts, over docudrama, which allows a blending of primary sources with fiction. I focus on contemporary docudrama theatre practitioners in the United States, and specifically on productions that address issues of gender and sexuality. My work argues for the feminist potential of docudrama to disrupt hierarchies of knowledge and destabilize the primacy of the primary source. I demonstrate in Chapter One that in a docudrama like Paula Kamen's Jane: Abortion and the Underground, ""reality"" operates alongside the imaginative potential of fiction, thus providing practitioners and audiences a unique realm in which to tackle difficult and politically charged issues. My second chapter argues that the interdisciplinarity of documentary theatre can be a feminist ethnographic model for scholar-artists to employ ethical research methods for artistic engagement. Through a critical examination of E. Patrick Johnson's Sweet Tea, I argue that reflexivity and the post-show talkback are promising tools for foregrounding the practitioner's positionality and raising public consciousness. Finally, I challenge implications that documentary theatre is inherently pedagogical. Through an analysis of Dustin Lance Black's 8, I question the ways in which parroting primary source material reifies dominant ideologies, further entrenching cultural hierarchies. I conclude by considering other promising feminist attributes of docudrama, specifically the symbiotic potential of dialoging documentary scholarship with scholarship on queer temporalities.",,,
858,Variational Methods in Potential Theory and Planar Elliptic Growth,"A nested family of growing or shrinking planar domains is called a Laplacian growth process if the normal velocity of each domain's boundary is propor- tional to the gradient of the domain's Green function with a fixed singularity on the interior. In this dissertation we consider a generalization to so-called elliptic growth, wherein the Green function is replaced with that of a more general elliptic operator, which models inhomogeneities in the underlying plane. Of particular interest is the way that elliptic growth extends Laplacian growth. As such, we consider elliptic operators that are somehow close to the Laplacian and derive perturbative formulas for the Green function; with these we discuss a couple of inverse problems which seek to locally characterize the newly enlarged phase space.",,,
859,Interactions between the morphosyntax and prosody of switch-reference in Hua narrative discourse,"In its traditional definition, switch-reference refers to systems where subject co-reference and disjoint reference across clause boundaries are marked. Found in a wide variety of languages, it is especially prevalent in languages of the Trans-New Guinea family. A closer look at switch-reference constructions in connected speech suggests that the traditional understanding of the primary function of switch-reference might not be accurate. In this study, I rely on data from four traditional Hua folk tales which total approximately thirty minutes. I focus on instances of unexpected switch-reference marking in order to elucidate what principles underlie the use of so-called aberrant forms. I discuss both the morphosyntactic and prosodic patterning in order to advance the claim that switch-reference is based on particular intraclausal relationships within coordinate clause chains. The morphosyntax of unexpected switch-reference marking involves the interaction between two sets of constructions inherent in the morphology of coordinate medial verbs. One set is used to signal either continuity between the subparts of a single coherent event, or discontinuity between different events. In the other set, a causal interpretation between the actions represented by two clauses is either ruled out or made explicit. The prosodic patterning of these constructions is equally important. Single clauses can occur in separate intonation units when the subparts of an event represent separate actions. Alternatively, both clauses in the construction can occur in a single intonation unit to reflect the cohesiveness of the actions in terms of eventhood. What emerges from these observations is that the primary function of the morphosyntax of switch-reference is to mark dependency relations between coordinate clauses. The prosody of switch-reference interacts with and sometimes reinforces the morphosyntactic coding by signaling different degrees of continuity and discontinuity at various levels in the event structure of discourse. The claim that Hua switch-reference is fundamentally based on the interplay between dependency relations and event structure has far-reaching consequences for our broader understanding of the typology of clause combining, and suggests a need for a closer look at the cross-linguistic interactions between the morphosyntax and prosody of switch-reference.",,,
860,Probing Strongly-Scattered Compact Objects Using Ultra-High-Resolution Techniques in Radio Astronomy,"This dissertation explores fundamental limits in radio astronomy and develops techniques that utilize the scintillation of compact objects to probe detailed properties of their emission regions and of the scattering material. I develop a statistical framework for observations with spectral resolution at or near the Nyquist limit, suitable for describing the observed statistics of strongly-scattered sources. I demonstrate that these statistics can effectively isolate the signature of an extended emission region, requiring no assumptions about the nature or distribution of the scattering material. Then, using observations of the Vela pulsar at 760 MHz with the Green Bank Telescope, I thereby achieve a spatial resolution of 4 km at the pulsar. Finally, I explore the signature of refractive scintillation on the interferometric visibility measured on long baselines, and I derive optimal correlation estimators for quantized data.",,,
861,The Flavor Problem from Strings to the LHC,"The problem of mass hierarchies has remained one of the most persistent open questions in elementary particle physics. The author's contributions to this problem, detailed in this thesis, consist of addressing the appearance of low-scale axions in string-implemented models of flavor hierarchies, and of using the flavor hierarchies present in natural supersymmetry to develop methods for studying properties of the standard-model-like Higgs boson at the LHC. We find string-motivated models of mass hierarchies which have safe QCD axions at low scales arising from a combination of the Green-Schwarz and Froggatt-Nielsen mechanisms. Supersymmetric extensions of these setups can lead to scenarios of `natural' supersymmetry, where the sparticles which have the largest couplings to the Higgs are the lightest. This leads us to exploit this feature in studying properties of the Higgs at the LHC. We find that it can be reconstructed as a resonance in the bottom dijet channel, and measurements of its branching ratios can be made with minimal backgrounds.",,,
862,Performing Religious Parody in Plautine Comedy,"This dissertation examines the relationship between theatrical and religious performances at Rome as evident in the comedies of the early second century BCE playwright Titus Maccius Plautus. Though these comedies were performed at festivals to the gods, it is frequently maintained that there was no connection between the content of Roman comedy and its religious context. I, however, argue that parody is the key to understanding the link between these two seemingly disparate types of social performance and that it is necessary to recognize this connection in order to appreciate how these plays fit within their cultural context. Much of the work done on parody over the last century focuses on the way in which one text can imitate and comment on another, but since Plautus' audience experienced his plays as performances rather than as texts, I look for models of Plautine parody among the various religious performances that would have been on display at the same festivals at which the plays themselves were staged. The religious parodies in Plautine comedy engage with and critique many of the noteworthy religious practices of the day, including the strict monitoring of prayer language and ritual action, the regulation of worshipers according to class and gender, and the importation of foreign cults into the Roman system of worship. After an introduction, the three following chapters will focus on one play each from the Plautine corpus---Aulularia, Rudens, and Poenulus---each chosen because of some special relationship to the world of Roman cult. The set of Aulularia features a shrine to the abstract quality Fides, which allows for parody of the political use of such cults in the third century BCE, while Rudens and Poenulus both depict the worship of Venus, providing a parodic image of the importation of the cult of Venus Erycina from Sicily. In each instance, Plautus uses parody to draw attention to the rigidity within the system of Roman worship while simultaneously engendering reflection on the audience's own cultural practices at a time when the ascendant power of Rome was defining itself in relation to other cultures throughout the Mediterranean.",,,
864,Children Exposed to Domestic Violence: Examining the Role of Group Cohesion in a Group Intervention,"Group treatment has long been considered a particularly beneficial modality for children who have experienced interpersonal trauma due to the many benefits it affords (Silvosky, 2005) and is one of the most common forms of treatment for children exposed to domestic violence (Graham-Bermann & Hughes, 2003). Although the intervention studies examining group therapy outcomes for children exposed to domestic violence show promising results (Rizo, Macy, Ermentrout, & Johns, 2011), research on therapeutic factors have failed to be considered for investigation in the previous research conducted for this population (Graham-Bermann, Lynch, Banyard, DeVoe, & Halabu, 2007). Although there is a dearth of research on the mechanisms of change involved in children's groups, some researchers have found group cohesion to be among the most helpful features (Shechtman & Mor, 2010) and predictive of child outcomes (i.e., social competence, anxiety). By utilizing a mixed-methods design, the current exploratory pilot study sought to investigate the relationship between group cohesion and group therapy outcomes and the ways in which group cohesion is manifested in group treatment for Latino children exposed to domestic violence. Participants included 36, primarily Latino children (95%), ages 8-13, who participated in a community-based group therapy program for families exposed to domestic violence. In addition to collecting pre- and postgroup questionnaires related to their mental health, coping, and group engagement, 14 children also participated in semistructured interviews. Ethnographic observations of the groups were also utilized. The results suggested that children's level perceived group cohesion is significantly related to decreases in total difficulties, but was not significantly related to coping behaviors following the group intervention. The mixed-methods findings suggest that group cohesion may be both related to and manifested by children sharing in group. Cultural considerations, clinical implications and directions for future research are discussed.",,,
865,"Analyzing Cultural Reimaginations and Global Chinese Power in CCTV's ""The Legend of Bruce Lee""","Bruce Lee is a martial arts action star whose enduring screen image has lasted many decades beyond his death, and this is partially due to the numerous clones that came out after the star's premature death in 1973. These clones and various spin-offs of Lee's life's works resulted in the phenomenon dubbed ""Bruceploitation."" As time passed, the Bruceploitation phenomenon slowed down, but more recently there has been an interest in Bruce Lee's life with various films and television series that attempt to tell the life story of the actor, especially with his family's involvement. While earlier forms of Bruceploitation films strove to exploit Lee's image for financial profits, these more recent works do not seem to exploit Lee in the same way. In particular, Bruceploitation in more recent works aims to exploit the martial arts star's narrative to associate his persona with specific ideologies. I argue, however, that the more recent television series by China Central Television, The Legend of Bruce Lee, is in fact following in the legacy of Bruceploitation in that this category of texts is not only about making money without the consent of the star, but it is rooted in the act of exploitation, which redefined the image of Bruce Lee in a national Chinese context. Although the CCTV series may not look for financial profits as its main goal through the perpetuation of Lee's narrative, it is exploiting his image for ideological purposes. In particular, the series exploits Lee's image to assert national Chinese power in a global context, which can be seen through the production practices, circulation of the series, and the construction of specific scenes throughout the series.",,,
866,Tracking Tethered Kite via Kalman Filter and Sensor Fusion,"One of the keys to reducing the world dependence on fossil fuels and the emissions of greenhouse gases is the use of a suitable combination of alternative and green energy sources. In the area of wind energy, recent studies showed that there is enough potential in the total world wind power to sustain the global needs. A new class of generators denoted as HAWP (High Altitude Wind Power) has emerged recently, which exploits the aerodynamic forces generated by the flight of tethered kite to produce electric energy. The key to capture wind energy through flying tethered kite is the ability to track and control the kite to fly in a ""figure-eight"" pattern. Thus, an accurate reconstruction of the kite position, velocity and heading is of fundamental importance for the automatic control of the kite in the ""figure-eight"" pattern. This thesis presents an approach to track a tethered kite through the Kalman filter and fusing multiple available sensors. Two different sensor setups and the related sensor fusion algorithms are considered and implemented in real-time. The first sensor setup imply the use of a commercial Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), installed on the kite and equipped with accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, GPS, and a barometer. The first approach uses a standard linear observer, while the second one introduces a nonlinear correction to account for the specific kinematic constraints of the considered application. In the second sensor setup, we consider the use of a line angle measurement system in addition to the accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers. Lastly, the results of experimental tests carried out with a small-scale prototype capable of flying a kite at a low height is presented and analyzed.",,,
867,"The Brazen Walles of this Kingdome: The History of the First Year of the English Parliamentary Navy, 1642--1643","Histories tracing the evolution of the modern British navy nearly all begin their examinations of the fleet during the Cromwellian Protectorate or early restoration England of the mid-to-late seventeenth century. While such studies abound, few recognize the fundamental importance of the growth and restructuring of the navy during the English Civil Wars, beginning in 1642. In my study of the first year of the parliamentary navy I argue that the origin of the modern British Navy should be traced back a decade before the Protectorate to the civil war fleet and the first navy to be run by parliament rather than the king. Understanding that the men and vessels of the civil war navy are integral and overlooked progenitors to the fleets that followed them also highlights the importance of that navy to the origins and early military campaigns of the English Civil War. By more fully recognizing the centrality of debates surrounding the navy and how the successes and stresses of the fleet shaped the conflict between King Charles I and parliament in 1642-3 this dissertation connects the fleet back to other important wartime events in England and on the continent instead of examining it in the maritime vacuum in which it is so often considered. By integrating the civil war navy's history into the social, political, military and economic context of the English Civil War, my work shows how the context in which the civil war navy was funded and operated created a fleet that linked the Caroline and Protectorate navy. Furthermore, examining the war's evolution in the context of events related to the navy---instead of the other way around---I provide an additional angle to complement existing studies that consider why the war developed in the specific way it did through the summer of 1643.",,,
868,"Prescription for a Nation: Public Health in Post-Revolutionary Bolivia, 1952--1964","This dissertation examines the extension of public health programs into the countryside following the 1952 Bolivian National Revolution, which put the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (National Revolutionary Movement, MNR) into power. Historical studies of the Bolivian Revolution have focused on its political and economic agenda, mainly agrarian reform, nationalization of the mining industry, and granting of universal suffrage to formerly disenfranchised populations. However, public health was as important to the revolutionary government's plan for political, economic, and cultural consolidation as these well-explored topics. Though public health programs focused on maternal and infant health, vaccinations, and disease control projects, I argue they were designed to consolidate and institutionalize the revolution, boost a faltering economy, and foster revolutionary nationalism. Public health provides a lens for a cultural analysis of the MNR's political, economic, and social agenda and reveals the gender and racial dynamics of the revolutionary state formation process. Health campaigns in Bolivia in the 1950s and 1960s were linked to hierarchies of gender, race, and citizenship; the MNR thought public health programs would eradicate a perceived impediment to Bolivia's progress by transforming rural living conditions, linking indigenous communities to the national government, and producing a healthy citizenry and workforce. Local, national, and international levels of analysis provide a multifaceted understanding of the negotiation of health, citizenship, and identity during the revolutionary period and show that health campaigns were created and contested in multiple political and cultural arenas. Internationally, the MNR relied on funding and personnel from the United States and incorporated international public health rhetoric into its own campaigns. At the national level, government officials and doctors conjoined revolutionary rhetoric and public health programs. Local communities articulated their own version of this rhetoric to demand the government fulfill its revolutionary promises by providing health services. Therefore, public health provides a framework for examining social relations, identity formation, and the contestation of power in modern Bolivia.",,,
870,The Back Door: Institutional Change in the California Legislature,"In the worst recession since the great depression, California's historic leadership of innovation and investment was replaced with budget reductions and the elimination of services and programs. What emerged in 2008 was the implementation of Budget Stakeholder Workgroups (BSWs) by the California Legislature, a process that is still used today. The BSW phenomena is conceived of as an alternative budgetary process that grants non-traditional stakeholders such as service recipients a seat at the table of California's budgetary decision-making process. The inclusion of non-traditional stakeholders is occurring at the same time that BSWs have become the venue to develop and implement large department reductions, specifically in the Health and Human Services arena. This study considers the historical evolution of California's BSWs through the Health and Human Services budgetary process and their impact on the institution. Expanding the field of institutional change, through interviews with administrators, legislative staff and members, lobbyist and advocates, this study addresses the issue of institutional change within a public bureaucratic institution. Unlike new institutionalism, this study demonstrates that institutional change is a process beyond conformity and acknowledges the agency of individuals. This study also documents gradual institutional change and extends sociological understandings of bureaucratic institutions as a positive process.",,,
871,"How Far Is Beijing? Gender and the Capital in Tie Ning's How Far Is Forever and ""Night of the Spring Breeze""","China's urbanization has led to new urban identities and urban fiction. Amidst these trends, Chairwoman of the Chinese Writers' Association Tie Ning has developed a body of fiction that paints a rich portrait of Beijing and the women who live there. However, little English-language scholarship on her works exists; this study is a first step towards filling that gap. It focuses on How Long Is Forever and ""Night of the Spring Breeze,"" in which the city of Beijing becomes a character in itself. These stories span from the 1970s to today and include female characters in various socioeconomic positions, acting as a microcosm of Beijing society. In these works, the geography, architecture, aesthetic, and culture of Beijing contribute to the development of female characters' identities. Through analyzing these interactions, this paper seeks to understand Tie Ning's Beijing and how it has changed over the past forty years.",,,
872,"Single-molecule elasticity of single-stranded DNA, a model flexible polyelectrolyte","Understanding the structure of unfolded, flexible polyelectrolytes is important for our comprehension of basic processes in molecular biology (e.g., RNA and protein folding) and our ability to exploit the polymers in technology (e.g., in self-assembled nanostructures). Here, we investigate the structure of single single-stranded DNA molecules and their interactions with ions using magnetic tweezers. Our data reveal that single-stranded DNA is not well-described by ideal polymer models such as the Worm-Like Chain. At low force, we report the first experimental observation of a nonlinear elastic regime revealing the relevance of long-range excluded volume effects. At high force, the extension scales as a logarithm in monovalent salt. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that this logarithmic regime is the result of ion-stabilized wrinkles at short-length scales along the polymer backbone. Addition of divalent salt to the buffer results in enhanced elasticity indicating increased wrinkling or polymer ''wrapping"" around the divalent ions. Using a thermodynamic identity, we are able to count ions as they are released into the bulk upon polymer elongation. We find that ssDNA releases significantly more ions than dsDNA. We posit that the recently termed ''Snake-Like Chain"" model (Ullner, J. Phys. Chem B (2003)) for flexible polyelectrolytes may explain these observations. As a first step towards characterizing biologically relevant nucleic acid structures, we measure the effects of base-stacking on ssDNA elasticity. We find that base-stacking in poly(dA) significantly enhances the rigidity of the polymer as evidenced by the low-force elasticity. The unstacking transition of poly(dA) at high force reveals that the intrinsic electrostatic tension on the molecule varies significantly more weakly on salt concentration than predictions from mean-field models. Further, we provide a model-independent estimate of the free energy difference between stacked and unstacked nucleic acids, finding it to be roughly -0.25 kT/base and nearly constant over three orders of magnitude in salt concentration.",,,
873,From Si Se Puede to Echale Ganas: Transforming the Life Narrative of Migrant Students through Debate Tournaments,"This dissertation theorizes that contemporary migrant students who participate in Migrant Education debate tournaments develop a new and specific life narrative that is much more focused than the positive success narratives historically presented by participants in the Migrant Education Program. The data of this ethnographic study were collected over two years of regional and state Migrant Education debate tournaments. More than 50 hours of video records of debates, interviews, and setting shots were collected and analyzed using content analysis and constant comparative method. Data were coded for themes of social justice, literacies, and situated learning. The findings in this study focus on how students learn and what they learn in the debate tournaments. The findings of how students learned through the Migrant Education debates reveal that participants learn through apprentice relationships with peers and adults, through overcoming fear by participating in the debate tournaments' required acts of public speaking, and through their personal evolution as members in a community of practice. The findings of what is afforded to students in the debates as learning opportunities revealed that participants learned civic skills of a democratic society, oral and written literacies practiced in debates, and the valorization of bilingualism. Within these findings, a new migrant narrative and a new motivational slogan emerged. These new narrative sequences highlight the specificity of literacy development in the Migrant Education debate tournaments. Based on these findings and the articulation of a new migrant narrative, it is hoped that this study will contribute to a greater understanding of the functions of the Migrant Education debate tournaments. Furthermore, it is hoped that the findings from this study will be used in future determinations of state and federal support for the Migrant Education Program in general and for the Migrant Education debate tournaments specifically.",,,
874,Gate Last Indium-Gallium-Arsenide MOSFETs with Regrown Source-Drain Regions and ALD Dielectrics,"III-V-based MOSFETs have the potential to exceed the performance of silicon-based MOSFETs due to the semiconductor's small electron effective mass. Modern silicon-based MOSFETs with 22 nm gate lengths utilize high-k gate insulators and non-planar device geometries to optimize device performance. III-V HEMT technology has achieved similar gate lengths, but large source-drain access resistances and the lack of high-quality gate insulators prevent further device performance scaling. Sub-22 nm gate length III-V MOSFETs require metal-semiconductor contact resistivity to be less than 1 ohm-micron squared, gate insulators with less than 1 nm effective oxide thickness, and semiconductor-insulator interface trap densities less than 2E12 per square centimeter per electron volt. This dissertation presents InGaAs-based III-V MOSFET process flows and device results to assess their use in VLSI circuits. Previous III-V MOSFET results focused on long (>100 nm) gate lengths and ion implantation for source-drain region formation. Scaling III-V MOSFETs to shorter gate lengths requires source-drain regions that have low sheet resistance, high mobile charge densities, and low metal-semiconductor contact resistance. MBE- and MOCVD-based raised epitaxial source-drain regrowth meet these requirements. MBE InAs source-drain regrowth samples have shown 0.5 to 2 ohm-micron squared metal semiconductor contact resistivities. MOCVD InGaAs source-drain regrowth samples have shown < 100 ohm-micron single-sided access resistance to InGaAs MOSFETs. Gate insulators on III-V materials require large conduction band offsets to the channel, high dielectric permittivities, and low semiconductor-insulator interface trap densities. An in-situ hydrogen plasma / trimethylaluminum treatment has been developed to lower the gate semiconductor-insulator interface trap density. This treatment, done immediately before gate insulator deposition, has been shown to lower MOS capacitor interface trap densities by more than a factor of two. Devices using gate-first MBE regrowth, gate-last MBE regrowth, and gate-last MOCVD regrowth were fabricated and resulting devices characterized. 65 nm gate length gate-first MBE regrowth devices employing a 2.2 nm EOT Al 2O3 gate insulator show peak transconductances of 0.3 mS/micron at 1 V Vds. Gate-first FET performance scaling is limited by processed-induced damage and ungated access regions. 64 nm gate length gate-last MBE regrowth devices employing a 1.21 nm EOT Al2O 3 / HfO2 bi-layer gate insulator show peak transconductances of 1.4 mS/micron at 0.5 V Vds. Other gate-last MBE samples had long channel subthreshold swings as low as 117 mV/dec. 48 nm gate length gate-last MOCVD MOSFETs employing a 0.8 nm EOT HfO2 gate insulator and digital channel etching show peak transconductances of 2 mS/micron at 0.5 V Vds, with long channel devices having 97 mV/dec subthreshold swing.",,,
875,Reframing a Pandemic: HIV/AIDS and Conservative Evangelical Discourse in the United States,"This dissertation is a study of conservative white evangelical discourse on HIV/AIDS. Specifically, I look to the continuities and changes in evangelical rhetoric about the disease since the early 1980s, and the ways that race, gender, sexuality, class, and nation intersect and are utilized in these discourses. I argue that beginning in the late 1990s the baby boomer generation of conservative evangelicals began reframing the culture wars discourse around AIDS, which had controlled evangelical responses to the disease during the 1980s and 1990s. This paradigm constructed HIV/AIDS as a disease that was a problem for gay men (typically white gay men) and drug users as the product of sinful behavior. As a result, this earlier generation frequently denounced public funding to fight the disease and remained disengaged from work to help people with AIDS and battle the epidemic. However, this discourse shifted when the baby boomer generation of conservative evangelicals started taking over leadership of the movement, and they reworked the culture wars framework in order to convince their coreligionists to change their perspectives on HIV/AIDS and become engaged in addressing the disease. This generation has changed the evangelical outlook on and government responses to AIDS in four main ways: acknowledging the potential for missionary activity; presenting the disease as a global (mainly Third World), heterosexual problem; emphasizing the opportunity to teach conservative evangelical sexual standards; and calling attention to ""innocent"" victims of the disease, particularly orphans and some women. In this way, baby boomer evangelicals have maintained underlying commitments to culture wars concerns, especially to heteronormativity, while shifting the larger framework. With a strong emphasis on AIDS in the Third World, the epidemic in the United States has been written largely out of the baby boomer narrative on the disease, despite the continuing devastation it causes here, especially in communities of color. This dissertation contains three chapters. The first chapter is a historical survey of evangelical AIDS discourses and emphasizes both continuity and change over time. The second chapter is a case study of Rick and Kay Warren and their work to reframe the disease. The third chapter is an analysis of the impact of baby boomer evangelicals on U.S. government AIDS policies and funding, both domestic and international.",,,
876,"The Challenge of Orchestral Reductions: A Case Study of Writing a Reduction for Mozart's 5th Violin Concerto, K. 219","The purpose of this document is to develop a process for addressing the various challenges and issues inherent in writing an orchestral reduction for piano, and to create a new score designed to be useful to collaborative pianists in rehearsals and performance, through the case study of writing a new reduction for Mozart's 5th Violin Concerto in A major, K. 219. The methodology includes an overview of the existing literature on orchestral reductions in order to establish an historical continuum and to articulate a recognized approach as to how one writes a reduction for piano. The three subsequent process chapters are dedicated respectively to each of the three movements of the concerto. Each chapter includes an analysis of the orchestral score itself and discusses the reduction of the score, section by section. Excerpts from existing editions are incorporated as appropriate in order to compare and contrast different reduction techniques. Issues that arise during the process are addressed, and solutions are offered to problematic passages based on a set of analytical procedures that involve harmonic, melodic, structural and performance-based considerations. Thus, this document offers a step-by-step process to what can otherwise be a very subjective task. While the technical and aesthetic demands of undertaking the writing of a reduction are many, and the process often subjective, the intention was to create a methodology and develop systematic tools for approaching any reduction in an objective manner. Since music-making always has, and always will be one that involves artistry, creativity, and subjectivity, it is unreasonable to conclude that a definitive, completely un-subjective process could ever be developed. However, the resulting score, created by a collaborative pianist to be used by other collaborative pianists in performance and rehearsals reflects a process mindful of technical, practical and aesthetic concerns that ensures integrity to the original score.",,,
877,"Ecce! Art and Text in Ovid's ""Metamorphoses""","Intertextuality, or reading the allusions in one text to another text, has long been a popular approach in the scholarship on Ovid's Metamorphoses, a Latin poem consisting of a sequence of episodes depicting character transformations. This interpretive method, in which scholars locate textual allusions and discuss their implications, has been very helpful in elucidating how ancient texts can engage with and complicate other texts. Recently, however, scholars have begun to explore an expanding network of intertexts, imagining various forms of literary narrative in conversation with images from the visual arts. After all, not only did readers possess a deep and intimate knowledge of both Greek and Latin literature, but they were also visually informed. This study participates in a larger discussion which argues that images should not be viewed independently from the culture and society which produce them. Although the text does not come with illustrations, and is therefore not explicitly paired with images, Ovid's Metamorphoses nevertheless alludes, in its very narrative, to popular images and works of art. Just as contemporary literature contributes to an understanding of art, so conversely, I suggest, contemporary popular art can enrich a reading (through allusion) of a literary text. I suggest that by reading Ovid's poem with and against these images from his contemporary visual culture, one can open up multiple readings of both text and art.",,,
878,Linear and non-linear microrheology of model lung surfactant monolayers at the air-water interface,"Phospholipids are surface active agents and comprise the major component of cell membranes and of lung surfactant. Here, we are especially interested in lung surfactant (LS), which is found at the air-fluid interface of lung alveoli and lowers the surface tension of lungs so that respiration is possible. In particular, it has been hypothesized that dynamic response properties of surfactant monolayers, such as the viscosity and elasticity, are important for their stability, function, and dynamics. For example, extremely low surface tension in alveoli maintained by lung surfactant monolayers establishes a strong driving force that would tend to drive the LS out of the lung into the upper air ways. High viscosity has been proposed to retard the dynamics of expulsion, and thus it keep in the lung. In this dissertation, we examine the dynamic response properties (e.g. viscosity, elasticity, yield stress) of phospholipid monolayers at the air-water interface, and relate them to deformation dynamics of the surfactant micro-structure. We use interfacial microrheology, fluorescence microscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the dependence of these properties and microstructure on surface pressure, the presence of cholesterol, and the enantiomeric excess. For example, the high surface viscosity at high surface pressure of DPPC film and the relatively high elasticity of DPPC:cholesterol film would resist the surface tension gradient-driven flow of lung surfactant out of the alveoli during exhalation. However, during inhalation, a low viscosity is necessary for the LS to quickly spread to cover the area of the alveolar interface. This dissertation reveals important relationships between dynamics of model lung surfactant monolayers as they deform, and the molecular and micro-structure of the monolayers themselves. This work provides a important step for resolving the role of phospholipid and cholesterol in human lung surfactant and in guiding design of replacement surfactants for clinical use.",,,
879,Experiences of Asian Indian Families with Special Education and Disability-Related Services in America,"The American disability service system is predicated on underlying assumptions and beliefs which are dominant in the majority culture. Consequently, minority families, such as families from India, living in America sometimes experience dissonance with respect to the services provided to their family due to their varying cultural values. As such, it is imperative that professionals are able to provide culturally responsive services which respect the customs and values of each family. It is also necessary that service providers are able to evaluate these families' satisfaction with the services they are receiving. Service Adequacy, Family Professional Partnership, and Family Quality of Life have been found to be valuable service outcomes within families in the majority culture in America. Studies examining whether these constructs are similar with families of Asian Indian descent are necessary in order to assess satisfaction and cultural fit of disability-related services, and to provide the most appropriate support to these families. The purpose of the current study was to examine factors that influenced family satisfaction with service adequacy, family professional partnership, and family quality of life as well as how these variables are interrelated particularly for families of Asian Indian descent living in America. Additionally, this mixed methods study aimed to gain information on which specific features of the disability system are considered to be most valuable or most hindering to families of Asian Indian descent as well as what the perceived barriers are to achieving positive family quality of life. These questions were examined through quantitative and qualitative data collected in two phases. Twenty-five participants responded to a survey providing information on their perspectives relating to special education and disability-related services and ten parents of children who have received special education and/or disability-related services participated in semi-structured interviews in which they were asked to share their experiences and beliefs relating to the services provided and the disability service system in America. Participant interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using methods informed by content analysis. Results of the quantitative analysis revealed that Asian Indian families had generally positive ratings of SA, FPP, and FQOL, with the most satisfaction reported with FPP. Results of multiple regression analyses indicated that child and family-level demographic variables were not predictive of SA, FPP, and FQOL. Among SA, FPP, and FQOL, FPP was found to be a significant predictor of FQOL; however SA was not found as a significant predictor of FQOL. Analysis of the ten parent/caregiver interviews revealed two major themes contributing to the discussion of the most valuable and most hindering aspects of the American disability service system: (a) Parental Involvement, or parental participation in services, parental knowledge and expertise, parents as advocates, and parent education; and (b) Service Provisions, or barriers to and methods of accessing diagnoses and effective services, agency and organizational factors, and navigating the service system. In regards to the perceived barriers to achieving a positive family quality of life, three major themes emerged from analysis of the interview data: (a) Impact on Family, or impact on family members and family life; (b) Cultural Norms, or the impact of culture, acceptance of disability, and access to supports; and (c) Community Resources, or the ways in which parents obtained support. Finally, the appropriateness of FQOL, SA, and FPP in measuring family outcomes with the Asian Indian population was established. Overall, results of the present study provide a significant contribution to the literature as this study represents one of the first attempts at researching Asian Indian family perceptions with the American disability service system. Further, the present research highlights the importance of culturally competent services, and in particular, an understanding of cultural beliefs in regards to the roles of parents in the parent-professional partnership. This study also underscores the need for professionals to act as advocates for both children with special needs and their parents by connecting them to supports and assisting them with making accommodations and adaptations to their family life. Finally, methodological issues with respect to conducting research with the Asian Indian population are discussed.",,,
880,Programmed Cell Death and Cellular Stress: Insights from Caenorhabditis elegans pink-1 and icd-1,"Programmed cell death is a critical process that is necessary to cull damaged cells as well as eliminate unnecessary cells during normal development. Improper regulation of this process can result in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. While developmental cell death involves the death of healthy cells, most programmed cell death eliminates unhealthy cells that are unable to recover from stress. There are various different types of cellular stress that can result in cell death including oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The transparent nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is an ideal model in which to study programmed cell death due to its short life cycle and genetic tractability. The genes controlling cell death were originally discovered in this organism and the pathway is conserved from C. elegans to humans. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that results in progressive loss of motor function. Though the majority of cases are sporadic, a small proportion are due to genetic mutations. One of the proteins involved in familial Parkinson's disease, PINK1, is a mitochondrial serine-threonine kinase that protects mitochondria from oxidative stress and aids in the initiation of mitophagy. Loss of PINK1 function results in increased cell death in humans and Drosophila. In C. elegans PINK-1 instead functions as an activator of programmed cell death. This pro-apoptotic function is due to the N-terminal domain rather than kinase function. The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum results in programmed cell death if the unfolded protein response fails to resolve the stress. In C. elegans loss of ICD-1, the homolog of betaNAC, results in excessive ectopic cell death. Loss of ICD-1 function results in the inappropriate targeting of nascent peptides to the endoplasmic reticulum resulting in misfolded protein stress. The cell death induced is completely dependent on CED-4, the Apaf1 homolog, but is more dependent on both the canonical caspase CED-3 in the early-stage embryos and the non-canonical caspase CSP-1 in late-stage embryos. Under stress calcium can be released by the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm. The calpain CLP-2, a calcium activated protease, is also necessary for late-stage embryonic cell deaths in ICD-1 depleted animals.",,,
881,"The Culture of Collaboration: The resilience of the peasantry in San Pablo Coatlan, Oaxaca, Mexico","Despite predictions they would disappear, peasants have been resilient. I argue that this resilience warrants renewed anthropological attention. In 2009, I conducted participant-observation research in a peasant community, San Pablo Coatlan, Oaxaca, Mexico. During my fieldwork the community was torn between a powerful minority who sought to bring ""modernization"" by reorganizing the political structure and privatizing the land and the majority who supported the traditional political structure and communal land. This political conflict provided an excellent opportunity to understand the resilience of the peasantry. I define peasants as those who have the ability to practice subsistence farming, but do not have the ability to accumulate wealth. I argue that the resilience of the peasantry is largely a result of two factors: liminal livelihoods, and social capital. First, peasant livelihoods are liminal: they are at the edge of subsistence production, market production, and wage labor. Peasants are not an intermediate stage between ""primitive"" and ""modern"", their livelihoods are active strategies to combine available opportunities. Peasants' ability to practice subsistence farming provides a productive use for household labor. This ability is important even for those who are dedicated entirely to wage labor because the ability to return to subsistence farming is a form of insurance. The second factor which contributes to the resilience of the peasantry is social capital. Peasants can rely on the support of their fellow community members. In San Pablo, people use unpaid cooperative labor for farming and home construction. I show that much of the farming would not be possible if farmers had to hire workers when they needed additional hands. I explore the various motives to collaborate in private production and in public life. I argue that there are several instrumental motives to participate: direct rewards, reciprocity, and prestige. There are also several consummatory motives: enjoyment, value introjection, and bounded solidarity. I organize these motives into a framework to understand participation that connects the motives to material, structural, and ideological factors within the community. In the conclusion, I argue that this framework has applicability beyond peasant communities to better understand the motives to contribute to the common good.",,,
882,On two-layer analytical models for gravity currents and internal bores,"Internal bores, or internal hydraulic jumps, arise in many atmospheric and oceanographic phenomena. The classic single-layer hydraulic jump model accurately predicts the bore height and propagation velocity when the difference between the densities of the expanding and contracting layers is large (i.e., water and air), but fails in the Boussinesq limit. A two-layer model, which conserves mass separately in each layer and momentum globally is more accurate in the Boussinesq limit, but it requires a fourth jump condition for closure--- typically an assumption about the loss of energy across a bore. It is widely believed that bounds on the bore speed can be found by restricting the energy loss entirely to one of the two layers, but under some circumstances, both bounds over-predict the propagation speed. A front velocity slower than both bounds implies that, somehow, the expanding layer is gaining energy. We directly examine the flux of energy within internal bores using two- and three-dimensional direct numerical simulations and find that although there is a global loss of energy across a bore, a transfer of energy from the contracting to the expanding layer causes a net energy gain in the expanding layer. For Boussinesq bores, the energy transfer is largely the result of turbulent mixing at the interface. For non-Boussinesq flows, undular waves generated at the bore's front may dominate over the effects of turbulent mixing, and the expanding layer loses energy across the bore. Based on these results, we propose improved two-layer models that provides accurate propagation velocities as function of the geometrical parameters, the Reynolds number, and the Schmidt number. We also propose a new model for internal bores, as well as gravity currents (a related flow) on the basis of mass and momentum conservation alone, without the need for considering energy. This is accomplished by combining the streamwise and vertical momentum equations to obtain a vorticity relation that no longer involves pressure. Hence, this vorticity equation, in combination with the conservation of mass, is sufficient for evaluating the bore velocity. The energy loss across the bore can then be predicted by the streamwise energy equation and compared to the assumptions underlying earlier models. The flux of vorticity across an internal bore predicted by this new model is seen to be in close agreement with direct numerical simulation results. Any discrepancies with experimentally measured bore velocities are shown to be due to the effects of downstream mixing.",,,
883,"The ""Music of Buenos Aires"": Exploring Contemporary Tango Music from a Performer's Perspective","It is an exciting time for tango in Argentina as the art form is now undergoing revitalization in the twenty-first century. Tangueros, or tango musicians and composers, are maintaining the traditions of their heritage while also exploring new ways to conceive of the art form. Unfortunately, popular views of tango in the United States often limit the art form to vignettes from Dancing with the Stars or the music of Astor Piazzolla. With this document, I seek to introduce North American scholars and musicians to the new, vibrant tango music being created today in Argentina or what tangueros are calling the ""Music of Buenos Aires."". This document is based on my first-hand experience in Argentina during the South American winters of 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2012 with Argentine tangueros and this music. I focus on three tangueros who are currently composing and performing in Buenos Aires today, namely violinist Damian Bolotin (b. 1965), pianist Sonia Possetti (b. 1973), and bassist Juan Pablo Navarro (b. 1971). I provide brief biographical sketches of each tanguero and supply insights into his/her performance style. Additionally, I offer an interpretative guide to the performance practices of this music by placing it in a cultural and historical context. Musicians can then not only be aware of contemporary tango and the ""Music of Buenos Aires,"" but they can obtain the necessarily knowledge to perform this music insightfully.",,,
884,Opinion Dynamics with Heterogeneous Interactions and Information Assimilation,"In any modern society, individuals interact to form opinions on various topics, including economic, political, and social aspects. Opinions evolve as the result of the continuous exchange of information among individuals and of the assimilation of information distributed by media. The impact of individuals' opinions on each other forms a network, and as the time progresses, their opinions change as a function of structure of such network. It is a central question whether this interaction and assimilation process leads to a socially benecial aggregation of information. My work mainly addresses complex problems in the analysis of opinion evolution in (i) heterogeneous societies and (ii) societies with large population under the influence of exogenous events. In both topics, bounded condence models of opinion dynamics are considered: an individual changes its opinion in a discrete fashion, by taking into consideration only those other agents whose beliefs are within a certain bound of condence from its own opinion. In the study of opinion dynamics in heterogeneous networks: agents are classied based on their interaction network, the existence of a leader group is established, and sufficient condition for the convergence of agent's opinions to a nal set of decisions is derived. In the study of opinion evolution in a large population driven by peer-to-peer interactions and exogenous events: the convergence of population's distribution to clusters concentrated around separate opinions is proved; an empirical upper bound on the largest population that a xed input can attract to its center is computed; a linear relation between this largest attracted population and systems parameters such as agents' bound of trust is conjectured; and performance of dierent manipulation strategies are evaluated based on the limited attraction range of the manipulator agent.",,,
885,m-Plane Homoepitaxy and Equilibrium Crystal Shapes of Gallium Nitride by Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy,"Nonpolar and semipolar growth of GaN has been shown to offer a promising path for high performance devices. These non-basal plane orientations allow for minimization of the polarization effects seen in c-plane GaN which cause spatial separation of the electron and hole wavefunctions (Quantum Confined Stark Effect). Yet despite the advantages these planes present, there remains consistent problems in both their growth and the lack of substrates. This dissertation focuses on the growth of these nonpolar and semipolar planes, in particular the homoepitaxy of m-plane GaN. The equilibrium crystal shape of GaN and its stable facets were also investigated. It is hoped that with this work, progress is made towards low defect large area nonpolar and semipolar substrates and their improved vapor phase growth. Work was initially done on m-plane regrowth by hydride vapor phase epitaxy. Extended defect generation, in particular basal plane stacking faults (BPSF), and poor morphology control are consistent problems in m-plane growth. These issues have prevented the expansion and multiplication of m-plane GaN substrates. In this work the effects of carrier gas were investigated on m-plane regrowth. Hydrogen carrier gas was shown to create highly faceted 3D nucleation. These islands had exposed N-face facets which lead to BPSF generation. In contrast, nitrogen carrier gas lead to 2D growth and thus minimized BPSF generation. These stacking faults were then characterized by both reciprocal space mapping and cathodolumienscence where type I1 and I2 faults were observed in the regrown GaN. Further work was done in exploring the equilibrium crystal shapes of GaN under varying growth conditions. Selective area growth experiments were done on high quality bulk m-plane GaN substrates where GaN facets were exposed to show the stable polar, semipolar and nonpolar planes. From these facets the kinetic Wulff plots for GaN were constructed. This work highlights the stable growth conditions for nonpolar and semipolar GaN and leads to improved growth conditions. AlN growth by HVPE is also investigated in this dissertation with work being done on thick AlN growth on patterned sapphire substrates (PSS). These templates were made for the purpose of substrates for UV LEDs.",,,

887,Effects of APP Intracellular Domain (AICD) Overexpression and Inflammation on Tau Biochemistry in Neuronal Cells,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal form of dementia exhibiting two major cellular pathologies: extracellular amyloid plaques (comprised of amyloid-beta, a cleavage product of amyloid precursor protein (APP)), and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau (a microtubule-regulatory protein). The mechanistic links between these pathologies are not yet known, but some evidence implicates the APP intracellular domain (AICD) in mediating tau phosphorylation and neuron death. Another process linked to AD and other neurodegenerative diseases is inflammation. The research presented here investigated the ability of AICD and inflammation to alter tau phosphorylation. AICD overexpression was not found to be toxic in PC12 cells, nor did it alter tau phosphorylation. However, AICD overexpression in primary neuronal cultures did affect tau biochemistry, indicating that this fragment can have disparate roles in different cellular contexts. A cell-culture approximation of the neuroinflammatory state, based on treatment with individual pro-inflammatory cytokines, showed that treatment with TNFalpha is toxic without affecting tau phosphorylation, while IL-6 is capable of increasing phosphorylation. Together, these data demonstrate the importance of cellular context in determining the function of AICD, as well as the complexity of the inflammatory process in potentiating tau-related neurodegenerative disease. Further investigations of the contributions of AICD and neuroinflammation to tau pathology may enable a more integrated depiction of the mechanism of AD. In one final study, it was observed that tau overexpression in primary neurons leads to neurite fragmentation.",,,
888,Double-diffusive instabilities in sediment-laden systems,"When a layer of particle-laden fresh water is placed above clear, saline water, both double-diffusive and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities may arise. Such a configuration can arise from hypopycnal river outflows into the salty ocean. The presence of these two instabilities can increase the flux of sediment out of the plume beyond that predicted by Stokes settling of individual particles. In addition, the presence of settling particles modifies traditional double-diffusive fingering to create a distinctly different mode. With this motivation in mind, we study the modification of the double-diffusive instability in the presence of settling particles using the tools of linear stability (LS) and direct numerical simulation (DNS). An important parameter that arises from LS results is the ratio of the unstable layer thickness to the diffusive interface thickness of the salinity profile. When this value is small, the instability eigenmodes primarily resemble double-diffusive modes, while at larger values the sediment and salinity interfaces become increasingly decoupled and the dominant instability mode becomes Rayleigh-Taylor like. Results from DNS show that this parameter quickly grows before plateauing at a constant value for the rest of the simulation. This value is determined solely by the balance between the advective settling flux of sediment into the rose region and the fingering flux out. The balance between the settling and fingering fluxes is characterized by the settling velocity, the salinity Schmidt number and the stability ratio. For settling-dominated situations, we show that the resulting instability mode becomes a phase-locked fingering mode. This mode has the same spectral content as the traditional fingering mode but the large scale convective overturning generated by the Rayleigh-Taylor mode creates a phase-locking that results in very thin, wisp-like plumes released from the base of the unstable layer. Across a large range of parameters, the interfacial sediment flux is seen to scale most appropriately with the pure double-diffusive flux. This is contrary to the traditional method of basing the flux on the Stokes settling velocity. In addition, a flux enhancement coefficient is calculated which corrects the double-diffusive flux in settling-dominated systems.",,,
889,Edge Interoperability for High-Performance Optical Core Network Routers,"Traffic in today's backbone networks is dominated by Internet protocol (IP) applications and is continuously increasing. The increasing demand is driven by video streaming, cellular phone technologies, and the vast amounts of information stored in data centers. Traffic volumes exceeding 1PB (>1,000 Terabytes) per business day have been reported and are expected to increase by more than tenfold over the next decade. Current electronic core network routers rely on a store-and-forward technique that requires optical-electronic-optical (OEO) conversions of high-speed data in order to route packets. This technique requires each bit of incoming data to be processed by high-speed electronics which tend to be rather power intensive and do not scale efficiently with the increasing trends in traffic demand. Optical data routers (ODRs) and optical packet switching (OPS) are currently being investigated as potentially scalable, energy efficient alternatives to current electronic routers. The OPS scheme utilizes a packet format consisting of a low-speed header followed by high-speed payload. The routing of such a packet is performed by processing the header via low-speed electronics that are relatively inexpensive in terms of cost and power dissipation while allowing the payload to be transparently processed entirely in the optical domain. Adaptation layers are required at the edge of core optical networks to facilitate the interoperability between current electronic and future optical networks. Successful router demonstrations have relied heavily on fixed-length packet formats, which require edge adaptation layers to perform computationally complex fragmentation algorithms to break larger variable-length packets into smaller fixed-length packets. The fragmentation process is viewed as detrimental to performance because of its inherent latency penalties and by the fact that re-transmission of entire datasets is required if individual fragments are lost. This dissertation presents enabling technology required for low-latency, low packet loss, interoperability between today's electronic networks and future optical networks. Adaptation between legacy 100 megabit Ethernet (MbE) and 40Gb/s OPS formats is successfully achieved by utilizing custom, FPGA-based Edge Adaptation Layers that demonstrate latencies below 300ns and packet loss rates less than 1E-5. Latency penalties are minimized by forgoing the fragmentation process at the edge and enforcing variable-length packet compatibility within optical core routers. A re-sizable optical buffer is designed and implemented to enable all-optical routers to accommodate packet lengths ranging from 40 to 800 bytes with less than 5% packet loss. This dissertation culminates in an end-to-end ODR link demonstration utilizing an energy efficient FPGA-based electronic control and UCSB-fabricated photonic integrated circuits (PICs) housed in custom package sub-mounts and FPGA-based driving circuitry. The end-to-end link demonstration successfully achieves adaptation between 100MbE and 40Gb/s optical packet formats, optical packet buffering, forwarding, and 3R regeneration (re-amplification, re-shaping, and re-timing) of 40Gb/s optical packets at packet loss rates below 1%.",,,
890,Reciprocity at the Core: Centralized and Reticulate Infrastructures in the Movements for and against Same-Sex Marriage,"Previous scholarship has well documented the infrastructure of the LGBT movement for same-sex marriage as relatively thin and ""weak,"" dominated by a few centralized, professionally managed social movement organizations at the national level that are asymmetrically linked to peripheral state and local organizations that in turn are largely factionalized and disconnected from each other. Conversely, the infrastructure of the Religious Right anti-gay marriage countermovement is described as relatively thick, strong and cohesive, headed by corporate style, multi-issue social movement organizations that form internally-dense centers of leadership with bridging ties to blocks of grassroots and constituent groups across multiple regions. Combined, these yield a set of propositions about (1) the multi-institutional fields in which the respective movements are embedded; (2) the structural shape and characteristics of the respective movement infrastructures; and (3) the organization of leadership across the two movements. I employ a set of network-theoretic approaches to assess whether these claims hold under empirical evaluation. I find aspects of centralized and decentralized structures to characterize both movements, but in generally opposite patterns. The strong leadership of the LGBT movement is largely centralized, but peripheral weak ties counter this tendency by integrating the broader network. The strong leadership of the Religious Right countermovement is largely reticulate, but weak ties counter this tendency by influencing the network toward a high degree of centralization. I advance the concept of network identity to characterize the unique configuration of organization, movement and solidary collective identities (Gamson 1991; Rupp and Taylor 1999) that are structured by densely linked sub-networks of strong movement leaders.",,,
891,"Thinking Through Race: Social Construction, Social Cognition, and the Unconscious Maintenance of Racial Hierarchy","In the post-civil rights era, nearly every American voices support for principles of racial equality. Yet, racial hierarchy and oppression persist. Scholars studying race and racism in the post-civil rights era have offered a number of potential explanations for this apparent contradiction. Some focus on the effects of structurally racist institutions. Others explain the persistence of racial injustice as the effect of colorblind racist ideology. Thus, in the post-civil rights era, both structural and ideological explanations have been offered for the persistence of racial inequality. In this dissertation, I offer an alternative explanation for the persistence of racial hierarchy and injustice in the post-civil rights era. Rather than focusing on institutions or ideology, my analysis is centered on identity. Specifically, I take up the question: how do we explain the ways in which even well-meaning whites contribute to the maintenance of social hierarchies? Answering this question requires careful attention to the discourses and institutions that influence the formation of the white subject as well as an account of the way in which socially constructed subjectivity functions. In this theory-building project, I bring together two distinct research traditions in the service of answering this question: Foucauldian social constructivism and the social cognition literature from social psychology. In the early chapters of the dissertation, I argue Foucauldian social constructivism and social cognition research are not only compatible, but may even complement one another in ways that can extend each literature's analytical domain. Next, I offer an integration of Foucauldian analysis and social cognitive theory to explain the social construction of identity and identities' effects on cognition through identity-driven motivated cognitive processes. Finally, I argue that the internalization of a white identity scheme produces sufficient motivation for whites to engage in motivated racial cognition. Since motivation affects cognition at every stage, whites perceive and interpret the social environment in ways that protect both their unearned advantages and their sense of themselves as fair and equitable actors. As a result, even well-meaning white people may replicate existing power relations without being aware of their role in the maintenance of systems of domination.",,,
892,Three Essays On Enforcement and Compliance with Water Regulation in the United States,"This dissertation consists of three separate papers in environmental economics. The first chapter uses an event study to examine the transition from federal to state management of the Clean Water Act (CWA). I find that, overall, the transition from federal to state control has little effect on the fraction of facilities in violation. However, states with a long run prevalence of corruption see a large decrease in the fraction of facilities in violation after authorization relative to states without corruption. Alternative specifications support these findings. I explore whether the response to transition to state control differs across political ideology, GDP and income per capita, government size, environmental preferences and government management performance. None of these alternative state level characteristics seem to account for the observed difference. In the second chapter, joint work with Laura Grant, we measure the effects of nonprofit groups on enforcement and compliance of the Clean Water Act. We geographically link data from the EPA regarding facility inspections, violations, SNC Category I violations, enforcement actions and penalties with information about nearby nonprofit groups. Our results suggest that state governments decrease inspections as the number of groups increase. We also find a decrease in the most serious classification of effluent violations. However, we do not find changes in regulatory enforcement actions or penalties. The results suggest that groups affect compliance primarily through indirect oversight of firms rather than official regulatory channels. Using land cover as an instrumental variable strengthens our evidence that watershed groups encourage firm compliance and decrease official monitoring. In the third chapter, I examine the effectiveness of the Public Notification rule under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Safe Drinking Water Act addresses harmful contaminants in drinking water by providing states the authority to monitor public water systems, notify the public of exceedances above allowable levels and cite persistent violators. Violating water systems are subject to intense regulatory and public scrutiny. The relationship between violation status and contaminant levels has not been explored empirically. This paper addresses this relationship through an event study using data on arsenic and nitrate levels in California. I find that violation status has a significant positive effect on nitrate levels post violation, but no effect on arsenic levels. I also examine the effect of the 2006 arsenic Maximum Contaminant Level revision, finding a discontinuity in contaminant levels at revision. These results suggest that while public disclosure may deter systems from violating, once they go into violation the Public Notification Rule is not effective at encouraging a return to compliance.",,,
893,Geographies of Prayer: Place and Religion in Modern America,"The built environment has been a focus of the study of sacred space for decades. This dissertation examines late twentieth-century evangelical religious practices to show the construction of mobile, geographical, and imagined sacred spaces. The study thus identifies ways that space and spatial logic have become integral to the development of contemporary religion. As the narrative recounts, by the late 1970s increasingly charismatic elements could be seen in mainstream evangelical mission strategies. Followers of two movements---Power Evangelism and Signs and Wonders---claimed they received spiritual gifts that were effective tools for church growth. A number, calling themselves spiritual warriors, began to emphasize their participation in a battle between God and Satan as a precondition for successful evangelism, and in this context mobile practices like prayerwalking became popular as spiritual warfare. In the global March For Jesus praise movement, warriors found that leaving the physical space of a church provided them better access to the sacred spaces most integral to their religious goals. Obstacles to evangelism were often interpreted as the product of territorial demons. This led not only to new practices of mapping that pinpointed the location of demonic strongholds, but also to new conceptions of the world. For spiritual warriors, cultural problems from the past, such as disputes with indigenous peoples, became the source of present-day social problems. Proponents said they were discerning spiritual landscapes hidden in time and space, and then they mapped the results on contemporary places. Finally, as the dissertation argues, the city has been a persistent backdrop for spiritual warfare. Evangelists saw danger and opportunity in the world's growing urbanism. They also focused on the Bible's many urban references. Cities were not only Babylons doomed to God's judgment. They were also Jerichos for God's army to conquer or Jerusalems waiting to be transformed by the coming Kingdom of God.",,,
894,"The Master's Colorblind Tools: Hegemonic Racial Discourse and the Decolonial Imaginaries of Contemporary Afro-Panamanian, Black South African, and Chicana/o Literatures","A comparative study of the relation between the poetics and the politics of racial disavowal and antiracism across national borders and literary traditions, this dissertation examines the rhetorical contours of colorblindness and their implications for contemporary Afro-Panamanian, Black South African, and Chicana/o literatures, and for the production of knowledge. I consider colorblindness as an ideology and discourse, as well as a metaphor for the global attempt to invisibilize ""the colorline,---the relation of the darker races to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea"" that W.E.B. Du Bois in The Souls of Black Folk (1903) identified as the ""problem of the twentieth century."" While the colorline persists, colorblindness poses a crucial obstacle to its removal in the twenty-first century. While much contemporary racial theory posits the novelty of the current racial order and the hegemonic discourse that sustains it, this study examines overlaps and continuities between colonial, overt white supremacist, and colorblindness discourse, as well as unforeseen affinities between particular colonial and decolonial imaginaries. In the process, it uncovers the rhetorical manifestations of what I call an epistemology of disavowal, and shows that colorblindness is not a new discourse. I argue that maintaining the centrality of the conceptual category colonialism is itself necessary if we are to understand the rhetorical contours of colorblindness and their far-reaching implications in the twenty-first century. Just as the current racial order displays striking continuities with the colonial past, entanglement also defines colorblindness, a pan-white discourse whose reproduction, as this dissertation demonstrates, transcends historical, national, linguistic, literary, disciplinary, and racial boundaries. Anchored in colonial relations, the rhetorics and logics that structure colorblindness form part of the archive and repertoire of white knowledge, which I define as a discursive formation and literary tradition shaping, and shaped by, the white supremacist canon. I also conceptualize white knowledge as racial consciousness. Tracing colorblindness from the Americas to South Africa, the study concurrently illustrates the transportability of the discourse across time and space, its contextual and geographical particularity, and its inextricability from deeply entrenched colonial epistemologies and ontologies.",,,
895,Making Reflections/Reflecting Making: Clara Peeters and the Representation of Early Modern Authorship,"Focusing on Clara Peeters's (born Antwerp, 1594--c. 1657) 1612 painting Still Life with Gold Goblets and Collectibles, this paper examines the complex visuality of the still life self-image in reference to its implications on and statement about early modern authorship. In the first half of the seventeenth century, still life artists often inserted a reflected self-image within the contours of glass orbs and shiny golden goblets. Taking the position that Peeters's use of a reflected self-image initiates a dialogue between an image of making and the surface on which it manifests itself, this study argues that such reflections articulate contemporary theory about the mutual and collaborative nature of authorship by implicating multiple parties in the authoring process. This thesis thus examines contemporary ideas about the relationship between art and craft and the generative role of nature and natural image-making processes, such as reflections. As such, the paper looks toward a history of images of reflection within Netherlandish art, the legacy of Renaissance ideas regarding the relationship of artisanship and nature, and seventeenth-century Dutch art literature. In building a case for a collaborative understanding of authorship, this paper additionally turns to both modern authorship theory as well as to seventeenth-century studio practice. In conclusion, this thesis argues that Peeters's still life self-images seeks to advertise to the contemporary collector not just her identity or status as author, but her very understanding of how her authorship came to be.",,,
896,Designing Information Flow Secure Hardware,"Systems that require strong guarantees on security policies such as those used in banking and military rely on the proper implementation of the underlying hardware in respect to the flow of information. The most challenging task has been to design such systems with provable security properties without generating significant overhead. We show that it is possible and practical to design provably information flow secure embedded processors with minimum hardware overhead. Our insight is that programming language techniques for secure information flow can be applied to the field of hardware design to enable the creation of synchronous hardware designs that are statically-verifiable as secure. Such static techniques, when used in combination with dynamic information flow tracking, can achieve significant reduction in hardware overhead and increase in expressiveness. This dissertation presents an exploration of various approaches in designing hardware with strong security guarantees. We start by introducing Execution Lease, an architectural enforcement mechanism built upon a completely dynamic information flow tracking infrastructure. The idea is to associate every bit of data with security tags and maintain them precisely at runtime. These information are then used to provide timing and space boundary when invoking untrusted program components. In order to be able to formally reason about security properties of the resulting hardware, we propose Caisson, a programming language extension of Verilog that allows designers to specify security policies through a security type system along with explicit state machined based model. To maintain the capability of static verification while completely eliminating the need of duplicating resource for different security levels, we combine dynamic tracking techniques with language-based static verification, and introduce a new programming language Sapper. Sapper also allows designers to specify security types for data and signals, which instead of being type checked, will physically exist after fabrication and serve for the purpose of dynamic tracking. Runtime tracking and enforcement logic is generated by static analysis on the language such that the hardware overhead can be minimized along with static guarantees. At the end, we use Sapper to build complex embedded processor that is guaranteed to enforce non-interference, and we show that the hardware overhead is minimum.",,,
897,"The Synthesis of (+)-Brevisamide, (+)-NPS R-568 and Cinacalcet","Protecting groups play an important role in the process of multistep synthesis of complex molecules due to functional group tolerance. Specific functional groups cannot survive required reagents or chemical environments in the process to synthesis a target molecule so they must be protected to survive the reaction conditions and later be deprotect to their original form. However, protecting a functional group is not ideal because it adds additional steps and material costs to the process. To enhance the efficiency of the synthesis of (+)-Brevisamide, (+)-NPS R-568 and Cinacalcet we kept in mind the concept of being atom economical by avoiding protecting groups.",,,
898,Hazing as a Manifestation of Evolved Psychology,"Hazing is the abuse of new or prospective group members. What motivates individual hazing behavior? Why does hazing take particular but reliable forms in some organizations? Using experimental, ethnographic, and archival research methods, this dissertation explores general motivational predictors of hazing behavior as well as specific manifestations of hazing in college social fraternities. Results suggest (1) consistent predictors of hazing that may reflective adaptive problems within human ancestral environments, and (2) context-specific manifestations of hazing that may represent a variety of cognitive processes and social negotiations. Findings are discussed in light of hazing's abiding need for systematic research and hypothesis testing.",,,
899,The Impact of Stress on Category Learning and Consolidation Within the Explicit and Procedural Systems,"Despite the real-life application, little research has been done examining the impact of stress on category learning. For example, how does stress impact different types of category learning and consolidation, specifically rule-based and information-integration? A study was conducted with 123 undergraduate college students to compare the impact of stress on learning and consolidation for explicit and procedural learning systems. Approximately half of the participants were stressed on session one using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and then given a rule-based (RB) learning task (29 participants) or an information-integration (II) learning task (30 participants). The other half of the participants completed the TSST control condition and a RB learning task (32 participants) while another 32 participants completed an II task. Five cortisol samples were obtained from each participant on session one. To examine consolidation, participants were asked to return for a second session the following day to complete the same category-learning task again (without the stress). Analysis of the data showed a significant detriment in accuracy for the RB condition as cortisol increased throughout the task, which was replicated with the COVIS model of category learning. This finding was expected within the RB task since stress impairs working memory and decreases long-term potentiation. For the II condition, participants were separated into three different cortisol levels (not conditions), and those who had the lowest accuracy were those whose cortisol levels remained stable across the study. Within the II task, however, the impairment is likely due to the increased rule-use of those within the middle cortisol group, which could suggest a competition between the two systems. This finding was also replicated with the COVIS model. Furthermore, these trends continued into session two.",,,
900,Novel Methods of Augmenting High Performance Processors with Security Hardware,"When developing a microprocessor, designers are asked to balance a growing number of tradeoffs for a system's intended set of applications. These design decisions, such as sharing cache space between cores, are often statically defined and limit the usability of the processor for other applications. Since processor manufacturers are economically influenced, most resulting designs show a strong affinity towards optimizing common design goals such as high performance and low power usage. Unfortunately, other design aspects can be overlooked or ignored entirely, which is problematic as we enter a new era of computing where processors play an important role in critical systems and security becomes a paramount concern. To ensure the appropriate security policies are enforced on high assurance systems, designers must often undertake the time-consuming task of redesigning processors from the ground up. This is a cumbersome task and increases in difficulty with an ever-changing threat model with which these systems are concerned. While the resulting systems are successful in mitigating security problems, they pale in comparison to their commercial counterparts in terms of performance. Ideally, the low-cost and high-performance parts being manufactured today for the average user can be leveraged in a system processing data and executing code of mixed trust. In an effort to counter the current state of computing where processors lack security functionality and configurability, new design directions are needed to create processors that can be retrofitted with new hardware in response to different usage models. This dissertation focuses on discovering and analyzing methods of extending an existing design to cater to applications past the one it was originally developed for, with a concentration on security. We show that the functionality of a processor can be extended after making minimal changes to its design. We introduce several novel methods of adding security hardware to processors through the use of 3-D Integration, resulting in processors that are secure without sacrificing performance. We also show how these same methods can be used to make a processor extensible in its computational abilities by augmenting the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).",,,
901,"Shadows of Perfection: Illness, Disability, and Sin in American Religious Healing, from the Civil War to World War I","In the late nineteenth century three major religious healing movements---evangelical divine healing, Christian Science, and New Thought---emerged and thrived in the United States. While these movements diverged from one another in significant ways, they all emphasized the potential perfectibility of both soul (or ""mind"") and body. Together, they were a substantial force in challenging traditional Calvinist notions of the potentially salvific power of illness and disability experiences. This dissertation examines ideas, metaphorical references, and narratives about illness and disability in the writings of participants in these movements. It argues that all three religious movements maintained a strong etiological linkage between sin and bodily malfunction, even as they promised the possibility of the abolition of both. In so doing, these movements challenged associations that would link worldly weakness and impotency with religion, and thereby encouraged Americans to see spiritual power as a force that could change all aspects of their lives. Inevitably, however, dreams of perfectible, ""normal"" bodies promoted in these movements implied a shadow-world of ill and disabled ones. Ultimately, those people whose bodies remained impaired were implicitly cast as religious, as well as worldly, failures. These movements became important sources from which many twentieth- and twenty-first-century Americans drew ideas as they sought to understand the relationship between mental, spiritual, and physical health and are thus important to consider if we seek to interpret vernacular religious attitudes towards illness and disability today.",,,
903,Smart Reading: The Science of Intelligence in Twentieth Century American Literature,"Smart Reading contributes to the field of American Studies by investigating how the advent of a science of intelligence---beginning with IQ tests---influenced American writers after the turn of the twentieth century. Historically speaking, such a science marked a shift in our understanding of intelligence because it was no longer a reflection of one's education, social class, or biography. It came to be a fixed biological fact. Drawing on theory in disciplines as diverse as cognitive science, literary studies, geography, philosophy and sociology, this project argues that the language of intelligence therefore depends on the science (and pseudoscience) of race. Whereas the concept of intelligence has been deployed to restrict access of racial Others to American institutions, the nation has depended on those racial Others to define the terms of intelligence. Furthermore, the American experience of different ethnic groups has helped to congeal a phenomenological theory of intelligence that takes into account the relationship between a subject and her lived space. Specifically, this dissertation focuses on the ethnic groups of Jews, African Americans and American Indians. Key primary texts include Three Lives by Gertrude Stein, The Portrait of a Lady by Henry James, Home to Harlem by Claude McKay, Dreams From My Father by Barack Obama, The Surrounded by D'Arcy McNickle, Zuckerman Unbound by Philip Roth, and Neuromancer by William Gibson.",,,
904,Religion and Power among the Eastern Pueblos of New Mexico: Patron Saint's Feast Days as Sites of Adaptation and Continuity within Colonial and National Contexts,"In this dissertation I seek to understand the Pueblo Patron Saint's Feast Days as sites of resistance, accommodation, and appropriation in their negotiation of colonial and national rule. I trace the development of the Feast Days and the colonial and missionary contexts involved in this process, as well as the ways in which Catholicism and the Feast Days became part of Pueblo tradition. Using historical primary and secondary sources, the work of anthropologists and archeologists, and my own qualitative fieldwork, I argue that the Feast Days developed as a way to negotiate the imposition of Catholicism with the necessary continuance of Pueblo ceremonial practices making them an important way in which the Eastern Pueblos integrated a foreign ceremonial system into their own already extensive and demanding ceremonial calendar, largely on their own terms. Taking ceremonial activities that had traditionally been public and open to surrounding Pueblos, these social ceremonies could involve not only the Franciscans but the Spanish colonists, creating a safe ritual space that allowed for the continuation of necessary ceremonial activities. During this process, aspects of Catholicism became important to the Pueblos, becoming a part of their ""traditions."". With the official conquest by United States in 1848, a new set of rules, government, and religious institutions needed to be negotiated. I argue that the Patron Saint's Feast Days not only provided an argument for the Catholicism of the Pueblos as a way to resist the intrusion of Protestant missionaries, but also offered public ceremonial activities that could be used to assuage the curiosity of outsiders.",,,
905,Photonic Crystal Microcavities for Quantum Information Science,"Quantum information science and technology is a broad and fascinating field, encompassing diverse research areas such as materials science, atomic physics, superconductors, solid-state physics, and photonics. A goal of this field is to demonstrate the basic functions of information initialization, manipulation, and read-out in systems that take advantage of quantum physics to greatly enhance computing performance capabilities. In a hybrid quantum information network, different systems are used to perform different functions, to best exploit the advantageous properties of each system. For example, matter quantum bits (qubits) can be used for local data storage and manipulation while photonic qubits can be used for long-distance communication between storage points of the network. Our research focuses on the following two solid-state realizations of a matter qubit for the purpose of building such a hybrid quantum network: the electronic spin of a self-assembled indium arsenide quantum dot and the electronic spin of a nitrogen-vacancy defect center in diamond. Light--matter interactions are necessary to transfer the information from the matter qubit to the photonic qubit, and this interaction can be enhanced by embedding the spin system in an optical cavity. We focus on photonic crystal microcavities for this purpose, and we study interactions between the optical cavity modes and incorporated spin systems. To improve the performance of this spin--photon interface, it is important to maximize the coupling strength between the spin and photonic systems and to increase the read-out efficiency of information stored in the cavity. In this thesis, we present our work to deterministically couple a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond to a photonic crystal microcavity in gallium phosphide. This is achieved by nanopositioning a pre-selected diamond nanocrystal in the intensity maximum of the optical cavity mode. We also present an optimized design of a photonic crystal microcavity in gallium arsenide that provides optimal trade-off between strength of interaction with an embedded quantum dot and efficiency of light extraction from the cavity mode, and we experimentally demonstrate the improved characteristics of this cavity design. These results represent key developments of quantum information technologies on a solid-state platform.",,,
906,Proxy Cultures: Circumvention in Turkish Information Society,"This work analyzes digital censorship in Turkey, a country incorporating features of both Middle Eastern and E.U. regulation into its ICT policy framework, and often categorized as a hybrid space between Eastern and Western approaches towards information freedom. Utilizing theories of digital media and networks, as well as two years of ethnographic fieldwork, I argue that Internet Studies research on web censorship must include a thorough study of circumvention. In this multi-sited project, I investigate why state authorities and private corporations engaging in circumvention are portrayed as the driving forces behind Turkish information society, yet students, teachers, minorities, cybercafe owners, IT distributors and journalists are criminalized as hackers, pirates and terrorists. Using ""proxy"" as an analytical tool, I contend that: 1) If considered in isolation, representations of cyber-censorship as national and Internet-based obfuscate the ways that cyber-censorship is also transnational and multi-medial; 2) Circumvention is ubiquitous in Turkish information society, although many forms are hidden or portrayed as anomalous by the mainstream press; 3) Human and technological intermediaries conflict and collaborate in order to implement or impede ICT policies; and 4) The borders distinguishing discourses of authorized use from criminal use of digital technology interrelate with the control over resource flow across political, economic and media networks. I use the multiple connotations of vekil, the Turkish word for ""proxy""---political representative, economic guarantor and routing technology---to broaden the concept of circumvention to include human, institutional and technological relationships. The vekil-proxy's status as an autonomous intermediary that reroutes clients to their desired resources affords it an opportunity to abuse its power. Each of the chapters explores a different case of the subversive, dangerous or empowering repercussions of unchecked proxy autonomy. Thus emerges ""proxy cultures,"" an analytic with which I decouple circumvention from criminality and demonstrate how state authorities, corporations and the mainstream media each engage in forms of circumvention which are hidden by discourses on information society, technological literacy, cultural tradition and national security. The conclusion establishes the concept of threshold as a lens with which to more accurately understand the complex relationships between circumvention and censorship in Turkey's information society.",,,
907,Taking a leap to close the gap: Early academic success of low-income Latino/a children facing multiple risks,"The achievement gap is a persisting problem faced by schools nationwide. Although student achievement is on the rise overall, the achievement gap between minority/disadvantaged students and those of their White/advantaged peers continues to persist. What is even more discouraging is that this gap is evidenced on the first day children enter Kindergarten (Rumberger & Arrellano, 2007). Researchers have identified both risk and promotive factors contributing to school readiness. This study contributes to resilience and school readiness research by highlighting familial promotive factors that contribute to early academic success. This mixed-methods study investigated which factors contributed most strongly to the academic success of Latino/a students at the end of the Kindergarten school year, by utilizing and creating cumulative risk and cumulative promotive indices. The promotive index significantly predicted the children's academic outcomes, yielding higher early literacy scores at the end of the year. The risk index did not, however, significantly predict students' scores. The risk index was used to identify students who had multiple risks, but despite these risks were able to improve their academic trajectories by the end of the school year. Qualitative interviews were conducted with the parents of these children. Common familial factors that contributed to early academic resilience among these families were highlighted. These themes included: parent involvement at school, strong emphasis on family unity, parent acknowledgement of the child's positive attributes, fostering autonomy, and an open and explanatory style of communication. Clinical and research implications of these findings are discussed.",,,
908,Dynamics of Persuasion in Response to Public Service Announcements,"Past health campaigns were rarely research-driven; consequently, publicly funded campaigns have failed, leading to no effects or even shifts in attitude counter to those intended. Recent success with research-driven campaigns illustrates the importance of further research into the mechanisms of message processing among audiences. At the same time, media theory has shifted over the last several decades from ""effects"" models to ""processing"" models, yet most communication research still neglects to examine processes as such---over time. In this dissertation, the process of persuasion in response to anti-drug public service announcements is examined in a young-adult sample over time. Three studies are used ultimately to test theoretically generated models of argument and audiovisual-feature effects on reported persuasion in audience members, provided over time during message receipt. Study 1 examines static arguments, developing a method for estimating the strength of an isolated argument for an individual audience member; findings suggest that argument strength is contextual and sensitive to individual differences. Study 2 concerns how these arguments combine in a multi-argument message, and how time and order affect persuasive outcomes. Changes in belief depended on the discrepancy between the current argument strength and the current belief, and evaluations were subject to a recency effect. Study 3 combines the effects of overt arguments with audiovisual features in actual advertisements. Interactions between message features and individual characteristics dominated the results, suggesting that the mechanisms of action for arguments and other message features are complex. Conclusions can be classified into 4 themes: the contextual nature of argument strength, the role of involvement in biased processing, the relationship between information density cognitive requirements, and the effects of time and order on persuasive outcomes. Practically, these results imply that, while using scholarship to design messages is superior to atheoretical work, reliance on main-effect relationships between message features and persuasion is unlikely to lead to desired attitude change---i.e., designing messages with high ""argument strength"" and/or message-sensation value, without consideration of how these features will interact with one another and with characteristics of the audience, is not enough to produce a message with a high likelihood of success.",,,
910,Stress Engineering for Semipolar (2021) Blue and Green InGaN Based Laser Diodes,"High performance InGaN-based green laser diodes (LDs) will enable new laser-based display application. Semipolar (2021) offers advantages over conventional c-plane grown LDs in terms of reduced polarization related electric fields and higher differential gain. One of many challenges towards improving green LDs is the decrease in optical confinement factor (OCF) with lasing wavelength due to index dispersion. Relaxation of misfit strain via bend and glide of pre-existing threading dislocations (TDs) limits (2021) oriented LDs to lower waveguiding/cladding thickness relative to c-plane. Understanding and managing strain relaxation in semipolar GaN-based heterostructures is critical to the development of high performance semipolar oriented LDs. To establish a platform for studying stress management on (20 21) oriented LDs, coherent green LDs are developed. The link between post-QW annealing effects and the size of dark triangle defects is clarified and used to demonstrate 511 nm LDs with GaN barriers, having threshold current density (Jth) of 15 kA/cm-2. Additionally, the first true-green ITO-clad LD with a lasing wavelength of 518 nm is demonstrated. Secondary relaxation on inclined m-planes is observed, identified and linked to TD generation. Si and Mg doping is shown to significantly alter semipolar relaxation by suppressing m-plane slip significantly more than c-plane slip. 2D relaxation was investigated via thick, graded composition buffers and stripe patterning based elastic relaxation, but was always accompanied by TD generation in the mid 108--10 9 cm-2. Metamorphic LDs are developed utilizing 1D relaxed n-InGaN layers as the lower waveguide in GaN-clad LD structures. Hole blocking layers are found to significantly suppress MD related non-radiative losses. Blue LDs with Jth as low as 4 kA/cm-2 are demonstrated. Patterning mesas into the substrate before growth, known as limited area epitaxy (LAE), is shown to block TD glide. Using LAE, InGaN and AlGaN layers having thicknesses 5--7 times greater than their theoretical critical thickness are grown without significant MD formation. High performance blue and green LAE LDs having an OCF as much as two times greater than standard planar LDs are demonstrated at 456 nm with Jth of 4.5 kA/cm2 and at 523 nm with Jth of 12 kA/cm2.",,,
912,"Doing Math, Doing Gender: Enactments of Expertise and Femininity Among Math and Science Undergraduate Women","The underrepresentation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields is well-documented and enduring (Huang et al. 2000; National Science Foundation 2004, 2011), particularly in fields that require extensive mathematical training (Ceci & Williams 2010). Attempts to identify the source of the gender gap have indicated that causes range from interactional (Bergvall & Remlinger 1996) to institutional (Moss-Racusin 2012). Some research has suggested that the perception of STEM fields as ""unfeminine"" reduces young girls' interest in them. This idea positions expert STEM identities as at odds and incompatible with feminine identities (Thomas-Hunt & Philips 2004). Using data from a large ethnographic study on the cultural and linguistic practices of high-achieving math and science undergraduates at a public university in Southern California, this thesis argues that mathematical expertise can indeed be enacted along with a range of feminine personae. Focusing on three female students who regularly show expertise in their small peer groups in a multivariable calculus course, I argue that each woman enacts expertise while performing different gendered styles. One student claims a more traditional nerd girl identity, eschewing slang and traditional forms of feminine material self-presentation and using a formal mathematical register and unmarked intonation. The second student, while often forceful that she is right, employs a marked nasal whiny intonation when contesting the teaching assistant's decisions and advice, constructing a kind of childlike cute femininity. The third student enacts expertise within her otherwise all-male peer group, and physically presents herself as more emblematic of youthful, middle-class femininity while employin non-interrogative rising intonation, a practice often ideologically seen as feminine. This study shows that a range of feminine styles is not incompatible with expert STEM identities. This research implies that for STEM educators concerned with gender equity, by recognizing that expertise can be accompanied by any kind of gendered persona, women should be encouraged to explore career paths in STEM fields without feeling that they need to conform to a certain type of feminine style.",,,
913,Design and Characterization of Fibrillar Adhesives,"The climbing ability of the Tokay gecko has attracted much attention from scientists trying to reproduce the adhesive found on the animal's feet. Many of the impressive properties of the adhesive have been attributed to the micrometer- and nanometer-sized fibers and how they are moved, or articulated, during adhesive placement and separation. Using microfabrication techniques, fibrillar structures were created and tested using a home-built testing apparatus specifically designed to characterize tribological properties over millimeter-sized areas. The results confirm that fiber geometry and fiber articulation are both important for gecko-inspired adhesives. Tilted and vertical microfabricated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) rectangular flaps were created to determine if non-circular structures, similar in shape to the terminal features of the gecko, could be used to create a controllable adhesive. The control of the adhesive was achieved by varying shear length and direction to contact different parts of the flaps. A high adhesion force was achieved when contacting the side face of the flaps, lower adhesion force when contacting the top of the flaps, and almost zero adhesion force when contacting the edge between the top and side faces of the flaps. The addition of tilt resulted in anisotropic behavior, creating both a gripping direction and a releasing direction. The effect of fiber shape was then explored by using a semicircular cross section. The PDMS fibrillar adhesive was the first single material vertical adhesive without fiber tip modification to exhibit adhesion and friction anisotropy. Using a simple microfabrication process, differences in contact area caused anisotropic behavior when displaced towards and against the flat face of the fiber. The vertical fibers even showed higher anisotropy values than some tilted structures. As a continuation of the testing on vertical semicircular fibers, tilt was again added to the design. The adhesion forces and anisotropy of the PDMS angled fibers were higher than the previous designs, illustrating the importance of both fiber shape and tilt for anisotropy. The shear forces were also high and the shear pressure reached 88% of the value obtained when testing the two front feet of the gecko. The adhesive was then tested over 10,000 cycles and retained 118% of its initial shear force and 77% of its initial adhesion force. The performance of this adhesive is comparable to other high lifetime gecko-inspired adhesives. As an alternative to the geometric design of the fibers, the influence of fiber articulation, that is how the fibers are moved, was explored using a common vertical testing procedure and was compared to an angled testing procedure. Both tests were shown to result in similar maximal shear and adhesion forces. The angled testing procedure also showed high adhesion to preload ratios (mu') which have been shown to be important for robot stability when climbing. By choosing the correct approach angle, shear length, and retraction angle, a single testing procedure was shown to achieve a high shear force, a high adhesion force, and a high mu' value, resulting in an optimal articulation.",,,
914,When Muslims are not Muslims: The Ahmadiyya Community and the Discourse on Heresy in Indonesia,"The concepts of orthodoxy and heresy mostly refer to the politics of domination between competing groups to determine which one shall be considered the bearer of the 'correct' beliefs. The winning party would claim its teachings orthodox, while the losing party would be condemned as heretics. The concept of orthodoxy-heresy, therefore, does not imply whether a certain belief system is true or false. The orthodoxy-heresy nexus is a common phenomenon in any society and embedded in the history of all religions. The problem is whether or not a certain society allows a place for 'heretical' belief system. If they do not accept it, this raises significant questions: What is the limit of orthodoxy where dissent can still be tolerated? How are those who have dissenting belief systems treated? What is the stance of state power in this theological issue, staying neutral or taking sides with a certain belief system? To answer these questions, this thesis studies the Ahmadiyya community, often considered the most influential heretical group in Islam, and employs an in-depth qualitative case study. To give various perspectives on their plight, this thesis has focused on three locations: Cikeusik, Manis Lor, and Asrama Transito. Data for this study were collected through multiple sources. They include personal observations; archival records; interviews; audiovisual material; literature written by prominent figures of the Ahmadiyya; documents from both the Ahmadiyya and its opponents; fatwas from certain Muslim organizations; government decrees; and reports from human rights organizations. Together, the data allow for a detailed description of the distinctive beliefs of the Ahmadiyya, the development of this community, the various types of opposition to this community, the matrix of the persecution, and the response of the Ahmadiyya to persecution. The results of this research show that the alliance between religious authority and certain state power has often become an underlying factor behind the persecution of 'heretical' groups. The religious authority, for instance, issues a fatwas that gives an ideological justification for opposing---or further, persecuting---allegedly heretical groups. The state bans religious groups deemed heretical or prohibits the public airing of certain teachings deemed heterodox and allows for the persecution of those groups, for instance, when the state indirectly shares its sovereignty with vigilante groups that appoint themselves as religious police and enforcers of the fatwa..",,,
915,"Holy City under a Curse: Memory, History, and their Appropriation in Late Antique Jerusalem","My research examines the evolving nature of Jerusalem and its holy places in Late Antiquity, through the lenses of memory, history, and religion. The city was transformed in the fourth century into the Christian ""Holy Land,"" and this dissertation examines how the imperially-driven change either adapted or overcame the city's previous associations with Judaism and paganism. I approached the topic as one of the creation of ""places of memory,"" following several sociological theorists of memory (e.g. M. Halbwachs, P. Nora). The chapters include analysis of early boundary-creation between Christians and Jews and the memorializing and identity-affirming aspects of the literary genre of ecclesiastical history, which grew up in parallel with the creation of the ""Holy Land."" The chief source for this section is Eusebius, who was both historian and witness to the process in the fourth century. I assess whether sacred space could be turned on its head---was Jerusalem a blessed city, or a cursed one? Pilgrim literature helps to inform this section on attraction, avoidance, and shifting blame. That leads to analysis of the fifth-century ecclesiastical historians (who saw themselves as Eusebius' heirs, but grew up in a totally different world) and transfers of holiness: relics, especially from Jerusalem, spreading throughout the world. Finally, running throughout the work is the thread of marginalization of Jews and Jewish places of memory in the increasingly Christianized cultic topography of Jerusalem. The final chapter takes us through the seventh-century Arab conquest of Jerusalem, and analyzes the new complexities and competition for sacred real estate amongst all three faiths that now held the city to be holy. Much like today, Late Antique Jerusalem was both blessed and cursed simultaneously, claimed by multiple parties but never shared.",,,
916,A Synthetic Approach Towards Paecilospirone,"Our research focuses on the total synthesis of naturally occurring highly oxidized and densely functionalized carbon skeletons. The generation of dearomatized intermediates and o-quinone methides enable the rapid manipulation and derivatization of aromatic cores. o-Quinone methides in particular undergo a variety of reactions, but in the presence of enol ethers cycloaddition reactions predominate, which enable access to complex spiroketal derivatives. The use of this technology enables the generation of spiroketals in a kinetic fashion, not possible through traditional thermodynamic ketalizations. Herein, we will overview our studies towards finding an appropriate o-quinone methide precursor and demonstrate the application of this methodology towards the total synthesis of paecilospirone, a marine natural product whose unique chroman spiroketal core had not previously been encountered in nature prior to its isolation.",,,
918,Screening Human Rights: A media ethnography of the Human Rights Film Network and its festivals,"Screening Human Rights is an analysis of the Human Rights Film Network and its festivals as media-space. Using feminist ethnographic methods, I conducted fieldwork at seven human rights film festivals (HRFFs) across five continents, attended a Network members' meeting, and sat in as a participant-observer for two international training workshops focused on how to set up an HRFF. My findings demonstrate that the HRFF is a significant platform for the circulation of human rights images and independent media voices. They also evince that the HRFFs, while networked, are different from one another in their local contexts, and elaborate the ways in which lived experiences and practices within those festival spaces diverge from the HRFFs' discursive presentations. The individual festivals in the Network are joined by their human rights aspirations, an ethical imperative very much rooted in notions of truthfulness, as well as their dedication to fostering discussion and debate, and a shared belief that film can be a powerful medium for social change. By looking at these festival media-spaces historically, comparatively, and in relation to their shared Network charter, I identify a number of quandaries facing both the individual organizers and the larger Network entity, in particular with regard to how to negotiate the human rights framework, how to make an intervention while recognizing the high ethical stakes involved in doing so, and how best to pursue a vision of further globalizing the HRFF practice. In turn, this dissertation explores the themes and tensions underlying the important cultural work these festivals do---the challenges they work against, work around, and try to overcome---in order to make more comprehensible the significant role that HRFFs play in shaping global understandings of human rights, and the processes by which particular human subjects are made visible and relatable.",,,
919,"Land-Cover and Land-Use Change in Human-Environment Systems: Understanding Complex Interactions among Policy and Management, Livelihoods, and Conservation","Conservation challenges abound throughout the world and yet conservation priorities are typically sidelined in favor of economic incentives. This dissertation addresses the overall question of how conservation policy relates to connections between land and livelihoods. To address this question, I examine household land use and protected area (PA) policy goals, as mediated and informed by local management dynamics, household livelihood strategies and ecological knowledge. A satisfactory pursuit of this question requires an examination of how people weigh conservation and livelihood choices in settings of limited livelihood options. I examine land change, livelihoods, and environmental perception in the context of reforestation policy implementation in Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve (FNNR), China. I use a mixed methods approach to address the following three objectives at the landscape (objective 1) and household (objectives 2 and 3) scales: 1) Evaluate where and how forest change may have occurred in and around golden monkey habitat between 1996 and 2009. 2) Ascertain how (if at all) household-level socio-economic factors and crop damage explain variation in household-level reforestation. 3) Determine the extent (if at all) to which Sloped Land Conversion Program (SLCP) participation or other factors (land use, livelihood, demographics, conservation policy) relate to local perception of human impact on the environment. Methods integrate remote sensing, geographic information systems, landscape metrics, a semi-structured household survey, interviews with key village and reserve personnel, and logistic and ordered multinomial modeling. Results indicate the reserve contains more connected forest cover than surrounding areas but also highlight areas of potential concern for conservation sustainability. Overall, the reserve appears to benefit from the support of local residents. However, results also raise questions about the efficacy of a major reforestation program, the Sloped Land Conversion Program (SLCP) and reveal areas of concern for reserve management. Specifically, evidence does not indicate success in achieving the dual SLCP program goals of reforestation and poverty alleviation. In addition, ethnic minorities appear to be increasingly enrolling land in the program with varying outcomes for coupled livelihood and monkey habitat sustainability. Some ethnic minorities, particularly the Tujia, are associated with higher household reforestation levels than the Han majority and Miao minority, and reforestation participation may be related to ethnic minority-majority and minority-minority inequality. The relative household-level allocation of reforestation species---mainly pine, fir, bamboo, and tea, also appears related to ethnicity. This has an implication for livelihoods since tea can be a lucrative crop while wild pig damage is more concentrated among bamboo reforestation types, affecting the potential positive impacts of reduced wild pig damage associated with reduced cropland. Finally, environmental awareness of local residents may be limited without direct experience with the golden monkey, or even negative when crops are damaged by wild pigs. In order to protect the golden monkey and forest resources for the future, policy recommendations include integrating the many disparate conservation policies FNNR implements, forging stronger communication between the reserve and local communities regarding the benefits of conservation, mitigating human-wildlife conflict, and championing more community education on human impacts on the local environment.",,,
920,What Can Brown Do For You? Citizenship and Desire: The South Asian Diasporic Body,"This dissertation engages with historical and analytical queries on the corporeal raised by a recent surge of cultural productions whose central figures are South Asian Americans, and their tethering to discourses around citizenship in the United States. Sutured in image cultures, at the intersections of race, class, gender, and sexuality, these figurations manifest themselves in novels, short stories, political pamphlets, television programs, beauty pageants, films, and legal cases. This project focuses on the constructions of paradigmatic brown bodies as they appear in historical, legal, and popular representations, from the early twentieth century through the twenty-first century. It examines the ways in which a racialized sexuality is constitutive of these bodies, linking them to specific ethnic communities. It unpacks the anxieties and tensions that are inscribed on brown bodies; they are not new figures, but eruptions and refigurations of past spectacles that haunt the American imaginary. It presents a theory of civilized productivity by examining the ways that power, privilege, sexuality, pleasure, and gender are coded onto this population, and the connections those codes make with discourses around citizenship and nationalism. Along the way, the dissertation threads seemingly disparate objects of inquiry together through historical and creative contexts. ""What Can Brown Do For You?"" is an inquiry into the fantasies and realities about the South Asian and South Asian American presence in the United States. The cultural productions surrounding these bodies suggest a fascination with these bodies, coding them as threatening, expendable, and violent, but also mutable, and deeply desirable.",,,
921,The Birth of a New Old Age: The Retirement Era in American Myth,"Three national conferences on aging between 1950 and 1971 responded to the early twentieth century's radical changes in labor practices, life expectancy, and cultural modes of understanding aging and the nature of citizenship. My goal is to show that the conferences reveal how these shifts in aging and labor impacted the relationships among religion, science, politics, and national identity in the U.S. I primarily employ a historical methodology, and the bulk of my original primary research centers upon the rich archive of written documents produced before, during, and after the conferences. Each of these conferences brought together citizens, experts, and government and industry representatives. Together they generated policy recommendations and articulated national beliefs and values in a highly visible public forum. Conference framers claimed authority by constructing the meetings as embodiments of democracy that represented the unaltered voice of the people. Thus, conference participants and the authors of their reports performed religious work that is important to the study of religion in America but that has, to date, not been explored. I argue that the conferences sought to reestablish order over cultural chaos by joining their practical agenda with the creation of a more far-reaching national narrative about aging. Through them, the nation came to develop and articulate a new myth of aging that drew upon the deep well of national myth and symbol. The new myth's overarching goal was to protect aging citizens' independence and dignity. Life in retirement should blend leisure with ""useful"" activity contributing to self and community. Society was obliged to assure the minimum requirements of dignity for those unable to maintain this level of independence. While their often utopian vision sought to avoid the dehumanization of the elderly that would come from their exclusion from American life, inconsistent treatment of race and economic status threatened to deepen that exclusion for many. The conferences and their new myth make ideal candidates for religious studies analysis because they renegotiated what it meant to be human in changing cultural circumstances.",,,
922,The Marginality Behind the Marginality: Gypsies and Jazz Dancers in Bohemian Paris,"The mythologized wandering Gypsy figure appealed to the bohemian artists of the nineteenth century as a model from which to appropriate a new artistic identity, a phenomenon that was repeated again during the twentieth century but with the sensationalized African-American jazz dancer figure. With an emphasis on literary and historical representations of the marginalized exotic other in terms of the spectacle, nomadism, exoticism and witchcraft, this dissertation offers a cultural reading of the origins of Bohemian Paris as related to self-imposed marginality. This study analyzes the literary myth of the female Gypsy and jazz dancer figures in Victor Hugo's Notre-Dame de Paris, George Sand's Consuelo, Prosper Merimee's Carmen, Louis-Charles Caigniez's melodrama, La petite Bohemienne, Paul Morand's Magie noire and Josephine Baker's films, asking the questions: How were the myths of la Bohemienne and la danseuse de jazz appropriated as models of marginality for the self-exiled bohemian artist? How should we define the idealization of freedom for the Romantics and later the Avant-garde as exemplified by the myth of the marginalized other? How close to the original marginalized culture was this mythologized ideal? Comparative analyses of the bohemian artist figure in Theophile Gautier's Les Jeunes-France and Henry Murger's Scenes de la vie de Boheme further elucidate the bohemian artists' methods of appropriating this marginalized lifestyle. By examining the relationship between the myth of the Gypsy and the bohemian artist figure through close investigation of stereotypes, representations and applications in literary and historical texts, this study aims to shed new light on the ways in which countercultural identities and communities are formed and regenerated.",,,
923,"Local Places, Open Spaces: Creating Substantive Citizenship with Race-Neutrality","The following analysis is based on the emergent conviction that due to the presence of systemic racism, all governing regimes are racial regimes and so do not respond to racially subordinate groups in the same way they have historically responded to white ethnics. As a result, ethnoracially marginalized groups have had to rely on community activism to contest marginalization to an extent not experienced by their white ethnic predecessors. Yet the ability of such community groups to resist oppression is limited. Furthermore, and unlike in the past, ethnoracially marginalized groups now confront a ""post-racial colorblind"" society that delegitimizes group specific articulations of interest as inegalitarian race thinking. In doing so, the politics of ""race-neutrality"" perpetuates the status quo of white skin privilege. The question explored here is whether ""race-neutrality"" can help to create more meaningful spaces of belonging for ethnoracially disadvantaged groups. It is theorized that facially ""race-neutral"" policies aimed at promoting greater social, economic, and environmental justice may work as solutions to a group specific problem and facilitate coalition building with other progressive organizations. The ability to work in coalition allows for sustained mobilization increasing the likelihood of policy victory. Because local places provide the contexts that shape our everyday lives and vary in their resistance to the demands placed on them by ethnoracially disadvantaged groups, the study employed a case study approach to examine four instance of community based mobilization around ""race-neutral"" issues. The study examined mobilization around two divisive ""race-neutral"" issues under a resistant regime and two social justice oriented ""race-neutral"" issues under a comparatively porous regime. The study finds that divisive ""race-neutrality"" covertly works to reinforce traditional boundaries of belonging but that social justice oriented ""race-neutrality"" facilitated coalition building and enabled a community-based organization to achieve policy victories on ""race-neutral"" issues important to substantive belonging.",,,
924,Applications of data-mining in production test: Tools and methodologies,"Two applications of data-mining in production test are cost reduction and quality improvement. In production, the most costly test step is burn-in. Hence, eliminating or reducing the burn-in test is highly desirable. Test quality is essential for products in the automotive market that require a zero defective parts per million (DPPM) rate. In this thesis, we propose a test data-mining framework consisting of two phases. The first phase is for developing an understanding of test data and uncovering its important aspects such as systematic variations and anomalies. The knowledge learned in the first phase is applied in the second phase, where learning tools and methodologies are used to build test models that are applied in production. These models are similar to derived tests that can be used to replace expensive test steps or as complementary tests to improve the test quality. For the first phase, we develop three pattern mining methodologies for inter-wafer abnormality analysis. Given a set of wafers, the first methodology identifies wafers with abnormal failing patterns based on a test or a group of tests. Given a wafer of interest, the second methodology searches for a test perspective that reveals the abnormality of the wafer. Given a particular pattern of interest, the third methodology implements a monitor to detect wafers containing similar patterns. We address the key elements for implementing each methodology and demonstrate the potential based on experiments performed on a high-quality SoC product line. For the second phase, we study applications for burn-in time reduction and customer return screening based on two product lines designed for the automotive market. For burn-in time reduction, the experiment focuses on developing multivariate test models based on parametric test data collected after 10 hours of burn-in to predict parts likely-to-fail after 24 and 48 hours of burn-in. Applying these models will identify a large portion of all parts that do not require longer burn-in time, potentially providing significant cost saving. For screening potential customer returns, preemptive and reactive model building approaches are developed to identify potential customer returns during wafer probe testing. The preemptive approach selects correlated tests to construct multivariate test models to screen outliers. A reactive approach selects tests relevant to a given customer return and builds an outlier model specific to the return. This model is applied to capture future parts similar to the return. The experiment shows that each approach can capture returns not captured by the other. We demonstrate that both approaches can have a significant impact on reducing customer return rates especially during the later period of the production.",,,
925,Stress-Relaxation in III-Nitride Based Semipolar Lasers,"Semipolar growth orientations of wurtzite III-nitrides have fundamental advantages over the polar c-plane growth orientation for fabrication of visible long wavelength light emitting devices, e.g. light emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs), due to a reduction of polarization-related electric fields in the quantum-wells (QWs). This results in devices with higher radiative recombination rates and reduced blueshift in the electroluminescence wavelength with increasing carrier injection. Growth of semipolar heterostructures, however, will often result in dislocation slip on the inclined (0001) basal plane and the formation of misfit dislocations (MDs) at highly mismatched heterointerfaces. Dislocations have been shown to act as nonradiative carrier sinks in GaN and its alloys and can therefore be extremely detrimental to optoelectronic device performance if located in proximity to the active region. As a result, optical waveguide design for defect-free semipolar AlInGaN LDs structures is greatly constrained within the limits for MD formation. We propose a two pronged approach in the III-nitride LD epitaxial growth: Growth of coherently strained LD structure on highly inclined semipolar {30 31} growth orientation with high critical thickness for stress relaxation. Growth of intentionally stress relaxed LD structure on lowly inclined semipolar (1122) growth orientation with low critical thickness for stress relaxation.",,,
926,Coherent light-matter interactions of defect spins in solids,"The first half of this dissertation focuses on the coherent interactions of single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spins in diamond with light and uses this interaction to demonstrate a plethora of single spin control and measurement techniques. Based on the Faraday effect, a new and non-destructive technique to measure the spin state of individual NV centers via the polarization of interacting light was demonstrated. With this same spin-light interaction, light-generated unitary rotations of the spin along the energy eigenstate basis was also demonstrated, a result of the AC Stark effect. Through a theoretical framework, both Faraday and AC Stark responses are described and compared directly with each other, giving insight on unknown experimental conditions and sources of decoherence. By then forming a $\\Lambda$ system in the NV center optical excited state and coherently driving both optical transitions, the NV center spin could be directly polarized into any quantum superposition via coherent population trapping dynamics. By equally-detuning the optical driving fields from resonance, spin rotations about any axis were performed as a result of stimulated Raman transitions. Finally, by measuring the luminescence of the NV center during the CPT interaction, measurement of the NV center spin along any quantum basis was performed, a process which we call dark/bright-state projection. These basis-tunable techniques of optically-based spin control were then applied in succession to perform all-optical measures of NV center spin coherence. The second half of this dissertation focuses on the initial studies of and coherent interactions between new optically-addressable defect spin ensembles in silicon carbide. After detailing the optical and spin spectroscopy of six such new defects in 4H SiC discovered by Will Koehl, various measurements of spin coherence (T1, T2, T2*) for these defects are described, as well as their temperature dependence. Excitingly, the spin coherence times measured are comparable to those of diamond NV centers, motivating their study as quantum-coherent systems in solids. Optically-addressable, spin-coherent defects are then observed and studied in both 6H and 3C polytypes of SiC, and the results compared between polytypes. Enabled by the existence of multiple spin species in the 6H polytype, double electron-electron resonance (DEER) was performed between pairs of distinct spin species. Analysis of the DEER response set limits on the otherwise unknown spin concentrations and optically-induced spin polarization fidelity for these defects.",,,
927,Biomimetic Synthesis of Zinc Oxide Thin Films,"Biomimetic reaction systems, where small proteins and peptides assist in the growth of inorganic materials, has the potential for making complex structures that are otherwise difficult to achieve. Through the use of a new phage display procedure, we identify peptides never seen before in the binding of zinc oxide (ZnO). By altering the concentrations of these peptides, the morphology of ZnO nanorods can be controlled. Through the use of these peptides we form ZnO thin films on a variety of substrates including glass and flexible PET plastic. This is the first time reported that peptides identified through phage display can be used in the formation of a thin film.",,,
928,Embedded Photonic Crystals in Gallium Nitride: MOCVD Growth and LED Design,"III-Nitride light emitting diodes (LEDs), often combined with phosphors to fill in longer wavelengths of the visible spectrum, have become the preferred method to produce high-efficiency white lighting. These LEDs offer the advantages of lower electricity consumption, longer lifetimes, and no toxic components. One of the major barriers to maximizing the efficiency of these LEDs, however, is the total internal reflection of light at the surface of the LED, causing a large majority of the light to be trapped in the material and absorbed before it can escape. While current enhancement methods, particularly surface roughening and encapsulation, can increase the light extraction efficiency to ~80%, there is still room for improvement. We investigated the method of light extraction by air-gap photonic crystals (PhCs) that are embedded within the epitaxial layers of the LED during metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) growth using a new method that was developed for this work. Two device designs were fabricated and studied. These were the double embedded PhC LED (with an n-side PhC and a p-side PhC) and the thin-film flip-chip (TFFC) LED with a p-side embedded PhC. Both LEDs were characterized in angle-resolved electroluminescence, and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the TFFC PhC LEDs was measured in an integrating sphere. Angle-resolved data were compared with optical simulations of the structures. Efficiency improvements for TFFC PhC LEDs compared to reference devices without a PhC were found to be limited to 70% due to plasma etch damage---necessary to create the PhC but detrimental to internal quantum efficiency (IQE). Measurements on the double embedded PhC LED showed that the extraction length of guided light was very short: 21-39 mum. The high rate of extraction in this device contributed to its increase in vertical output power after embedding the second PhC, despite expected losses in IQE from etch damage and current crowding.",,,
929,Part One: Phenomenology of Textural Saturation in Music Part Two: A Portfolio of Compositions,"Part One: This research will focus on a description of the musical phenomenon the author calls textural saturation, which, in short, describes a musical texture containing a large number of musical elements in either the spectral, temporal, and/or spatial domains of sound. This musical situation puts the listener into a unique position in which the traditional hierarchies of foreground, background, and other groupings or parts of the whole are no longer obvious, and the listener is given the opportunity to make his or her own creative decisions about how and what to pay attention to. The author will look at previous research in perception in the area of auditory scene analysis as well as research on the subjects of the phenomenology of compositional structure. The author then connects these two areas of research by discussing the phenomenological connection between the composer and the listener in what the author calls textural communication. When textural communication contains significant barriers in the perception of texture within the work, intentionally created by the composer or not, textural saturation is present. It is the author's goal to explore the unique properties that this kind of listening situation creates.

930,Sulfur isotope fractionation accompanies dimethylsulfide disproportionation by Methanosarcina sp. strain mtp4,"Methanogens are a group of anaerobic microorganisms of the domain Archaea that produce methane as an end product of metabolism. Most methanogens reduce carbon dioxide or ferment acetate to produce methane, but a small subset utilizes other substrates for methane production. Methanosarcina sp. strain MTP4, a methanogen originally isolated from a salt marsh, utilizes methanol, monomethylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine as well as the volatile methylated sulfur compounds methanethiol (MT) and dimethylsulfide (DMS). With MT and DMS consumption, hydrogen sulfide, methane, and carbon dioxide are produced. In this study, closed system incubations of the methanogen Methanosarcina sp. strain MTP4 were conducted to quantify the stable sulfur (34S/32S) isotope fractionation during DMS consumption. Calculations show a sulfur isotope fractionation factor (epsilon) of about -8 per mil between the sulfur in DMS and that in the resulting hydrogen sulfide. The methanogens preferentially utilized DMS with the lighter sulfur isotope, thereby enriching unutilized DMS. These results provide further data that can be used to understand the biogeochemistry of sulfur and methane in anoxic environments.",,,
931,Perceptions from people in Southern Mexico about Wal-Mart,"This thesis is based on the question, ""What are people's perceptions in Southern Mexico towards Wal-Mart?"" Wal-Mart de Mexico (Wal-Mex) is Wal-Mart's largest country operations outside of the United States. The evidence of illegal complicity between top-level executives of the company with government officials could be evidence that the company is expanding despite decisions made to keep it out through community action. This thesis sought to find if people's perceptions reflected a negative opinion of the company, and if there is notable resistance to the company's expansion in the south of Mexico that has historically been a center for anti-globalization sentiment. This project employed mixed methods of data collection with interview and surveys employed as well as a review of existing literature that appears in the form of a corporate case study on Wal-Mart Corporation. The results of this project show that negative perceptions of Wal-Mart is confined to rural small business owners in the form of negative attitudes. Overall, this study found very little negative perception among people in Mexico towards Wal-Mart. Limited negative perception could be attributable to the company's success in portraying an image of corporate social responsibility or to the fact that the most critical opponents of Wal-Mex cannot afford to shop there. It should be noted that the sample of participants surveyed is too small to make broad generalizations about people's perceptions throughout Mexico. This thesis should instead be used to suggest certain trends that may be reproduced using more scientific survey methods.",,,
932,The Evolution of Claude Debussy's Writing Style through Songs and Piano Music,"A stylistic incongruity exists between Claude Debussy's songs and piano music in the first half of his life. Out of the eighty-five songs he composed, roughly three-quarters appear in his early period (1880-1893). Conversely, his solo piano works were almost non-existent before 1888 and did not reach maturity until 1901. This document studies representative works from his early, transitional, and mature periods to show a correlation between his songs and piano music at an approximate eight-year interval over several years. This allows us to trace his stylistic evolution and provide explanations for the delayed maturity of his solo piano music relative to other genres. Because Debussy's songs developed sooner than his solo piano music, we are provided a useful measuring stick for purposes of comparison, analysis, and development. Chapter two presents analyses of several of Debussy's earlier songs (Nuit d'etoiles, Beau soir, and Fete galante) and piano compositions (Premiere Arabesque and Suite bergamasque), establishing similarities across the temporal gap. Chapter three continues into his transitional period, specifically examining songs from the Ariettes oubliees (and Apparition) and the Images ( oubliees) for piano. I examine his mature works in chapter four. There, I demonstrate that the Proses lyriques song cycle and the Pour le piano for solo piano are not only stylistically related, but represent a culmination of their respective predecessors, sometimes borrowing directly from earlier works. Two trends emerge when surveying Debussy's songs and solo piano works: the incorporation of external features into compositions early in his career and the adoption of new compositional techniques later in life. The songs are representative of the former situation. Symbolist literature and baroque-influenced keyboard writing form the basis of Debussy's early output. The latter tendency to embrace other compositional styles, such as Wagnerian and Javanese gamelan, manifests itself in the piano works. However, trends in Debussy's song output directly influence his later solo piano works. The gradual inclusion of his songs' expressive imagery into solo piano works highlights Debussy's growing affinity with the instrument and provides a working timeline of the composer's stylistic growth.",,,
933,Structural order in additive processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells,"Considerable academic and industrial efforts have been dedicated to resolving scientific and technological issues associated with the fabrication of efficient plastic solar cells via solution deposition techniques. The most successful strategy used to generate solution processable devices implements a two component donor-acceptor type system composed of a (p-type) narrow bandgap conjugated polymer donor blended with a (n-type) fullerene acceptor. Due to the limited exciton diffusion lengths (~10 nm) inherent to these materials, efficient photoinduced charge generation requires heterojunction formation (i.e. donor/acceptor interfaces) in close proximity to the region of exciton generation. Maximal charge extraction therefore requires that donor and acceptor components form nanoscale phase separated percolating pathways to their respective electrodes. Devices exhibiting these structural characteristics are termed bulk heterojunction devices (BHJ). Although the BHJ architecture highlights the basic characteristics of functional donor-acceptor type organic solar cells, device optimization requires internal order within each phase and proper organization relative to the substrate in order to maximize charge transport efficiencies and minimize charge carrier recombination losses. The economic viability of BHJ solar cells hinges upon the minimization of processing costs; thus, commercially relevant processing techniques should generate optimal structural characteristics during film formation, eliminating the need for additional post deposition processing steps. Empirical optimization has shown that solution deposition using high boiling point additives (e.g. octanedithiol (ODT)) provides a simple and widely used fabrication method for maximizing the power conversion efficiencies of BHJ solar cells. This work will show using x-ray scattering that a small percentage of ODT (~2%) in chlorobenzene induces the nucleation of polymeric crystallites within 2 min of deposition, increases the orientational order of specific polymorphs, and promotes further crystallite nucleation over a period longer than 40 min after casting. In addition, three dimensional chemical maps derived from energy filtered transmission electron microtomography (EF-TEMT) are used to demonstrate that subtle changes in the chemistry of the polymer backbone, as well as the use of solvent additives, have dramatic effects on the types of phase separated structures that develop in two different high efficiency solar cell blends. Solvent additives are demonstrated to have the ability both to refine coarser than optimal microstructures and to coarsen finer than optimal microstructures.",,,
934,CSR and Sustainability in the Building and Construction Industry: Green Lease Case Study,"The effectiveness of CSR and sustainability performance in the building and construction industry has been challenged with their limitations, which include being decorative, hefty cost and unrealized value for investment. Being able to align the financial interests of tenants and landlord, Green Lease is explored in this paper as a progressive approach to drive substantial improvement by changing consumption behavior. Existing practice in Australia, UK and Canada are reviewed to provide background for Green Lease development. A key enabler for Green Lease - legal sub-metering - is identified for the program to succeed. A case study is provided under the framework of main Green Lease components: green features, sustainable management and financial incentive. It is the author's contention that the openness of electricity markets and sustainability awareness are two major obstacles for Green Lease to roll out in Asia.",,,
935,Examining and Predicting Longitudinal Trajectories of Behavioral and Emotional Risk in Students,"Educational researchers and practitioners are increasingly supporting universal screening as a method to identify students who are in need of behavioral and emotional support. However, there is little research conducted on how to effectively utilize screening results to inform intervention practices. This study examined how different variables relate to behavioral and emotional symptom change in upper-elementary students (N = 163) over the course of one year, in order to study what characteristics and interventions correlate with various patterns of behavioral and emotional change. Using longitudinal cluster analyses, students were grouped into four developmental trajectories (Consistently Low Risk, n = 38; Consistently High Risk, n = 50; Normal Risk - Positive Trajectory, n = 35; and Normal Risk - Negative Trajectory, n = 40) based on screening results from the student-report Behavioral and Emotional Screening System (Student BESS) from three time points. Means comparison tests were used to examine change among different types of behavioral and emotional symptoms (inattention, internalizing, school problems, and personal adjustment) within each of the four trajectory clusters. Results showed that the four types of symptoms demonstrated different levels of stability and change in each of the four trajectory clusters. In order to examine which variables predicted membership into various developmental trajectories multinomial logistic regression analyses compared the groups on parent education level, attendance records, English language fluency, academic ability, and in-school academic and social-emotional interventions. Only academic interventions showed to be a significant predictor variable for the Normal Risk - Positive Trajectory group. Implications for research and practice are discussed, in respect to recommendations on utilizing behavioral and emotional screening results to inform intervention.",,,
936,Examining the Relation between the Bullying Attitudes Measure and the Student Engagement in Schools Questionnaire Brief Version,"Bullying at school is a contemporary challenge for many students and educational professionals. Recent reviews have identified multiple measurement considerations and concerns related to bullying research. Presently, there is a dearth of psychometrically sound, multidimensional measures for assessing students' bullying-related attitudes. The purpose of the present study was to further examine the validity of the scores obtained from a new instrumentthe Bullying Attitudes Measure (BAM)-- by testing the convergent validity of the BAM with the Student Engagement in Schools Questionnaire-Brief Version (SESQ-BR). Student engagement is a well-researched and critical component to student success in schools. Thus, the relation between the two instruments would provide further validation for the BAM as an informative and meaningful measurement tool. A sample of self-reported honest responding students in Grades 7 and 8 (N = 609) was used to confirm the factor structures of the BAM and SESQ-BR. In addition, a structural equation model was conducted to study the relation between the two measures' latent factors. Modifications had to be made to the BAM and SESQ-BR factor models based on the study's sample. Both the measurement models had to be adjusted based on the sample. The overall relational model between the BAM and SESQ-BR demonstrated adequate model fit. Implications and future directions for further validation of the measurement model of the BAM are discussed.",,,
937,Know Thyselves: Theorizing Multiple Personality through Social Movements,"Contemporary scholarship in medical anthropology reveals the hegemony of the biomedical model of illness in the United States (Baer, Singer, and Susser 2003; Martin 1987). Health and normalcy are defined by medical institutions in their characterizations of disorder in medical texts and therapeutic protocols, and are affected by non-medical, public and private institutions such as those related to the mass media, religious organizations, social movements, and therapy. There are ongoing controversies surrounding the medical legitimacy of some illnesses, including Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), formerly Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), a U.S. ""culture bound syndrome"" that includes therapies and theories of causation outside the biomedical model. In the late 19th century, one of the most unusual ""abnormal types"" shares a similar symptom set with what the American Psychiatric Association (APA) now defines as DID (Ofshe and Watters 1996:4). Through participant-observation, interviews, and archival research, I explore the discourses and events surrounding the identification of DID/MPD since the 1950s. Using two case studies, I compare how the individuals, institutions, and discourses involved in these cases respond to broader changes in health care, political economy, and sociocultural processes in the U.S. This study is guided by three goals: First, to examine how the various key informants and institutions involved in the longstanding controversies surrounding the diagnosis of DID/MPD in the U.S. characterize this phenomenon, with regard to international standards of mental health; second, to analyze the role of social movements in the meaning and stigma attached to DID/MPD in the U.S., specifically, as a disorder that disproportionately effects women; and third, to study the significance of hypnotic, psychoanalytic, writing and ""talk therapies"" in the treatment of DID/MPD and in their relation to claims of scientific/medical legitimacy. This research contributes to scholarship in anthropology and the social history of medicine by demonstrating how medical diagnostic categories such as DID act as dynamic conceptual spaces for social movements. Deconstructing the cultural processes shaping the characterization of DID, I show how women's embodied and disembodied ""voices"" speak through the DSM to support ulterior social causes, lifestyles, and political systems that contribute to their stigmatization.",,,
938,Molecular Studies of Neurodegenerative Tauopathies in Animal and Cellular Models,"Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of heterogeneous diseases with diverse symptoms that progressively impair CNS function. Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and other untreatable neurodegenerative diseases share the histological presence of hyperphosphorylated tau intracellular inclusions known as neurofibrillary tangles. In the first chapter, we explored the use of kinase inhibitors in tau aggregation mouse models as a potential therapeutical approach. The diaminothiazole series of compounds we developed are potent inhibitors of tau kinases CDK5 and GSK3-beta. Lead compounds from the series have IC50 values in the nanomolar range, and lack toxicity in this therapeutic range. Neuronal protective effects and decreased phosphorylated tau (PHF-1) immunoreactivity were observed in two mouse models, 3xTg-AD and CK-p25. This treatment nearly eliminated sarkosyl-insoluble tau. A prominent effect was seen on the phosphorylation at Ser404. The treatment also induced the recovery of memory in fear conditioning assays. In the second chapter, we studied the cellular and molecular characteristics of a FTD/PSP cellular model. Induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) were obtained by four factor reprogramming of skin fibroblasts from a patient diagnosed with FTD/PSP who harbors an A152T polymorphism in tau known to increase the risk for disease development. Three IPSCs clones of this patient were differentiated to human neurons (hIN). Skin fibroblasts from a clinically healthy A152T carrier beyond the expected age of onset, and two control individuals were also reprogrammed to IPSCs and differentiated to neurons. These hINs matured in vitro for five weeks, and expressed neuronal markers such as betaIII-tubulin, MAP2, Synapsin I, tau and PSD 95. hINs from A152T carriers lacked axonal polarity, evidenced by the somato-dendritic presence of axonal proteins such as Synapsin I, tau and the axonal neurofilament antigen SMI312. The severity of the axonopathy correlated with the clinical evaluation of the patients. We aimed to explore the transcriptome of the hINs matured in vitro. Transcriptomes were obtained from total RNA and polyA selected RNA on the SOLiD platform. Mapping sequences were then analyzed for coverage of consensus coding sequences (CCDS) to determine expression levels. Gene expression was contrasted to mouse brain expression and HEK293T cells transcriptomes. Differentially expressed (DE) genes were then determined by comparing transcriptomes on the series of hINs, establishing a subset of candidates linked to the pathology of FTD/PSP.",,,
939,"Oligocene Rodents (Caviomorpha), the First Report of Fossil Mammals from El Volcan, Chile","A diverse mammalian fauna has been recovered from the central Chilean Andes at El Volcan (33 49' S, 70 08' W) providing new chronologically important material for the poorly dated host unit, the Abanico (=Coya-Machali) Formation. Only four radiometric dates of questionable reliability have been published for the section from which these fossils were recovered (Munoz et al., 2006). This thesis represents the initial effort to identify and describe elements of the El Volcan fauna. Four caviomorph dentitions were selected for study based on the quality of informative morphology preserved. These specimens were described, compared to closely related Oligocene-early Miocene genera, and identified to the lowest taxonomic rank possible. Three new caviomorph taxa have been identified (Cephalomys sp. nov., Erethizontidae Gen. et. sp. nov., Echimyidae Gen. et. sp. nov.), all more closely related to Colhuehuapian than to Deseadan forms. The fossil bearing horizons at El Volcan likely fall between Deseadan age and Colhuehuapian age between ~25 and 21 Ma. This paleontologically-based age estimate provides an independent test of the radiometric ages produced by Munoz et al. (2006).",,,
940,A hierarchical polymeric composite for energy dissipation,"A hierarchical composite for use in energy dissipation applications has been studied. The composite is designed to combine three desirable properties: low weight, high strength and high energy absorption. This is accomplished by using two constituent materials with different cellular architectures: a periodic lattice for strength and a stochastic foam for energy absorption. The goals of the work presented here are to understand (i) how the two constituents behave on their own, and (ii) how they behave within the composite. X-ray computed microtomography was used to investigate the patial deformation of the two phases when the composite is compressed. Results from this study revealed that the foam phase stabilizes the lattices, delaying strut buckling, and increasing the flow stress of the system. The addition of foam doubles the energy absorption per unit volume of the lattice, while only increasing its density by 22%. This indicates that, under quasi-static compression, the system benefits from synergy between the two phases. This study highlights a possible route for achieving both strength and energy absorption in cellular materials.",,,
941,High Valent First Row Metals and Metal-Metal Bonds Supported by a Ketimide Ligand,"Treatment of MCl2 (M = Mn, Fe, Co) with 4 equivalents of LiN=CtBu2 affords the four coordinate tetrahedral `ate' complexes [Li(THF)]2[M(N=CtBu2)4] in high yields. These complexes can be oxidized by 0.5 equiv of I2 to generate the M(III) `ate' complexes [Li(12-crown-4)2][M(N=CtBu2)4] in high yields. These complexes exhibit high spin, intermediate spin, and low spin magnetizations for Mn, Fe, and Co respectively. [Li(THF)]2[M(N=CtBu2)4] can be oxidized by 1.0 equiv of I2 to generate rare examples of neutral M(IV)(N=CtBu2)4 complexes in moderate to high yields. Thermolysis of M(IV)(N=CtBu2)4 (M = Mn, Fe, Co) complexes show the decomposition pathway to proceed through ligand oxidation and the formation of tert-butyl cyanide and tert-butyl radical. Lower valent metal products can be isolated for Mn and Fe yielding Mn3(N=CtBu2)6 and Fe(II)Fe(III)(N=CtBu2)5 in moderate yields. The addition of 0.25 P4 to Fe(N=CtBu2)4 followed by heating to 60 C yields Fe(II)Fe(III)(N=CtBu2)5 and PtBu3 confirming the formation of tert-butyl radical. Treatment of Fe(IV)(N=CtBu2)4 with acetylacetone (acac) fails to afford a heteroleptic Fe(IV) complex, but instead generates Fe(N=CtBu2)2(acac) in moderate yields. Additional protonolysis experiments indicate any disruption to the Fe(IV)(N=CtBu2)4 coordination sphere results in decomposition by ligand oxidation. Treatment of MCl2 (M = Mn, Fe, Co) with 2.5 equivalents of LiN=CtBu2 in the presence of 1 equiv of 12-crown-4 affords the dimeric `ate' complexes [Li(12-crown-4)2][M2(N=CtBu2)5] in high yields. In the solid state, these complexes exhibit short M - M distances indicative of metal-metal bonding interactions. Magnetic studies show strong anti-ferromagnetic coupling between metals for all three complexes consistent with metal-metal bonding interactions. Treatment of FeCl2 with 3 equivalents of LiN=CPh2 or LiN=Fluorenyl (Fluorenyl = C13H8) in the presence of 0.5 equiv of I2 affords the dimeric complexes Fe2(micro-N=CPh2)2(N=CPh2)4 or Fe2(micro-N=Fluorenyl)2(N=Fluorenyl)4 in high and moderate yields respectively. Though these ligands are very similar, in the solid state, the Fe - Fe distance in the N=Fluorenyl complex is 0.4 A shorter and indicative of an Fe(III)-Fe(III) metal-metal bond. The proposed Fe-Fe bonding is supported by solid state magnetometry.",,,
942,Dynamical conductivity of strongly correlated electron systems at oxide interfaces,"The Mott metal-insulator transition (MIT) in transition-metal complex oxides results from strong electron-electron interactions and is accompanied by a rich spectrum of phenomena, including magnetic, charge, and orbital ordering, superconductivity, structural distortions, polarons, and very high-density 2-dimensional interface electron liquids. Recent advances in oxide heteroepitaxy allow interface control as a promising new approach to tuning the exotic properties of materials near the quantum critical point, with potential application to technologies including phase-change electronics, high power transistors, and sensors. The dynamical conductivity of oxide heterostructures is measured using a combination of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and dc magnetotransport. The rare-earth nickelates RNiO3 (R = La, Nd...) exhibit a temperature and bandwidth controlled MIT in bulk. Measurements of the Drude response in epitaxial thin films provide quantification of the strain-dependent mass enhancement in the metallic phase due to strong correlations. Reduction of LaNiO 3 film thickness leads to additional mass renormalization attributed to structural distortions at the heteroepitaxial interface, and an MIT is observed depending on the interfacing materials in coherent perovskite heterostructures. The rare-earth titanates RTiO3 exhibit a bandwidth and band filling controlled Mott MIT. Furthermore, the heterointerface between Mott insulating GdTiO3 and band insulating SrTiO3 exhibits a 2-dimensional itinerant electron liquid, with extremely high sheet densities of 3 x 1014 cm-2. The dynamical conductivity of the interface electrons is analyzed in terms of subband-dependent electron mobility and the established large polaron dynamics in bulk SrTiO3. Additional confinement of the electron liquids is achieved by decreasing the SrTiO3 layer thickness, with attendant increase in the dynamical mass. Taking the confinement to its extreme limit, a single (GdO) + plane in Mott insulating GdTiO3 is replaced with a (SrO) 0 plane. This is equivalent to ""delta-doping"" the Mott insulator with an extremely high density sheet of holes. The transport and absorption in the resulting two-dimensional insulator are consistent with a simple model of small polaron hopping. A comparison is made to similar features in the conductivity of randomly doped Sr1-xGdxTiO3 films.",,,
943,"Not My Father's Tongue: Traditions, Mediations, and Conflicts in the Contemporary Vietnamese Novel in French","Following in the footsteps of the pioneering works of Jack Yeager, Nathalie Huynh Chau Nguyen, and Karl Britto, my dissertation focuses on present-day Vietnamese writers writing in French and addresses the conflicted ways in which these writers relate to Vietnam and to their postcolonial condition as ""Francophone"" writers. In order to account for the colonial impact of French culture and language on Vietnamese people, I first analyze colonial and postcolonial novels and argue that even if Vietnamese authors from the 1930s until the 1980s started forging a literature of resistance in French, they still used colonial motifs to represent Vietnamese culture. In my second chapter, I introduce contemporary writers, Kim Thuy, Kim Lefevre, Anna Moi and Linda Le and build a threefold theoretical framework based on Mikhail Bakhtine's concept of heteroglossia and James Gee's sociolinguistics theory of literacy. I contend that these authors' use of French mediates their access to a multidimensional space, blurring borders of cultural and linguistic identity. Elaborating on multiple sub-identities, I then analyze the works of the novelist Linda Le, which exemplify the heteroglossic and carnivalesque novelistic language, which Bakhtin analyzed in The Dialogic Imagination. I argue that her use of dialogism allows her to challenge social norms and give an aesthetic form to the experience of writing in exile. Finally, in my fourth chapter, I demonstrate the ways in which Anna Moi reconstructs Vietnam's colonial history, manipulates the figure of the ethnic Other, and performs hybrid forms of linguistic and artistic expression in order to oppose social, cultural, and ethnic boundaries, and insert Vietnamese culture and people into a narrative escaping the constraints of colonial representations.",,,
944,"Processing Problematic Interactions: Exploring the Relationships Between Attributions, Perspective-Taking and Evaluative Responses to Nonaccommodation","In the forty years since its inception, communication accommodation theory (CAT) has shifted from conceptualizing its core constructs of accommodation and nonaccommodation in terms of objective speech variables to conceptualizing them in terms of interactants' subjective experiences. This theoretical move implicates other variables: to be able to make predictions about outcomes based on interactants' perceptions, we need to understand the sources and/or antecedents of these perceptions. To address this issue, this dissertation sought to better understand the process by which attributions of (negative) motive affect social psychological responses to (non)accommodation; the potential influence of a speaker's group membership on this process; when and why over- and underaccommodation result in different evaluative responses; and, because attributions and inferences about motive necessitate imagining a situation from an alternative point of view, the relationship between perspective-taking---a construct not yet integrated into CAT's framework---and perceptions of both motive and accommodation. In three vignette studies, this dissertation found that speaker group membership, (non)accommodation condition, and whether the evaluation pertained to a speaker or their communication all influenced the nature of the structural relationships between inferred negative motive, perceived accommodation, and evaluative responses. The studies' results suggest that both inferred motive and perceived accommodation are important predictors of evaluative responses to communication adjustment in interaction, and that inferences about motive may actually be a lens through which perceived accommodation is judged. This dissertation's findings also provide further evidence that underaccommodation results in significantly more negative outcomes than overaccommodation, and show that this is not a result of recipients' inferences about speakers' motives. A new potential explanation is proposed: that we ultimately see more negative responses to underaccommodation because underaccommodation is a riskier proposition, both socially and communicatively, than overaccommodation. Finally, this dissertation also delineates how perspective-taking may be integrated into CAT's framework, and provides preliminary evidence that perspective-taking may not only influence, but also be influenced by, perceived accommodation, a novel assertion for both CAT and the perspective-taking literature. It concludes with a discussion of the theoretical implications of these findings, presenting a revised visual model and set of principles for CAT.",,,
945,Understanding turbidity currents interacting with complex seafloor topographies: A depth-resolved numerical investigation,"Turbidity currents-underwater avalanches- constitute a special class of gravity currents which can occur in environments such as lakes, submarine channels, and continental slopes. They represent a large-scale geophysical flow phenomenon that plays an important role within the global sediment cycle as they can transport O(100) km3 amount of sediment into deep-sea regions. In the present investigation, direct numerical simulations of turbidity currents interacting with complex seafloor topographies are carried out to study relevant properties such as front velocity, runout length, deposit profiles, mixing and unmixing of ambient and clear fluid. Towards this aim, first, a highly parallel three-dimensional code called TURBINS is developed and validated against several numerical and experimental results available in the literature. Subsequently, to investigate the influence of the seafloor topography on turbidity currents, bi-disperse currents produced by the so-called ""lock-exchange"" configuration are conducted. The results from three bottom topographies, viz. flow over a tall Gaussian bump (B2), over a shallow bump (B1), and over a flat bottom (FL), demonstrate the strong influence of the bumps on current properties. In all three cases, turbidity currents, initially, traveled with the same velocity. During the later stages, however, we observed a nonmonotonic influence of the bump height on flow properties such as front location and mixing dynamics, i.e. the currents in cases B1 and B2 travel, respectively, faster and slower than the current produced in case FL. Spatio-temporal information such as energy budgets and concentration profiles are employed to explain this nonmonotonic behavior. On one hand, the lateral deflection of the current by the bump leads to an effective increase in the current height and its front velocity in the region away from the bump. At the same time, taller bumps result in a more vigorous three-dimensional evolution of the current, accompanied by increased dissipation, which slows the current down. For small bumps, the former mechanism dominates, so that on average the current front propagates faster than its flat bottom counterpart. For currents interacting with larger bumps, however, the increased dissipation becomes dominant, so that they exhibit a reduced front velocity as compared to currents propagating over flat surfaces.",,,
946,The Content and Cost of Men's Pitch as an Aggressive-Intent Signal: Three Tests of a Retaliation-Cost Model,"Voice pitch is the perceptual correlate of fundamental frequency (F0) that describes how high or low a voice sounds. People differ in their habitual pitch level, but they can also modulate their voice to sound higher or lower in pitch. Research has shown that when men's F0 is manipulated to a lower value, they are perceived to be more likely to win physical fights than when their F0 is manipulated to a higher level. However, it remains unclear i) why lower pitch enhances men's perceived chance of winning fights (i.e., what the signal communicates) and ii) how this dominance signal could remain honest (i.e., how the correlation between signal intensity and whatever information it sends is maintained when the temptation to cheat is strong). Drawing on the retaliation-cost model, an influential model of animal communication, it is hypothesized that men's voice pitch influences their perceived likelihood of winning fights because it signals their aggressive intent and the honesty of the signal is maintained by a retaliation cost (i.e., men who modulate their pitch to a lower level risk physical confrontation from other men). If this hypothesis is correct, men who lower their pitch to address an offender in a conflict situation will be perceived more likely to aggress (H1), which will in turn predict their perceived likelihood to win a fight should it occur (H2). Further, if pitch modulation is a signal specifically designed to communicate men's aggressive intent, it should influence men's perceived aggressive intent independently of their condition (e.g., physical strength) (H3). Finally, men who use lower pitch in a competitive situation will be more likely than men who use higher pitch to elicit aggressive responses from other men---especially those who are physically strong and/or high in trait competitiveness ( H4). Experiment Set 1 tested and supported H1-3, and Experiment Set 2 supported H4. However, as a further test of H4, Experiment Set 3 showed a reverse pattern in terms of the effect of pitch level. The implications of these four sets of experiments regarding the retaliation cost model, research on men's pitch, and human aggression were discussed.",,,
947,Cell-surface display applications for characterization of antibody-epitope recognition patterns and antigen discovery in autoimmune disease,"Autoimmune disorders are a group of immune-mediated diseases which arise in an individual when their immune system inappropriately recognizes self-components as non-self components. Collectively, autoimmune diseases are estimated to affect 5-8% of the human population and world-wide prevalence is increasing for unknown reasons. Environmental factors are hypothesized to play a pathogenic role in the majority of autoimmune disorders but current tools are ill-suited for studying and/or discovering antigenic players in autoimmunity. To address this problem, cell-surface display methodologies were developed to understand relationships between antibody recognition and environmental pathogens in autoimmune diseases. A methodology for serum antibody epitope mapping using antigen fragment libraries was devised and implemented to elucidate autoimmune disease-specific epitopes present within a common environmental antigen. Specifically, the findings from this study strengthen the evidence linking Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA1) epitopes to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Multiple Sclerosis, but not Rheumatoid Arthritis, and suggest molecular mimicry between portions of EBNA1 and self-proteins may play a role in propagating these autoimmune diseases. This application serves as a new approach to examining autoimmune disease associations with ubiquitous environmental pathogens, which has been a long-standing challenge. To enable database-driven antigen discovery, a search strategy was developed to identify and expand linear peptide epitopes recognized by Celiac Disease patients' antibodies using randomized peptide libraries. Expansion of identified linear consensus epitopes possessed information content sufficient to unambiguously identify immunodominant epitopes in wheat, barley, and rye cereal grain proteins. Bacterial clones expressing the expanded epitope discriminated celiac and non-celiac patients (n = 78) with exceptional accuracy in a one-way blind test, yielding 100% sensitivity and 98% specificity. Since sequentially expanded epitope discovery (SEED) does not require a priori knowledge of the environmental antigens or organisms involved in pathology, it may be broadly useful for de novo discovery of environmental antigens that give rise to pathological immune responses.",,,
948,Power and Politeness in Intercultural Workplace Communication: Some Implications for Teaching English as a Second Language in Thailand,"Both educational and business sectors in Thailand are monitoring the social phenomena associated with managing the transition to a Thai-English bilingual society as the country is merging with other Southeast Asian countries to become a part of ASEAN community in 2015. The goals of this study are to explore how English is presently used in workplaces in Thailand and to suggest how English communication might be improved in intercultural workplace settings. This study employs an ethnographic approach; I conducted participant observation over the course of six months at two separate workplace settings in Thailand, both of which use English as the primary medium of communication and represent two major types of Thailand workplaces in globalized business contexts. The dataset consists of ethnographic fieldnotes and audio-recordings of naturally occurring conversations in the two different workplace situations: business negotiations and staff meetings. I take interactional sociolinguistic (IS) and pragmatic analysis as standpoints and discuss how Thai culture influences the discourse of participants in the two workplaces. The findings reveal three overarching aspects of Thai cultures influencing functional cultures in Thai workplaces: paying respect to social and institutional hierarchy, avoiding direct confrontation, and maintaining group harmony. In addition, indirectness is identified as the preferred negotiation style used by participants in the two workplaces. However, based on the data, indirectness was used more often in the staff meetings than in the business negotiation. The results therefore argue that the degree of direct and indirect negotiation style is not dependent on the cultural backgrounds of interlocutors or the culture of the wider society. On the contrary, the nature of the encounter, the relationship between interlocutors and the cost of negotiation are indicators that participants use explicitly and implicitly to determine the power differences and to choose the appropriate socio-pragmatic conventions to communicate in order to achieve their personal and organizational goals. Some pedagogical and research implications are provided as guidelines for future researchers, curriculum designers, and language teachers on teaching Business English courses and also teaching culture in the language classroom in the current and future time of the growing globalized economy.",,,
949,"Biophobia: Anxiety, Wildness, and the Horror of Nature","The contemporary discourse of environmentalism is held back by its use of problematic concepts such as ""nature"" and ""environment"" that indicate a pervasive biophobia within modernity. Biophobia: Anxiety, Wildness, and the Horror of Nature presents a conception of ""wildness"" designed to extend the critique of ""nature"" in recent ecocritical theory, including most relevantly the work of Timothy Morton and Dana Phillips. I argue that ""nature"" and ""environment"" exhibit and facilitate a repression of human anxiety about being a body in a world that exceeds our attempts to master it. They serve to alleviate biophobia through repressing the wildness of life by establishing stable boundaries for thought and action. The dissertation examines the literary production of British and American Romanticism to show how our current understanding of these concepts emerged out of a privileging of Wordsworthian nature. I argue that, against Wordsworth's biophobic domestication of wildness, P. B. Shelley's poetics of love and mutability, as well as elements of the gothic tradition exemplified by Radcliffe and Poe and the apocalyptic tradition arising out of Byron's ""Darkness"" and Mary Shelley's The Last Man, offer valuable aesthetic tools for overcoming biophobia and embracing the vitality of matter. I view the tradition of the sublime as an aesthetic containment of wildness, arguing that horror as an aesthetic mode is better suited to figuring it. As a result, I discuss contemporary environmental horror film, such as The Last Winter, Grizzly Man, Melancholia, and Antichrist , as expressing symptoms of biophobia and as a genre worth taking seriously as a means of promoting ecological thought. The dissertation situates these arguments in relation to ecocriticism, affect studies, and new materialism and draws on the theoretical writings of Derrida, Heidegger, Jean-Luc Nancy, Lacan, Slavoj Zizek, Alenka Zupancic, Jane Bennett, and Thomas Weiskel. Its key contribution is to promote ecocritical appreciation of the work of P. B. Shelley and the gothic, while recuperating the critical assessment of environmental horror in order to unlock its potential for understanding contemporary attitudes toward ecological complexity.",,,
950,Quantum control and engineering of single spins in diamond,"The past two decades have seen intensive research efforts aimed at creating quantum technologies that leverage phenomena such as coherence and entanglement to achieve device functionalities surpassing those attainable with classical physics. While the range of applications for quantum devices is typically limited by their cryogenic operating temperatures, in recent years point defects in semiconductors have emerged as potential candidates for room temperature quantum technologies. In particular, the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond has gained prominence for the ability to measure and control its spin under ambient conditions and for its potential applications in magnetic sensing. Here we describe experiments that probe the thermal limits to the measurement and control of single NV centers to identify the origin of the system's unique temperature dependence and that define novel thermal sensing applications for single spins. We demonstrate the optical measurement and coherent control of the spin at temperatures exceeding 600 K and show that its addressability is eventually limited by thermal quenching of the optical spin readout. These measurements provide important information for the electronic structure responsible for the optical spin initialization and readout processes and, moreover, suggest that the coherence of the NV center's spin states could be harnessed for thermometry applications. To that end, we develop novel quantum control techniques that selectively probe thermally induced shifts in the spin resonance frequencies while minimizing the defect's interactions with nearby nuclear spins. We use these techniques to extend the NV center's spin coherence for thermometry by 45-fold to achieve thermal sensitivities approaching 10 mK Hz-1/2 . We show the versatility of these techniques by performing measurements in a range of magnetic environments and at temperatures as high as 500 K. Together with diamond's ideal thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties, these measurements suggest that NV center sensors could be employed in a diverse range of applications such as intracellular thermometry, microfuidic thermometry, and scanning thermal microscopy. Finally, while the development of NV center technologies is motivated by the desirable properties of isolated defects in bulk diamond, the realization of many of these technologies, such as those using the spin as a proximal sensor, require a means to control the placement of NV centers within the diamond lattice. We demonstrate a method to pattern defect formation on sub-100-nm length scales using ion implantation and electron beam lithography techniques. The ability to engineer large scale arrays of NV centers with this method holds promise for a variety of applications in quantum information science and nanoscale sensing.",,,
951,Adult Learning in a Computer-Based ESL Acquisition Program,"This study explores the self-efficacy of students learning English as a Second Language on the computer-based Rosetta Stone program. The research uses a qualitative approach to explore how a readily available computer-based learning program, Rosetta Stone, can help adult immigrant students gain some English competence and so acquire a greater self-efficacy in their working lives. There is literature on self-efficacy and computer-based learning but not on how erudition on computers encourages learning in adult ESL students. This ethnographic research explores how teacher's classroom practice takes into account the varied educational and language competence backgrounds of adult students in an ESL setting and how using a computer program, Rosetta Stone, encourages these students achieve self-efficacy in language learning. I make use of my ethnographic observation notes as a teacher ethnographer, the student computer and language experience surveys, as well as the adult school demographic data available to the teacher. The survey responses are coded and grouped into two groups those with high and low computer experience and high and low English skills. A subset of students was interviewed by selecting the samples from the high and low groups. The morning classes are activity based and the evening classes are computer based leading to differing types of efficacy. The course was effective in different ways given these differences between morning and evening classes. The main finding describes how the majority of the adult students' perceived self-efficacy tended to increase when students gained a more varied language learning experience in a routine program. Considering the problem of computer-based learning efficacy in schools, the research regarding self-efficacy and computer-based learning technology is limited. The research presented here demonstrates only a small aspect of future research focused on ESL classroom structure. Finally, a last implication addresses the ways teachers in ESL adult classes adapt, transform, redesign, and teach their classes, which constitutes further development and exploration utilizing an empirical approach as to how studying English as a Second Language advances self-efficacy and adult ESL student employability while leading the students toward their vision of living the American Dream.",,,
952,"Transcultural Performance Disciplines: Embodying AfroAsia in Martial Arts Theater, Film, and Everyday Practice","This dissertation examines Black epistemologies and identity formations embodied in performance disciplines such as martial arts, jazz, dance within theater, film, and everyday practices from 1945 to the present. This project reveals how Black practitioners have appropriated Asian aesthetic practices in martial arts in order to redefine their own subjectivity and negotiate hegemony; how Asian Americans have appropriated the Black radical tradition through jazz and dance in conjunction with martial arts in order to announce an Asian American political consciousness and a critique of imperialism; how Black performativity emerges within the global circulations of popular culture through representations of Blackness from martial arts cinema to print media; and how performance disciplines are deployed as pedagogical strategies to subvert and reconfigure youth incarceration and the school-to-prison pipeline. The analysis makes visible a constellation of connections amongst Blacks, Asians, and Latinos whose transhistorical cultural praxis has placed them in relationship with each other across time and across space. By examining performance disciplines as moments of transcultural encounters, I uncover how historically marginalized people deploy performance as a tactic for political survival and transformation. Furthermore, I depict how Afro-diasporic experiences circulate internationally through a constellation of practices, histories, and identities offering opportunities for resistance and new epistemologies.",,,
953,Measuring and Monitoring Long Term Disaster Recovery Using Remote Sensing: A Case Study of Post Katrina New Orleans,"This research focuses on measuring and monitoring long term recovery progress from the impacts of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans, LA. Remote sensing has frequently been used for emergency response and damage assessment after natural disasters. However, techniques for analysis of long term disaster recovery using remote sensing have not been widely explored. With increased availability and lower costs, remote sensing offers an objective perspective, systematic and repeatable analysis, and provides a substitute to multiple site visits. In addition, remote sensing allows access to large geographical areas and areas where ground access may be disrupted, restricted or denied. This dissertation addressed the primary difficulties involved in the development of change detection methods capable of detecting changes experienced by disaster recovery indicators. Maximum likelihood classification and post-classification change detection were applied to multi-temporal high resolution aerial images to quantitatively measure the progress of recovery. Images were classified to automatically identify disaster recovery indicators and exploit the indicators that are visible within each image. The spectral analysis demonstrated that employing maximum likelihood classification to high resolution true color aerial images performed adequately and provided a good indication of spectral pattern recognition, despite the limited spectral information. Applying the change detection to the classified images was effective for determining the temporal trajectory of indicators categorized as blue tarps, FEMA trailers, houses, vegetation, bare earth and pavement. The results of the post classification change detection revealed a dominant change trajectory from bluetarp to house, as damaged houses became permanently repaired. Specifically, the level of activity of blue tarps, housing, vegetation, FEMA trailers (temporary housing) pavement and bare earth were derived from aerial image processing to measure and monitor the progress of recovery. Trajectories of recovery for each individual indicator were examined to provide a better understanding of activity during reconstruction. A collection of spatial metrics was explored in order to identify spatial patterns and characterize classes in terms of patches of pixels. One of the key findings of the spatial analysis is that patch shapes were more complex in the presence of debris and damaged or destroyed buildings. The combination of spectral, temporal, and spatial analysis provided a satisfactory, though limited, solution to the question of whether remote sensing alone, can be used to quantitatively assess and monitor the progress of long term recovery following a major disaster. The research described in this dissertation provided a detailed illustration of the level of activity experienced by different recovery indicators during the long term recovery process. It also addressed the primary difficulties involved in the development of change detection methods capable of detecting changes experienced by disaster recovery indicators identified from classified high resolution true color aerial imagery. The results produced in this research demonstrate that the observed trajectories for actual indicators of recovery indicate different levels of recovery activity even within the same community. The level of activity of the long term reconstruction phase observed in the Kates model is not consistent with the level of activity of key recovery indicators in the Lower 9th Ward during the same period. Used in the proper context, these methods and results provide decision making information for determining resources.

954,Himalayan Wintertime Climate Variability: Large-Scale Atmospheric Circulation and Regional Precipitation,"The future state of High Mountain Asia's (HMA) glaciers is of critical importance to water security throughout densely populated regions of Asia. Without understanding regional climatic influences, the prediction of terrestrial water fluxes is not possible. Glacier records in the eastern and central Himalaya (CH) yield some of the world's most rapid retreat rates. However, there are a number of steady state or positive mass-balance glaciers in the Karakoram and western Himalaya (KH) regions. The goal of this research is to investigate multi-annual variations in synoptic wintertime weather as a contributing factor to regional mass-balance trends. Winter Westerly Disturbances (WWD) are the primary climatic influence within HMA during the boreal winter. This research investigates variations and changes in WWD over the period 1979--2010 and relationships with extreme precipitation in the KH and CH using multiple datasets. It is demonstrated that extreme precipitation events occurring in the KH and CH are often spatiotemporally independent, suggesting differing behavior of WWD affecting each region. The wavelet power spectrum of 200hPa geopotential height anomalies is used to characterize the frequency and magnitude of individual disturbances and to distinguish synoptic scale variability through time. This analysis exhibits an enhancement in the strength and frequency of WWD in the KH and indicates an increase in local extreme precipitation events. In contrast, the CH is observed to experience weakening influence of these disturbances and consequently, a decrease in extreme precipitation. Additionally, peak melt season temperatures are observed to decrease (increase) in the KH (CH) during the study period. This study also investigates multi-annual variability of WWD and teleconnections with some known modes of climate variability affecting central Asia, including the Arctic Oscillation, the El Nino Southern Oscillation, and the Siberian High. Although there is clear evidence that these modes affect circulation and precipitation in HMA, their competing influences on WWD are complex and non-linear. These results suggest that a thorough understanding of WWD and their spatiotemporal variations are crucial to improve our knowledge of the hydrologic cycle within HMA as well as our ability to project the future status of Asia's water resources.",,,
955,The Impact of Parenting Interventions on Family Functioning for Women in Residential Substance Abuse Treatment,"This study examined the impact of a parenting intervention on child development, parenting ability, and family functioning in a trauma-informed residential substance abuse treatment program for women and their children. Recent research supports the inclusion of parenting interventions in residential treatment with this population of women, yet questions remain regarding what outcomes emerge as a result of these interventions. Factors associated with child development, parenting ability, and family functioning such as cumulative risks, abuse history, and severity of substance abuse were examined at intake, as were changes over time in these domains for program completers and non-completers. Data were obtained on 82 women and 107 children enrolled in an implementation of a multi-site study funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. With respect to improved parenting ability and family functioning, results from this study suggest that women gained from being engaged in treatment regardless of whether they successfully completed the treatment program or left prematurely. A woman's abuse history accounted for deficits in family functioning upon entry into treatment; however, women with and without an abuse history were equally helped by treatment. Qualitative analysis of the participants' responses indicated that learning healthy parent characteristics such as patience, appropriate boundaries, and relationship consistency were the most helpful aspects of the parenting intervention. Implications for practice, policy, and research are discussed.",,,
956,Towards Querying and Mining of Large-Scale Networks,"With the advent of the internet, sources of data have increased dramatically, including the World Wide Web, social networks, knowledge graphs, medical and government records. Oftentimes, relations exist among the entities in these data. Therefore, we observe structures in the data, but these structures are implicit, and not as rigid or regular as found in standard database systems. These semi-structured data are usually represented as large networks with labeled nodes and edges. Querying and mining of these linked datasets are essential for a wide range of emerging applications, such as viral marketing, web search, malware detection, image retrieval, and social networks analysis. However, the complex combinations of structure and content, coupled with the massive volume of these data, raise several challenges that require new efforts for smarter and faster graph analysis. My research interests span the emerging problems in large-scale, heterogeneous, semi-structured data, with a focus on querying and pattern mining in social and information networks using scalable algorithms and machine learning techniques. My research on largescale graphs could be categorized into two broad directions: (1) querying of large-scale networks, including heterogeneous networks, uncertain and stream graphs, and (2) pattern mining over large graphs. In the domain of querying heterogeneous networks, due to noise and lack of schema, structured methods such as SPARQL -- which require an underlying schema to formulate a query -- are often too restrictive. Without knowing the exact structure of the data and the semantics of the entity labels and their relationships, can we still query them and obtain the relevant results? In addition, how do we query uncertain graphs and streams? In the area of graph pattern mining, what graph features one should extract in order to build an accurate and efficient classifier over large networks? From the perspective of advertising and viral marketing, what are the top-k most interesting itemsets and the top-k most influential persons in a social network? In my dissertation, I shall discuss our effective and efficient techniques to solve these emerging problems associated with querying and mining of complex Big-Graphs.",,,
957,Dynamics and control in power grids and complex oscillator networks,"The efficient production, transmission and distribution of electrical power underpins our technological civilization. Public policy and environmental concerns are leading to an increasing adoption of renewable energy sources and the deregulation of energy markets. These trends, together with an ever-growing power demand, are causing power networks to operate increasingly closer to their stability margins. Recent scientific advances in complex networks and cyber-physical systems along with the technological re-instrumentation of the grid provide promising opportunities to handle the challenges facing our future energy supply. In this thesis, we discuss the synchronization problem in power networks, which is central to their operation and functionality. We identify and exploit a close connection between the mathematical models for power networks and complex oscillator networks. Our main contributions are concise, sharp, and purely-algebraic conditions that relate synchronization in a power grid to graph-theoretical properties of the underlying electric network. Our novel conditions hold for arbitrary interconnection topologies and network parameters, and they significantly improve upon previously-available tests. We illustrate how our results help in the analysis of large-scale transmission systems and lead to novel control strategies and their implementation in microgrids. Our approach combines traditional power engineering methods, synchronization theory for coupled oscillators, and control in multi-agent dynamical systems. Beside their applications in power networks, our mathematically-appealing results are also broadly applicable in synchronization phenomena ranging from natural and life sciences to engineering disciplines.",,,
958,The Epistemic Significance of Disagreement with Others,"This dissertation examines the question of when and whether one should adjust one's credence in a proposition when one finds that one disagrees with someone else that one takes to be one's epistemic peer ---that is, someone who is roughly as well-informed and intelligent as oneself. There is a spectrum of views that have been proposed in answer to this question. Steadfastness is the view that sometimes one need not adjust one's credence at all in such a case. Conciliationism is the view that you must always adjust your credence in such a case. And there are various forms of conciliationism that vary in their recommendations regarding how much one should adjust in particular cases. I critically examine the most prominent arguments that have been put forward in favor of versions of steadfastness and conciliationism. I examine arguments for steadfastness that take uniqueness (the view that a body of evidence can only support one doxastic attitude towards some proposition) as a premise, and examine arguments for conciliationism that take permissivism (the denial of uniqueness) as a premise. I argue that both types of arguments fail, and thus that the truth of uniqueness and permissivism does not directly bear on the problem of peer disagreement. I also examine arguments for the view that in some cases, when you disagree with someone you take to be your epistemic peer, you may favor your own opinion to some degree because you have some sort of epistemic entitlement to favor your own opinion. I argue that such arguments do not succeed. My take on the problem of peer disagreement is that there are too many variables in play to be able to say anything that is both precise and generally applicable about what the epistemically rational way to respond to peer disagreement is. To illustrate this point, I examine the question of how the evidence one has for thinking that someone is one's epistemic peer will bear on how one should respond when one knows one disagrees with an epistemic peer.",,,
959,Spanish-language Telenovelas and Turkish Soap Operas on Arab Television: Cultural Adaptations and Social Effects,"This dissertation examines how imported TV series, including Spanish-language telenovelas and Turkish soap operas, have been culturally adapted by the second Moroccan channel, 2M, and the Middle East Broadcasting Center, MBC. The cultural adaptation of imported TV shows has relied on techniques of censorship in which sequences are re-edited and dubbed into Arabic dialects. This has marked a shift from earlier dubbing practices into traditional standard Arabic. The tightening of censorship restrictions has occurred because of the increasing accessibility of imported television shows given that they can now be more widely understood in local dialects. The alteration of essential dramatic events in these original television programs has, in several cases, distorted the narrative intent. An analysis of this type of censorship provides insights into how interrelated forms of political authoritarianism in the Arab world govern broadcast media. My dissertation also examines the social effects of Spanish-language telenovelas and Turkish soap operas on Arab viewers. The appearance of Spanish-language telenovelas on Moroccan television has heralded a more consumerist worldview particularly among young viewers aged 18-34. Many of these fans have expressed their admiration for depictions of luxury as represented by fashion, mansions, and expensive automobiles. The success of Turkish soap operas on MBC have found its most receptive audience among female viewers, who have started demanding a less authoritarian quality of interaction from their spouses. Depictions of the caring way Turkish male protagonists interact with female characters, who are presumably Muslim as well, has been a significant context for social change. Also, young female fans have used social media platforms, such as Facebook, to voice their moral and sexual preferences in men, taking Turkish fictional characters as their model. Arab female fans in the online fan communities increasingly discuss cultural taboos pertaining to male sexual appeal and their own physical and sexual preferences in men, expressing their aspirations for change in gender stereotypes and sexuality.",,,
960,"And God Knows the Martyrs Authority and Self, Suicide and Martyrdom in Jihadi-Salafi Jurisprudence","Among the few major research projects to address the appearance of the jihadi-salafi creed ('aqida) and methodology (manhaj) over the last few decades, this dissertation argues that underlying jihadi-salafi thought is an ascetical turn revealing a previously unexamined relationship created by jihadi-salafi jurisprudents between classical and contemporary theories of jihad. This new conceptualization links the contemporary participants in the imagined jihadi-salafi global jihad with the earliest warrior-ascetics, as Thomas Sizgorich has called them, who fought on the frontiers of the nascent Islamic empire. By focusing on the 'aqida and manhaj of the jihadi-salafi movement and the formation of an ideal subjectivity within texts legitimating militant autocidal martyrdom operations (al-'amaliyyat al-istishhadiyya) penned by jurisconsults (muftis ) on the Minbar al-Tawh&dotbelow;id wa-l-Jihad, the dissertation uncovers how the jihadi-salafi interpretation of the law rearranges the basic objectives (maqas&dotbelow;id) of the Shari'a around the principle of maximizing general welfare (mas&dotbelow;lah&dotbelow;a). The emphasis placed upon cultivating an intentional renunciation of the world and relationship with the divine opens the possibility for theoretical conversations with theories of secularization and modernization as well as the writings of Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, Peter Berger, Talal Asad, and Gavin Flood, among others. The dissertation concludes by presenting a unique possibility for working toward a phenomenological critique of religious violence.",,,
962,A Type B Version of Thompson's Group F,"Thompson's Group F is a finitely presented infinite group which has proved a rich source of counterexamples for group theorists. We re-consider the group as represented by polygons in the Farey triangulation of the hyperbolic plane. Through this lens, the group is linked to the associahedra, an infinite family of convex polytopes first studied by homotopy theorists in the 1960s. By analogy with the type B associahedra, known as the cyclohedra, we define a type B version of Thompson's Group F, show that this group is contained in Thompson's Group T, and give finite and infinite presentations and normal forms by utilizing a quotient of the group which is isomorphic to T.",,,
963,Nanomaterial Synthesis Using High-Pressure Microplasma Jets,"Geometrically-confined hollow cathode plasma discharges, also known as microplasmas, have received considerable attention in recent years because of their non-equilibrium, high-pressure operating characteristics (e.g., Telectron >> Tion, Tneutral and high collision frequencies) are ideally suited for applications such as UV radiation sources, toxic gas remediation, O3 generation, and synthesis of aerosolized nanoparticles. However, microplasmas have not been exploited for thin film deposition, and very little is currently known about the plasma physics and fluid mechanics involved in flow-through jet type cathode geometries as well as how microplasma jet operation ultimately affects spray deposition processes. This dissertation focuses on the design, characterization, and use of capillary and slit-type flow-through microplasma jets for nanoparticle synthesis (Cu, Pd, Ni) and deposition of nanostructured metal (Cu, Ni) and metal oxide (CuO, PdO, NiO, Fe2O3, SnO2) thin films on a variety of surfaces. Microplasma operation (IV characteristics, supersonic flow dynamics, and excited state species) and its influence on material deposition processes (transport effects, flux uniformity, ballistic aggregation vs. diffusional phenomena, and film morphology) were studied in detail. Overall, this work demonstrates that microplasma-based deposition is a novel and general route to realize a variety of nanostructured thin film materials for applications in (photo-electro)catalysis, solar energy harvesting, chemical sensing, and opto-microelectronics.",,,
964,The bei-construction in Contemporary Mandarin: Function and Pedagogical Implications,"The bei-construction is one of the most important yet difficult grammar points taught in Chinese Second Language (L2) curricula. Previous studies have discussed its structural complexity and the learning difficulties revealed by interlanguage data. However, syntactical descriptions alone are not sufficient to address the challenge that learners face in grasping why and when to use this construction. My research addresses this challenge by using Halliday's framework of language functions and proposing a generalized description of the construction's function. As I show, the widely accepted ""Adversity Hypothesis"" is inadequate to describe the kinds of contexts that require the bei-construction. Based on my analysis of contemporary spoken Mandarin from the data I collected, this dissertation finds that the essential function of the bei-construction is to express nonvolitionality, and this generalization provides a unifying explanation that accounts for its logical, textual, and interpersonal functions. In order to address the kinds of problems students of Mandarin face when learning the bei-construction, this dissertation also identifies the errors that Chinese L2 learners make when using it. These errors occur in the interlanguage data, and analysis of them reconfirms that the construction's function requires more pedagogical attention. However, my evaluation of Chinese L2 textbook samples demonstrates that the current pedagogical design fails to reflect how native speakers use the bei-construction and fails to address the difficulties in learning its functions. In order to fill this gap, this dissertation proposes a sequence in which the function of the bei-construction should be taught in Chinese L2 curricula within the framework of pedagogical grammar.",,,
965,Virtue as Knowledge and Unity in Early Plato,"In early Plato, Socrates advances two theses regarding virtue. He suggests that virtue is a kind of knowledge, similar to the expertise involved in a craft; and he suggests that the five virtues (wisdom, temperance, courage, justice and piety) form a unity. There are two competing interpretations of Socratic virtue theory in the literature. The biconditional interpretation understands Socrates to hold that the virtues are 'distinct parts of a single whole,' each requiring a separate definition. On this interpretation, each virtue is knowledge of a different kind, and the virtues form a unity because they are inseparable---if one has possession of one of the virtues, she will necessarily possess them all. The identity interpretation understands Socrates to hold that the virtues are 'one and the same' thing, expert knowledge of good and bad. On this interpretation, Socrates rejects the idea that the virtues are distinct parts of a whole, and the thesis that 'virtue is one' is taken quite literally. I provide an interpretation that accommodates both readings, and reconciles the (apparently conflicting) passages that give rise to them. On my interpretation, the primary question of the early dialogues (what is virtue?) serves to introduce two distinct searches, a conceptual search and a psychological search. There are times when Socrates seeks to clarify the concept of a virtue. There are other times when he seeks to identify the psychological state of being virtuous. For Socrates, the virtues are conceptually 'distinct parts of a whole,' but they are psychologically 'one and the same' expert knowledge. In my treatment of the Protagoras , I show that this knowledge engages one's most basic desire for living a good and happy life. Virtue is an expertise concerned with measuring the value of things---measuring their impact on one's life as a whole. A close reading of the Gorgias reveals that this expertise is not wholly separate from the process of disciplining appetites. Undisciplined appetites lead to psychological deterioration, which means that the undisciplined agent will eventually become psychologically incapable of developing the expertise for living a good and happy life.",,,
966,"Understanding the Dynamics of Changing Land-use and Land-cover, Population, and Climate in the Chitwan Valley, Nepal","This dissertation addresses connections among climate variability and change, land use and land cover, and population at a rural case study site in the Chitwan Valley in south-central Nepal experiencing rapid population growth and change. Subsistence farmers drawn to the area since the beginning of settlement in the 1960's are the primary residents, many of whom in-migrated to Chitwan for the increased agricultural opportunities available in the valley compared to more rural areas of Nepal. However, the dependence of the population on rainfed and seasonally irrigated agriculture leads to a vulnerability to environmental change. This study begins with an analysis of climate trends in the area, finding increasing interannual precipitation variability, increasing minimum temperatures, and reduced dry season streamflow, all likely to have adverse effects on agricultural yields in the region. Using satellite and social survey data from the Chitwan Valley Family Study, a regression model reveals links between agricultural productivity and short-distance temporary migration in the valley. Finally, to integrate findings from multilevel studies of social and environmental change in the region, an agent-based model is developed, and used to examine the effect of reciprocal connections (feedbacks) between demographic change and land use. The model reveals that feedbacks between environmental change and individual-level demographic decisions can lead to significant differences in rates of population growth and land-use change. The study reveals the strong couplings between environmental change, individual-level decisions, and livelihoods in Chitwan, and suggests that managers must take a holistic, landscape-level view when setting conservation policy.",,,
967,"Sketch Practically Anywhere: Capturing, Recognizing, and Interacting with Physical Ink Using Commodity Hardware","When faced with complex design, analysis, or engineering tasks, novices and professionals alike attempt to better understand problems through diagrams, and a natural first step in this process is working on a whiteboard. Through their drawings, people can gain valuable insights into subtleties of design and analysis tasks, but once a diagram gains sufficient complexity, further progress becomes tedious (or even intractable) without the aid of a computer. Sketch recognition interfaces over the last few decades have sought to ease this barrier to entry through pen-based interaction, enabling users to directly sketch the structures they want to analyze, leveraging their previous experience with drawing diagrams. From circuit design, chemical analysis, and even 3D modeling, these applications have allowed people to more effectively utilize the power of computation in their everyday work. Unfortunately, despite providing a more familiar interaction style, interface hardware requirements mean that sketch recognition interfaces still go largely unused; desktop-scale pen capture displays presently remain largely relegated to CAD firms or art studios, with the whiteboard-scale equivalents, necessary for collaborative design tasks, being even more exotic. The goal of this work is to utilize common consumer hardware (webcams, smartphones, and projectors when available) to enable sketch recognition where people are already drawing: whiteboards, chalkboards, and even on loose paper. In service of this goal, we have created SPARK, the Sketch Practically Anywhere Recognition Kit. Our system enables a person to interact with real world drawings by recognizing meaning from images of hand drawn diagrams that are captured via a smartphone or a webcam, and by providing an interface through augmenting projectors or the phone's own display. The system is constructed in three parts: a stand-alone stroke-based sketch recognition framework, a module for extracting stroke data from static images, and finally a component to extract key frames from a video stream of an active whiteboard for interactive recognition. As evidence of our methods, we have created a series of prototype applications that exercise each module: SketchVis applies traditional, virtual stroke sketch recognition techniques to data exploration through charting on a whiteboard-scale interface. Our Turing machine app enables simulation of Turing machine diagrams drawn with physical ink through a mobile, explicit capture interface. Finally, the equation graphing application serves as a proof of concept exercise of the continuous sketch recognition of--and interaction with--physical ink captured with a webcam.",,,
968,Gathering data on Pn: Based linear systems and Veronese embeddings,"We develop techniques for collecting data pertaining to two open problems about projective space. In the first chapter, we generalize a method of Dumnicki for determining the dimension of linear systems of divisors based at a collection of general fat points in Pn . In particular, we show that by proving the existence of a certain kind of partition of the monomial basis for &gcy;( O Pn (d)), one can bound the dimension from above. We apply these techniques to produce new lower bounds on multi-point Seshadri constants of P2 and to provide a new proof of a known result confirming the perfect-power cases of Iarrobino's analogue to Nagata's Conjecture in higher dimension. In the second chapter, we calculate some graded Betti numbers for the Veronese module Mn,d arising from the dth Veronese embedding of Pn , starting from two different perspectives. First, we consider Mn,d as a toric module, and prove a duality theorem which yields an explicit formula for the last graded Betti number of M n,d. We also make some notes about toric Boij-Soderberg Theory which is relevant to graded Betti numbers of toric modules in general. Second, we consider the equivariant structure of the minimal free resolution of Mn,d under the special linear group, and outline progress towards applying a result of Ottaviani and Rubei for calculating the resolution.",,,
969,High-Field EPR for Studies of Structure in Biological Systems,"Electron Paramagnetic Resonance is a powerful technique for studying the local environment near a paramagnetic species. When coupled with the ability to introduce stable paramagnetic labels in a variety of biological systems, EPR becomes an important tool to unravel questions of structure and dynamics in biological systems. Because these paramagnetic species are introduced site specifically, EPR offers unusual spatial precision to address specific questions that evade other techniques. As with other kinds of magnetic resonance, EPR becomes more powerful at higher magnetic fields. However, in EPR expansion to high fields has been slowed by technical challenges of working at hundreds of GHz. This work expands the capabilities of high-field EPR through dual approaches. The first approach is to develop new methods for biological studies exclusive to high magnetic fields. For instance, a distance measurement technique is developed based on the temperature dependence of electron-spin phase memory times at high fields. Further, \\Gd is demonstrated as a spin-label exceptionally well-suited for use at high magnetic fields. In particular, cw EPR with \\Gd allows measurements of interspin distances up to 4 nm under less severe conditions than are typically necessary for pulsed EPR distance measurements. Additionally, pulsed EPR distance measurements with Gd3+ are used to elucidate the oligomeric structure of a membrane protein. The results strengthen the case for Gd3+ as a particularly useful probe for targeting complex, oligomeric systems, which tend to be difficult to study in other ways. The second approach is to eliminate the power restrictions of high-field, pulsed EPR through the use of UCSB's Free Electron Lasers as a radiation source to enable the highest power, pulsed EPR at frequencies over 100 GHz. The ability to manipulate and measure spins 50-100x faster than with other sources is introduced and the technical approach described. The intrinsic phase instability of the FEL source can then be eliminated through a post-processing routine, which recovers the capability for phase cycling using the FEL. As phase cycling can be used to dramatically reduce artifacts, and is a common technique in both EPR and NMR, this greatly expands the detection capabilities of the spectrometer. Together these approaches have allowed new capabilities for studying biological systems, particularly the ability to measure more complex systems, and closer to physiological conditions than otherwise possible. Beyond this, it is hoped these developments continue to spur efforts to realize mature, high-field EPR techniques and technology.",,,
970,The South Atlantic Coupled Variability and the South Atlantic Convergence Zone,"The dominant mode of coupled variability over the South Atlantic Ocean is known as ""South Atlantic Dipole"" (SAD) and is characterized by a dipole in sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies with centers over the tropical and the extratropical South Atlantic. Previous studies have shown that variations in SST related to SAD modulate large-scale patterns of precipitation over the Atlantic Ocean. Here we show that variations in the South Atlantic SST are associated with changes in daily precipitation over eastern South America. This study is based on observational and regional atmospheric modeling. Rain gauge precipitation, satellite derived sea surface temperature and reanalysis data are used to investigate the variability of the subtropical and tropical South Atlantic and impacts on precipitation. SAD phases are assessed by performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis of sea level pressure and SST anomalies. We show that during neutral El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, SAD plays an important role in modulating cyclogenesis and the characteristics of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). Positive SST anomalies over the extratropical South Atlantic (SAD negative phase) are related to increased cyclogenesis near southeast Brazil as well as the migration of extratropical cyclones further north. As a consequence, these systems organize convection and increase precipitation over eastern South America. Numerical experiments forced with prescribed SST anomalies showed that even though the Atlantic SST affects the position of the cyclone associated with the SACZ, the atmospheric response and precipitation patters over land were opposite from the observational results. On the other hand, experiments forced with prescribed anomalous driving fields showed that the atmospheric component of SAD plays a significant role for the right position and intensity of precipitation associated with the SACZ. SAD negative anomalies provide the low-level and upper-level atmospheric support for the intensification of the cyclone at surface and for the increase in precipitation over the land portion of the SACZ. Therefore, the numerical experiments suggest that, during ENSO neutral conditions, the SACZ precipitation variability associated with SAD is largely dependent on the atmospheric variability rather than the underlying SST.",,,
971,Individual and Cultural Differences in the Interpretation and Generation of Natural Language Descriptions of Spatial Layout,"This dissertation looks into how people acquire spatial knowledge from verbal descriptions of space and turn what they learn into accurate and precise mental representations. Certain personal characteristics, such as spatial abilities and native languages of people, were examined in detail to explain the variance in task performance. People in general were able to construct accurate and fairly precise mental representations of a regular space and an irregular space, though there were large individual differences among task performances. In a comparison of people from different cultures, Chinese participants built more precise mental representations than American participants on the same set of spatial estimation tasks, though the groups were similar in cognitive abilities. This dissertation also investigates personal preference patterns for verbal descriptions of a familiar environment generated by individuals. For each participant there were four types of verbal descriptions of a familiar environment to rank: the route direction exactly as written by him/herself; an expert route direction written by investigators following criteria of good route directions; a sample good route direction selected from participant-generated route directions based on criteria of good route directions; and a sample poor route direction selected from participant-generated route directions based on criteria of good route directions. Results showed that a person preferred his/her own route direction as compared to route directions generated by other people, without realizing it was self-written. This self-preference was so strong that it existed regardless of the quality of the self-generated route direction. Next to this preference, people did prefer route directions that followed already established criteria of good route directions. A further study showed that people did not prefer route directions generated by authors whose personal characteristics were the same as their own. Therefore, there was something special about self-generated verbal descriptions of the environment. In conclusion, people differ from each other significantly in the way they comprehend and generate verbal spatial information. Cultural groups differ as well, in that Chinese people tend to construct more precise mental representations of the environment they learn from verbal inputs than American people do.",,,
973,Secondary Mathematics Student Teachers' Questions and Responses in Whole Class Discussion: Influences on Instructional Decisions,"This study examined four high school mathematics student teachers' questions and responses in whole class discussion for eight weeks. Throughout the eight weeks, student teachers were teaching full time. With the use of video, interviews and written reflections the results make visible that student teachers attempted to ask questions that required students to explain their thinking. Early in the eight weeks, student teachers attempted to ask more questions that required students to explain their thinking, but over time, student teachers asked fewer of these questions. Results make visible that negative student responses to student teachers' questions influenced the decisions they made about the questions they asked.",,,
974,What Is Social About Social Media Users? How Social Media Efficacy Impacts Information Evaluation Online,"Social media comprise a dynamic and rapidly expanding resource in today's information environment. This study proposes the construct of social media efficacy, or a person's perceived ability to reach desired outcomes in the social media environment, and suggests that a person's level of social media efficacy can impact how he or she evaluates information found online. Results of this survey of adult Internet users in the United States indicate that users with higher social media efficacy, who are younger and more skilled at producing and consuming social media content, tend find information shared via social media to be more trustworthy and credible than those lower in social media efficacy. These efficacious social media users also rely more both on the opinions of others and on social media specifically when evaluating or verifying the information they find online, suggesting that they may be more prone to seek out and be influenced by input from others. Overall, findings from this study indicate that people exhibit different behavior and information evaluation tendencies depending on their level of social media efficacy, suggesting the future utility of social media efficacy in exploring variance in human behavior and attitudes about information online.",,,
975,Course Management System Interaction Analysis: A Study of Current Adopters of an Established Course Management System,"Course Management Systems (CMS) have been an integral part of higher education teaching and learning since the late 1990s. The rise of the CMS provided the promise of efficient classroom management, where resources could easily be distributed and a slew of additional online resources would ease the burden of classroom management. The CMS has been a great success in universities and colleges worldwide. Research has been conducted on CMS effectiveness and usage. However, much of that research has been dedicated to understanding Early and Middle Adopters of the technology, ignoring Late Adopters. Since the late 1990s the CMS has gone relatively unchanged, allowing for the saturation of a user base of higher education instructors. In 2011, the promise of a transformation in higher education technology, including the CMS, began. New systems are being built and distributed at a rapid pace. Research has documented how Early Adopters will interact with these systems; little is known about the impact on Late Adopters. This research project sought to better understand the current adopters of an established CMS in a higher education institution, why and how these users adopt and interact with the system, and how they interact with the system over their first session of instruction. Analyzed were the usage traits of sixteen apparent Late Adopters of an established CMS via survey, interview and course site analysis. Findings suggest that not all new users of an established CMS have traits of Everett Rogers' description of Late Adopters, users have similar traits and tactics during their first quarter of instruction, most users are influenced and rely on non-educational technologies for assistance, and these users were not an additional strain on support services.",,,
976,Rethinking Sustainable Development in South Africa Through An Integrated Biodiversity Conservation and Climate Change Adaptation Approach,"This thesis is concerned with an emergent sustainable development approach attracting appreciable attention among government and non-governmental actors in South Africa. Although this approach's distinct integration of biodiversity conservation and climate change concerns is in and of itself unique, this thesis pursues a more compelling explanation for its increasing popularity. This thesis contends, rather, that the present appeal of an ""integrated approach"" stems from its relevance to a wider set of socioeconomic aspirations and ulterior motives in South Africa's post-apartheid transition. Evident fascination with this integrated approach can be linked, moreover, to specific issues of topical interest in South African politics, including: geopolitical influence; poverty alleviation; and inclusive social empowerment through equal economic opportunity. While this paper mentions non-governmental understandings as an important point of comparison, its primary preoccupation rests with the significance state actors within the presiding African National Congress (ANC) leadership attribute to this integrated approach. Correspondingly, this thesis mainly intends to critically interpret an apparent disconnect between promise (e.g. political rhetoric) and practice (e.g. policy implementation) on part of the ANC government. As a supporting objective, this paper also confronts tensions within an integrated approach's central assumptions, such as the presumed compatibility between environmental sustainability and economic development. The identified promise-practice mismatch and contradictions in environment-economic couplings can be assessed through three dimensions of South African politics, specified by this paper as: legal-normative; economic; and ideological---accordingly, these three areas make up the body chapters organizing this paper's presented findings. Marshaling evidence from available scholarly and practitioner literature, government publications, substantive news articles, anecdotal observations, and stakeholder interviews, this thesis identifies several enabling and constraining factors impacting the fruition of an ""inclusive sustainable development"" model associated with an integrated approach. Findings imply that constraining factors outweigh enabling ones. Consequently, the analysis concludes that while an integrated approach offers vast prospects for just and socially desirable change in South Africa, its potential to positively transform environment and development ethics is seriously impeded by lack of government foresight and willpower in the midst of prevailing power considerations and turbulent domestic politics.",,,
977,Political Consumerism and the Expansion of Political Participation in the U.S,"Understanding the nature of political participation in light of changing values, social structures, and media systems is one of the fundamental problems in studies of political behavior. Boycotting and buycotting---which collectively comprise political consumerism---lie at the heart of this debate. Although 22 to 44 percent of people in established democracies engage in these acts, the topic has received little attention in the American politics literature. To increase our understanding of direct forms of participation, this project raises three main research questions. First, how should we conceptualize political consumerism as a form of political behavior? Second, is political consumerism is a substitute for---or complement to---participation in other activities? Finally, what motivates people to engage in political consumerism? To answer these questions, I designed a survey instrument and hired an opinion research firm to administer the survey online to a nationally-representative sample of 2200 U.S. adults. In contrast to other scholars who treat political consumerism as a singular act, I theorize and find that political consumers are not a homogeneous group because people who only engage in boycotts are different from people who only engage in buycotts. Although both acts are associated with postmaterialist values, education, and political interest, boycotters tend to be younger and have lower levels of political trust. In addition, engaged citizenship norms and environmentalism are associated with buycotting, but not boycotting. Finally, although boycotters and buycotters participate in politics more regularly than do non-political consumers, boycotters contact public officials and sign petitions more frequently than do buycotters. In addition, people who engage in only one type of political consumerism are different from people who engage in both. Dualcotters tend to be wealthier, more efficacious individuals who are ideologically-sophisticated but apartisan. Moreover, dualcotters participate in politics more frequently than do people who engage in only one type. Finally, engaged citizenship norms, postmaterialist values, and environmentalism are important for dualcotters, which differentiates them from boycotters but not buycotters.",,,
978,Synthesis and Characterization of Conjugated Polymers and Small Molecules for Organic Photovoltaic Devices,"Solar energy harvested directly from sunlight using photovoltaic (PV) technology has become one of the most promising ways to meet growing global energy needs with a sustainable resource while minimizing environmental concerns. Especially, organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have been attracting a great deal of interest as a source of renewable energy because of their potential as low-cost, flexible, light-weight and large-scale devices. The choice of materials in a BHJ solar cell is very important for device performance because the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are determined by their some crucial characteristics such as energy levels, charge transfer mobilities and structural orders. In this dissertation, two carbazole-diketopyrrolopyrrole based conjugated polymers (P1 and P2) and three thieno-[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) based small molecules (M1, SM1 and SM2) were synthesized and characterized to investigate their optical, electrical and photovoltaic properties. First, the substitution of alkyl and aryl side chains on the carbazole moiety of two push-pull conjugated polymers (P1 and P2) shows the significant differences in the optical, electrical and photovoltaic properties. Second, TPD-based conjugated small molecule with a donor-acceptor-donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D-A-D) framework, M1 shows the relatively deep HOMO level resulting the relatively high Voc.(0.85 eV) Small molecule BHJ solar cells were fabricated and characterized using different M1:PC71BM blend ratios, solvents, and additives and the highest PCE achieved in this study was 1.86%. Lastly, different bridgehead atoms of SM1 and SM2 can affect their energy band levels and device performances. The PCE (2.5%) of the SM2-based SM-BHJ solar cell was higher than that of the SM1-based SM-BHJ solar cell (1.5%).",,,
979,Development of Multiscale Spectroscopy Methods and Instrumentation to Probe Conjugated Polymer Solar Cells,"A key challenge in nanotechnology and nanoscience is to connect local physicochemical material properties with macroscopic behavior; in particular, it is still not possible to interrogate and image the local chemistry of a surface. Toward that end, this dissertation highlights the design and implementation of a multiscale spectroscopy platform for chemical and optical interrogation of thin films at the diffraction limit (~300nm) and below (10's of nm). Design and validation of the instrument are discussed with quantitative emphasis on confocal microscope operation, multi-functional spectroscopic imaging at the diffraction limit, plasmonic enhancement by the tip, and Raman imaging of nanowires. This work also includes several spectroscopic studies on blends of conducting polymer and fullerene, a mixture used for solar energy applications. In particular, this work employs bulk absorption, photoluminescence (steady state and transient), and Raman spectroscopy to connect the effects of processing (composition, annealing, solvent, etc.) with the micro-morphology of polymer solar cell films. Additionally, confocal spectroscopic imaging of charge transfer excitons and other emission processes in polymer solar cells is used to directly probe phase separation which occurs during film annealing. The methods developed within this work are a generally applicable, facile way to understand the micro- and nanoscale morphology of polymer solar cells and other material systems.",,,
981,"The Gospel of Judas, the Subversion of Royal Ideology, and the Generation of a Sovereign Self","The study that follows offers qualified denial of the interpretations of the Gospel of Judas that assert that Judas is simply doomed. It argues, rather, that the figure of Judas may be part of a tradition in which a Judas is a twin of Jesus, who ultimately unites with him in deification while their earthly shells are doomed to go through the motions of sacrifice. Judas' marginalization and even demonization made him a resource for those in liminal, stigmatized, and oppressed states. In the second half of the thesis, Judas, his fate, and their relation to Jesus are considered through a critical reflection---especially with Agamben, Foucault, and Bataille---on the problem of individual sovereignty in a deterministic world. Judas' ambiguous doom can be thought of in terms of Agamben's homo sacer, having been called into existence as such, in a sense, by Jesus' messianic sovereignty. Judas' theosis in the midst of his doom may be read as a Gnostic assertion of individual salvation that resonates with the existentialist solution to the problem of personal sovereignty in a biopolitical age.",,,
982,Deliberative street politics and sacralized dissent: morocco's 20 february protests and the jamaa al adl wal ihsane,"In the wake of uprisings across North Africa, Morocco's protests on 20 February 2011 offer a critical snapshot of the democratic potential of the street as a political venue. It is in the street that a variety of actors deliberate difference together, outside of state control and surveillance. Studies of democracy in the region often rely on liberal models that regard institutions as the key to a linear path to democracy. However, in authoritarian conditions these transitological frameworks are insufficient to explain the engagement of actors that are excluded from the formal political sphere. Rather, in viewing the 20 February protests as facilitating deliberative street politics, I investigate the integration (and exit) of the religio-political organization Jamaa Al Adl Wal Ihsane in an otherwise secular process. Interviews, participant observation and a historical look at the dialectical development of social movements break through the suffocating definitions of ""Islamist"" and ""secular,"" allowing breathing room for an analysis of articulation. With this approach, Al Adl Wal Ihsane's participation can be considered sacralized dissent, a form of protest that has been shaped as a response to state-sponsored sacralization of public space. Thus, the 20 February process takes on new meaning in its ability to sustain collaboration and facilitate democratic opposition to an authoritarian regime. This potential is crucial as Morocco enters a tenuous phase of economic crisis and unprecedented opposition to the crown.",,,
983,Reconstruction of heterogeneous snow water equivalent from MODIS imagery and energy balance modeling,"Snow water equivalent (SWE) and its heterogeneity are two essential variables in the hydrologic cycle of a mountain environment. The first chapter explores two different modeling approaches to quantify a basin's snow pack: (1) forward modeling with the snow energy balance model Isnobal, and (2) reconstruction based on potential melt from Isnobal combined with fractional snow covered area from MODIS imagery, carried on the Terra and Aqua satellites. Basin-wide SWE and its heterogeneity were modelled for four water years in the Marble Fork of the Kaweah River, a 152 km2 basin in the Sierra Nevada. Two components of the heterogeneity of SWE were examined: that owing to accumulation and that resulting from snowmelt. Heterogeneity caused by accumulation is represented by reconstructed SWE before the onset of melt. It is highest above the timberline, where wind causes redistribution and sublimation. Reconstruction accounts for the heterogeneity of wind-redistributed snow at the beginning of the melt season, even though it does not model the actual distribution processes. Thus it provides an independent method of measuring the spatial distribution of snow, which is useful to validate models of snow accumulation, either owing to redistribution or to precipitation itself. Heterogeneity caused by melt emerges from the calculations in Isnobal. Throughout spring it stays low above the timberline, while an increase occurs at the lowest snow-covered elevations as well as at the transition between forested and open areas. The spatial distribution of these trends persists in all four years of the study, but in the wettest year, 2006, the delayed onset of melt muted the heterogeneity. Forest cover is the dominating factor, with intermediate canopy cover causing the highest heterogeneity in melt. As input to the reconstruction model, fractional snow covered area from MODIS (fSCA) is corrected for missing data, periodic fluctuations caused by the satellite orbit, clouds, and vegetation cover. These uncertainties propagate into the reconstruction, and their effects on modeled SWE are treated in chapter 2. Two potential uncertainties are analyzed: a bias in fSCA that scales with vegetation cover and an offset in final melt-out date. While a positive bias in fSCA has little effect, a negative bias alters reconstructed SWE. Prolonging the melt season increases SWE more than shortening decreases it (4%-12% increase per day versus 3%-6% decrease per day). Chapter 3 presents an analysis of the spatial distribution of precipitation in the densely monitored Reynolds Creek Experimental watershed in Southwest Idaho. Elevation-detrended kriging yields interpolation surfaces similar to the PRISM precipitation model but is able to capture local anomalies such as rain shadow and topographic exposure. A comparison between summed hourly and daily precipitation surfaces illustrates the importance of interpolating precipitation at high temporal resolution in regions spanning the rain-snow transition. Otherwise, errors in the partitioning between rain and snow contaminate the daily interpolation results, when the elevation of phase transition varied frequently.",,,
984,Biomimetic Polymer Vesicles via Macromolecular Click Coupling,"Nature relies on self-assembly to generate biological membranes that utilize hydrophobic-hydrophilic interactions to assemble into bilayers and other structures. If we hope to mimic natural cellular architectures, the membrane is a key component. Polymeric amphiphiles offer an attractive synthetic alternative to biological membranes. Amphiphilic block copolymers are often the architecture of choice, and readily self-assemble into vesicles, micelles, or tubular structures under appropriate conditions. These polymeric nanostructures have been utilized for a variety of biomedical applications including drug delivery, nanoreactors, biomedical coatings, and virus-assisted gene delivery. Click chemistry has emerged as a powerful tool for the synthesis of well-defined polymeric architectures. Polymeric blocks may be clicked in a modular fashion, often in near-quantitative yields using equimolar equivalents of reactants. By allowing for the synthesis and characterization of individual blocks prior to coupling, well-defined polymeric amphiphiles are provided. Furthermore, the modular click approach allows for the systematic investigation into the effects of single parameter variations, such as block length or identity, on the resulting nanostructures physical properties or biological interactions. Although the click approach is a superb method for block copolymer synthesis, not all click reactions meet the stringent requirements for use in biomedical applications. This thesis explores the synthesis of siloxane-based amphiphilic ABA triblock copolymers using click chemistry. Our ultimate goal was to develop an optimal click methodology leading to biomedically useful polymeric vesicles. We sought to develop an elite polymer-polymer coupling methodology that is clickable, versatile, scalable, and biocompatible. Our initial efforts utilized the prevalent copper-catalyzed click reaction to provide a versatile and scalable route towards ABA triblock copolymers. These amphiphiles demonstrated the ability to self-assemble into polymeric vesicles (polymersomes) upon hydration. Subsequent in vitro studies demonstrated that even minute amounts of residual copper severely diminish pivotal stealth and biocompatibility attributes of polymersomes. A metal-free strain-promoted click method was developed that was versatile and provided biocompatible polymersomes, but was synthetically cumbersome and therefore not scalable. Thus, we developed an elite polymer coupling method using the nitrile oxide cycloaddition reaction that met all the requirements of an optimal macromolecular coupling strategy.",,,
985,Patterns of Brain Activity Associated with Successful Retrieval of Memories of Perceived and Imagined Events,"Memories of internally generated events (e.g., thoughts, dreams, imaginations) are encoded, stored, and retrieved similarly to memories of real events. In the present set of experiments, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine whether brain regions known to support episodic memory processes are differentially activated during retrieval of memories that were acquired through perception versus imagination. In three experiments, subjects perceived and imagined events in response to a cue word, and then after a delay made memory judgments about previously perceived, imagined, and new events. Experiment 1 demonstrated that regions of the left lateral posterior parietal cortex (LPPC) were more active during retrieval of perceived compared to imagined events, regardless of memory accuracy. Experiments 2 and 3 replicated this effect, and also provided evidence that observed source-based differences in activity could not be attributed to differences in the perceptual vividness of memories from perception versus imagination. And Experiment 4 demonstrated that source-based differences in activity occurred regardless of differences in response bias. Each of these experiments also revealed that successful retrieval effects in LPPC were source-specific. Correct recognition of old events was associated with a greater LPPC response than correct rejection of new events for items that were perceived at encoding, but not for those that were imagined. Combined, these studies suggest that the LPPC plays a preferential role in the retrieval of memories of perceived compared to imagined events, and this does not appear to be due to discernable differences in task demands or behavioral performance. Implications of these findings for both theories of functional contributions of LPPC to recognition memory as well as the neural mechanisms underlying our ability to discriminate the perceived versus imagined source of memories are discussed.",,,
986,Laboring for Global Perfection: The International Dimension of Mid-Nineteenth-Century Fourierism,"This dissertation examines the United States-based communitarian socialists known as the Fourierists as a piece of the larger international Fourierist movement, highlighting the numerous points of contact between Fourierists and their counterparts on each side of the Atlantic. My goal is to understand Fourierism as a multinational movement that sparked an international conversation among its members, which made it one of the most cosmopolitan of the reform movements to emerge from the social tumult in the 1840s. Its Janus-faced focus on the U.S. reform landscape and fixed connection with European Fourierists made Fourierism arguably the most dynamic reform movement of the nineteenth century. It is a story of connectivity among individuals who believed they possessed a new moral framework for remaking the world. The theories of the French social philosopher Charles Fourier also helped change the course of antebellum reform in the United States by introducing important themes and an entirely new vocabulary to the reform lexicon. The strength of the Fourierist press in the United States, especially the celebrated journal The Harbinger, highlights the movement's fingerprint on the course of American journalism. I will explore how and why this movement spread so far from the 1830s-1850s, and how these activists transcended national identity in order to realize the plan of perfecting the world's ills through the adoption of Fourier's experimental living arrangements. As a movement based on experiment, exchange, and collaboration, Fourierism intermingled freely with other mid-century reform movements including abolition, women's rights, free love, as well as workingmen's and other socialist movements. Traveling Fourierist leaders, the growth of Fourierist journalism, and the community of early Fourierists in New York City fostered complex identities in those at the heart of the movement. Their involvement in multiple causes demonstrates the international roots of mid-nineteenth-century reform. While adherents in each nation adapted Fourier's message to their own specific national context, the fluidity of the larger philosophy transcended borders, helping create an international reform identity in an age usually best known for a parochial nationalism. Using archival sources and published journals and periodicals from France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, this dissertation follows a chronological analysis of the movement's international layers. I examine the period from the movement's inception in the 1830s to its height in 1846, focusing on Fourierism's importation to the United States and its evolution from a cosmopolitan group of European and Francophone expatriates in New York City to a more Americanized version championed by Horace Greeley and Albert Brisbane with intentional appeal to workingmen. I also focus on the decline of Fourierism in the late 1840s, the pivotal year of the French Revolution of 1848, and the growth of the Free Love movement from Fourierism's ashes in the early 1850s. This dissertation compels scholars to look closer at the Fourierist movement as a case study in successfully changing the vocabulary of social reformers, bringing attention to the problems inherent within industrial capitalism, offering an inclusive approach to labor reform which included women's rights, and an alternative to the bourgeois home. Fourierism was at the center of a dialogue on gender norms and sexuality that would ultimately include members of the organized women's rights movement and advocates of the controversial free love movement. The Fourierist movement's communal ethos promised to improve the lives of women by ameliorating the drudgery of housework and providing shared child-rearing opportunities. Additionally, Charles Fourier's highly controversial theories on sexual liberation and marriage reform led some Fourierists to challenge reigning sexual mores. Studying the works of the Fourierists reveal new insights into the attitudes about gender and sexuality within the larger world of mid-nineteenth-century reform in the United States and Europe. Fourierism inspired a debate about gender, marriage, and religion that changed the language and tactics of mid-nineteenth-century reform.",,,
987,Spatial Stochastic Modeling and Simulation of Polarisome Formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Cell polarity is a classic example of symmetry-breaking in biology. In response to an internal or external cue, the cell asymmetrically localizes components that were previously uniformly distributed. Although cell polarity is an essential feature of living cells, it is far from being well-understood. Previous mathematical modeling has produced insights into generic mechanisms that can explain the formation and maintenance of polarization. The bulk of this work has relied on deterministic modeling. Using a combination of computational modeling and biological experiments, we closely examine an important prototype of cell polarity: the pheromone-induced formation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae polarisome. Our spatial stochastic model of polarisome formation is composed of a reaction network based on evidence from the literature, and we estimated parameters using our experimental data. We find that noise in the system results in a behavior we term spatial stochastic amplification , a phenomenon where increased noise results in tighter polarization. This model includes a putative role for a scaffold protein, Spa2, in stabilizing actin cables. We quantify, via experiments and modeling, both the dynamics and spatial distribution of the polarisome in various Spa2 partial deletions and find evidence supporting the existence of this novel function for Spa2. Simulating our polarisome model highlighted the need for efficient methods for spatial stochastic simulation. To that end, we have developed the diffusive finite state projection (DFSP) method. This method relies on taking interleaving steps of reaction and diffusion, and then solving diffusion efficiently with a finite state projection. As with many other approximate methods for spatial stochastic simulation, the DFSP method relies on splitting the reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) operator. However, because there has been no published method for estimating (and thus controlling) the error generated from splitting the RDME operator, we developed a local estimator for this error. This estimator allows practical adaptive implementation of many existing algorithms and opens the door to parallelization of spatial stochastic simulation.",,,
988,Targets of reputational attributions in foreign policy: A cognitive psychological approach,"Despite the abundant use of assumptions regarding state reputation in international relations research, few scholars have assessed the cognitive processes underlying reputational inferences. Deterrence theorists and political psychologists alike assume that decision-makers make unitary reputational attributions about other states, without regard for factors within states. I hypothesize that not all decision-makers make exclusively unitary-state attributions, and that the cognitive processes underlying reputations vary across individuals. Three cognitive factors relevant to reputational attributions--cognitive complexity, the need for closure, and out-group bias--have been shown to be correlated with political ideology. Therefore, I expect political ideology to be a systematic determinant of the location and dispersion of reputational attributions. Using an automated content analytic technique, I find that conservative decision-makers target and concentrate reputational attributions toward unitary states, while liberal decision-makers are more diffuse in their attributions.",,,
990,Engineering and Manipulating Single Spins in Diamond,"The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is a promising solid- state qubit for emerging quantum technologies, due to its long spin coherence time and fast manipulation rates, together with a level structure that allows for straightforward optical initialization and read- out of the electronic spin state . In high-quality single-crystal diamond at temperatures below 25 K, sharp zero-phonon-line (ZPL) optical transitions facilitate the coherent coupling between NV-center spins and photons. In this dissertation, I describe several experiments which explore the local spin environment around the NV centers along with a technique of electrically controlling their spin fine structure. We also take a bottom-up approach, by growing diamonds specifically engineered with shallow NV centers with long spin coherence times. The latter part of the dissertation explores two ways of manipulating the NV centers using all-optical control techniques, eliminating the need for traditional electron spin resonance devices and increasing the scalability and integration of NV centers into photonic networks.",,,
991,Development and Implementation of the Health Monitoring System for the Artificial Pancreas,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a metabolic disease in which the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are destroyed by the immune system, affecting up to 3 million Americans and increasing yearly. T1DM is manageable with exogenous insulin therapy but is extremely burdensome and can lead to long term complications and shorter life spans. The Artificial Pancreas (AP) is currently being designed to automatically control blood glucose for people with T1DM. The AP is designed as a multi-component system including several devices, communication systems, and algorithms. The safety of the system is extremely important, because insulin can be extremely harmful or lethal at high doses. As a process engineering design, the full AP must have several layers of protection to reduce the likelihood of severe adverse events. The Health Monitoring System (HMS) has been designed as a multi-module safety system for the AP. One of the most probable high-risk hazard of closed-loop insulin therapy is severe hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose, with symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, and coma or death of severe and prolonged. The Low Glucose Predictor (LGP), the first module of the HMS, was designed as an operator intervention safety layer to alert and treat for hypoglycemia. The LGP was integrated into the closed-loop AP system and tested in a 24 h feasibility study of twelve clinical subjects. There was an average of four alarms with rescue carbohydrates given per subject. The system successfully avoided hypoglycemia with no reference glucose values below the low hypoglycemia threshold of 60 mg/dL and no adverse events with symptoms. The Glucose Rate Increase Detector (GRID), used as a form of inferential control for hyperglycemia, was designed as the second module of the HMS. The GRID was tuned using clinical trial data with unannounced meals and tested in simulation with closed-loop control with large, unannounced meals. With the GRID, the amount of time spent in hyperglycemia was significantly reduced when compared to closed-loop control with unannounced meals. With both HMS added to the AP, control was tighter with less adverse events, effectively increasing the safety of the system while improving control.",,,
992,Soil-Landscape Modeling Of Coastal California Hillslopes Using Terrestrial Lidar,"Digital elevation models (DEMs) are the dominant input to spatially explicit digital soil mapping (DSM) efforts due to their increasing availability and the tight coupling between topography and soil variability. This coupling is often modeled using empirical relationships between soil and terrain attributes, an approach that assumes the scale and representation of DSM inputs is appropriate for characterizing soil-landscape relationships. However, soil variability is driven by soil and geomorphic processes blending at multiple spatial scales, and a physically meaningful specification of DSM inputs remains challenging. To improve these efforts, DSM techniques should integrate robust soil conceptual models with quantitative geomorphic tools that encapsulate scalable process-response dynamics. In service of this aim we implement a DSM study that embeds conceptual models of soil distribution in a quantitative geomorphic framework using fine scale (1 m) terrestrial lidar. Specifically we use commonplace terrain attributes to stratify a soil-mantled hillslope domain into pedogeomorphic subdomains following the catena model of soil development. Our study emulates a terrain segmentation model previously developed to extract and correlate hillslope catena positions with soil properties in a rolling post-glacial landscape. When implemented as published, the model does not translate well due to greater short-range topographic variability in our domain and high frequency spatial variability carried over from fine scale lidar data. To improve model portability and accommodate fine scale DSM inputs, we propose quantitative diagnostic tools for conditioning DSM inputs. The thresholds derived from these diagnostic tools are used to recast and condition an adaptive landscape segmentation model. Adaptive model outputs represent a bottom up statistical aggregation of fine scale terrain attributes with morphometric breaks conditioned by quantitative diagnostics of geomorphic process-response signatures. To the degree that geomorphic processes differ in their morphometric signals, these diagnostic tools may be used to compare geomorphic processes in tectonically distinct landscape, and correlate them with the occurrence and distribution of genetic soil types. In addition, the distribution and apportionment of discrete pedogeomorphic subdomains may be also treated as empirical categorical predictors of soil and ecosystem properties.",,,
993,Improving Decision Making During Wildland Fire Events,"Wildland fires continue to be a threat to persons and their property in many parts of the world, particularly in areas characterized as having Mediterranean climates, semi-arid climates, or boreal forests. Throughout the United States the policy on fires has been to extinguish all fires as soon as possible, especially those that are anthropogenically caused and/or threaten people and property. This has led to an accumulation of fuels in wildland areas and the alteration of natural fire regimes. The entities responsible for minimizing the impacts of these events are emergency management organizations (EMOs). In order to efficiently and effectively complete their responsibilities, all EMOs employ a variety of information processing technologies, including among others spatial decision support systems or geographic information systems, during the preparation, response, recovery, and mitigation phases of emergency management. However, EMOs continue to be plagued by issues that influence the effectiveness of their response during a fire event. This research explored the informational needs, data availability, communication flows, and decision making workflows informing fire decision support within current EMOs in order to develop tools that can improve decision making during a wildland fire event. By utilizing a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques, this research identified one of the most prevalent needs among EMO personnel, the need to know what impacts a firebreak has upon an active fire front, explored the relationship between firebreaks and wildland fire behavior, and developed and statistically validated a firebreak probability tool that has been integrated as a part of a wildland fire behavior program. The results demonstrate that by taking into account the needs and limitations of decision makers during an event, valuable information can be obtained that in turn can be used to inform the creation of improved spatial decision support systems used to assist decision makers manage wildland fire events.",,,
994,miRNAs as key regulators of corticogenesis evolution,"During evolution, the cerebral cortex has undergone tangential expansion and an increase in the number of cortical areas. Besides its extensive tangential expansion, the hallmark of primate cortex is the selective enlargement of the supragranular layer compartment that is considered to underlie the highly developed computational abilities of the human brain. Major non primate-primate differences in cortical development are underlined by differences in the dimensions, cellular composition and developmental timing of the germinal zones. The sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) enlarges along with cortical expansion and primates have evolved a specialized SVZ that is split into the inner SVZ (ISVZ) and the outer SVZ (OSVZ). The emergence of the OSVZ is arguably a key factor underlying evolutionary adaptive change in the development of primate cortex.The OSVZ of area 17 - the primary visual area- of the primate is highly developed and can be further subdivided into internal and external layers. We laser dissected brain regions from developing area 17 and 18 of embryonic day 80 Maccaca fascicularis and deep sequenced the microRNAs (miRNAs) in the germinal layers and in the cortical plate. Each of these developing anatomical regions could be distinguished by their miRNAs profiles. miRNAs which are present in primate and in some cases carnivore lineages, but not in rodent, contributed to the differential expression in the most recent anatomical innovations within the germinal zones. Prominent among the targets of these novel miRNAs, as identified by RISCtrap, were regulators of the cell cycle and neurogenesis. Co-evolution between the emergent miRNAs and the target was apparent. We conclude that multiple regulatory events involved in the control of neural precursor proliferation underlie the emergence of specific features of the cortex in primates.",,,
995,"Street Children's Children Pregnancy as a Street Exit Window for Street Youth in Mexico City, Mexico","This thesis examines the life histories of twenty four adolescent mothers who had lived on the streets of Mexico City, Mexico for a prolonged period (for more than four years) and came to the Mexican non-profit organization SEDAC for support with their pregnancies and children. Research subjects were categorized as having ""successful"" and ""unsuccessful"" street exits based on their ability to stay off the street and parent their children. Primary findings were that mothers in the ""unsuccessful"" category had experienced violence at a greater rate both in their families of origin and on the street and were also more likely to suffer from mental health problems, especially suicidal ideation. Also, the ""unsuccessful"" mothers were more likely to have migrated to the street at a younger age and to have used drugs for a longer period of time. There was not a significant statistical difference between the education levels, duration on the street, labor histories or age of drug initiation between the two groups. These findings were based on analysis of archival research of prior residents at SEDAC. In addition, the findings were fortified by ethnographic observations conducted by the researcher on the streets with Casa Alianza's street educators and within the resident shelters of Casa Alianza and SEDAC, as well as by interviews with personnel of both organizations. The chief practical finding of this research for social welfare agencies that provide for street youth is that a focus on mental health and recovery from trauma and abuse should be an integral part of efforts to help adolescent mothers transition off of the street and successfully parent their children. ,",,,
996,A 26-28-gbps clock and data recovery system with embedded equalization in 65-nm cmos for 100gbe,"A power and area efficient approach to embed a continuous time linear equalizer (CTLE) into a clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit for the next generation 100GbE system is presented in this work. The proposed merged CDR/equalizer system is implemented in 65-nm CMOS without extra power penalty, and achieves full-rate operation up to 28-Gb/s. Current-mode-logic (CML) with shunt peaking loads and customized differential pair layout are used to extend the circuit bandwidth. To minimize the area penalty, customized stacked differential inductors have been designed. These inductors achieve an inductance density 3.2 times higher than the standard single-layer design from the PDK library. The CDR/equalizer core occupies 0.33 mm. 2 and draws 104 mA from a 1-V supply. The measured BERof the recovered data is less than 10. -12 at 27-Gb/s for 2. 11-1 400mVpp inputPRBS data. The measured recovered clock and data rms jitter is 1.0 and 2.6 ps, respectively. The CDR is able to lock to inputs from 26-28-Gb/s with 2. 9-1PRBS pattern. The embedded equalizer enables the CDR to recover a 26-Gb/s 2. 7-1 PRBS data with BER < 10. -12 after a channel with 9-dB loss at 13-GHz.",,,

The extended pi-conjugated nature of these materials gives them a set of unique electronic and optical properties, and has lead to their application in a multitude of various technologies. Of specific interest is the application of these materials in various organic electronics applications, such as solution processed plastic solar cells, light emitting diodes, and field effect transistors. Herein is described the synthesis of a class of well-defined, highly active organometallic initiators for use in controlled polymer synthesis. The polymers prepared using the nickel based initiators in Grignard metathesis polymerization posses the following characteristics: rapid generation of high molecular weight polymers, low polydispersity, linear relation between monomer conversion and molecular weight growth, and the selective transfer of an initiating moiety from the organometallic initiator to one polymer chain end. This initiator was then used to prepare a new class of biosensor materials wherein the polymer had a well defined biosensing end group. Additionally, a series of small molecule donors have been developed that have shown promise in a wide variety of organic electronic applications. These materials can broadly be described as having a D'ADAD' type structure where D, D', and A correspond to electron rich and electron deficient aromatic heterocycles, respectively. By tuning the identity of these groups and the side-chains attached to them, one can subtly influence the optical, electronic, and physical properties of the materials. These materials were investigated via single crystal x-ray diffraction studies to gain insight into how changes to the molecule structure such as heteroatom regioisomerism and isoelectronic substitutions effected the molecular structure. These changes in molecular structure were then correlated to changes in the bulk, optical, and electronic properties. Finally, the single crystal x-ray structure of a high performing solar cell material was investigated via ab initio methods in an attempt to gain insight into why this particular material preformed so well in solar cell devices, and whether design rules for future small molecule semiconductors could be formulated.",,,
998,A Sign of the Apocalypse or Christendom's Ally? European-Mongol Relations in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries,"This dissertation is an analysis of how Europe responded to the Mongols in the thirteenth- and fourteenth-centuries. In only sixty years the Mongols created the largest land empire the world has ever seen. After Mongol attacks on Eastern Europe---specifically Russia, Poland, Hungary, and the Balkans---in the 1230s--1240s, Europeans were petrified of the terrifying and unfamiliar invaders. However, at times this initial anxiety waned and even turned to hope for a European alliance with the Mongols against Muslim powers like the Mamluks of Egypt. Using travel narratives of missionaries who traveled in Mongol territories, diplomatic correspondence between khans, popes, and kings, evidence of panni tartarici (Tartar silk) in Europe, theological treatises, and tombstones of Europeans who died in Yuan China, I challenge a secondary literature that tends to portray European-Mongol relations during this period as static. I show how European understandings of the Mongols varied greatly and depended on contemporary political events. I argue that medieval Europeans saw the Mongols as both threat and ally, as a sign of the Apocalypse and a partner in the fight against Islam. These sentiments were not mutually exclusive. This study contributes to studies of world history and understandings of pre-modern transnational relations. Its diverse sources illustrate the complexity of European attitudes towards the Mongols, and demonstrate how important an interdisciplinary approach is for the study of the Mongol Empire.",,,
999,An Experiment in the Aesthetic Value of Sonified Mathematical Objects,"A central problem in the field of aesthetics is the determination of what we find to be beautiful and why. Since the work of Adolf Zeising and Gustav Theodor Fechner in the mid-nineteenth century, there has been great research interest in determining the potential aesthetic merits of the golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence. A review of the literature shows that a large body of research exists that studies their aesthetic value in the visual domain. No research has yet been carried out, however, in an attempt to determine their potential merits in the audio domain. This has been due in part to a lack of suitable example stimuli for scientific testing. This dissertation takes the first step in bridging this research gap, guided by the question: Do sonifications of mathematical objects closely related to FS and GR hold some special aesthetic significance or advantage over less closely related sonified mathematical objects? In the most comprehensive survey of its kind, works in which composers are known to have utilized the golden ratio and Fibonacci numbers are shown to be unsuitable for our research purposes, as they were never intended for such research. Methods are then outlined for creating sonifications that can function as the necessary simple example stimuli in experiments. After a presentation of various sonifications related to the golden ratio and Fibonacci sequence, the methodology and results of a novel experiment involving 170 participants are then detailed. In this experiment, subjects were asked to compare the relative aesthetic value of pairs of sonifications of mathematical objects. In each pair, one of the mathematical objects was closely related to the Fibonacci sequence whereas the other was not. The evidence gathered suggests that the utilization of the golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence could have potentially negative effects on the aesthetic value of sonifications.",,,
1000,The Searching Self: Religious Autobiography in Pre-Colonial South Asia,"This dissertation investigates the ways in which the literary tools of autobiography are used to describe religious experience in pre-colonial South Asia. Arguing against a Western scholarly tradition that presents autobiography as a narrowly-defined genre produced primarily in the West and its colonial outposts, this project gathers and compares examples from a wide range of regional, linguistic, religious, and historical contexts in order to better understand what characteristics distinguish---and unite---these autobiographical expressions. We will also take three case studies---one Jain, one Sikh, and one Hindu---to illustrate some of the myriad ways in which South Asian religious autobiography functions. This is an important and timely contribution to the study of South Asian religions and the humanities in general for three reasons. First, our analyses illustrate the multiplicity of ways in which autobiography can convey religious meaning and are used to make specific kinds of religious claims. Second, we put Western literary criticism in conversation with South Asian sources in new and productive ways, particularly regarding issues of authorship, genre, and poetic technique. Finally, our data helps to dispel the notion that autobiography---and by extension, individual subjectivity---was a colonial import to South Asia. This project will begin with a discussion of autobiography as genre and technique, and a consideration of how that genre/technique is particularly suited to describing religious experience. Our second chapter examines a number of examples of religious autobiographical writing from pre-colonial South Asia in order to begin to form a picture of what autobiographical literature looks like in pre-colonial South Asia. Our third chapter is a case study of the Ardhakathanaka, the autobiography of 17 th-century Jain merchant Banarasidas, considering its uses of autobiography as literary technique and as polemic. Finally, we study two examples of what we will call the ""autobiographical pose"": works that are not, in fact, autobiographies at all, but that use the autobiographical voice. The cases for this chapter will be poems attributed to the 16th-century Hindu poet-saint Mirabai, and the 18th-century "" apni Katha,"" a work attributed to Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth and last personal Guru of the Sikhs.",,,
1001,Interstitial Religion: Approaches to the Study of Religion on the Middle Ground,"Social science research in religion seems to be losing sight of the middle ground where institutions and individuals interact and thus struggles to offer a constructive response to the dilemmas facing scholars of religion more generally. In response, this dissertation aims to bolster the efforts of those calling for an examination of the connections between lived religion and institutional fields. Viewing religion as a field or network visible through the interaction of individuals and institutions within it makes clear the object of social research and indicates a reflexive method for ethnographic research. Specifically, it is proposed that: (a) religion in general is a discursive field or network of communication and communicative action, definable only within its specific situation; (b) a ""religion"" in particular is a set of cohesive segmentary social networks characterized by discourse and communicative action in service of whatever is situationally defined as religious (most typically involving motivations and purposes commonly apprehended as related to the ultimate conditions of human existence); (c) lived religion, therefore, is empirically visible to the scholar solely through language and behavior by agents acting within those social networks; and (d) because of his or her active role in perceiving and interacting with and within the social networks that structure religious fields, the empirical scholar inherently and inevitably is a part of the field itself, which simply cannot exist without the relationship between the researcher and the object of study. These claims are illustrated with case studies using a variety of empirical methods; many underlying concerns remain the same regardless of how a particular situation is examined. Two cases (Japanese mizuko kuyo rituals and the True Love Waits chastity campaign) are based on analysis of primary and secondary sources, three others in ethnographic field research (Jews in postsocialist Slovakia, a ""Generation X"" church, and a Jewish seeker service), and one case (the Jewish emergent phenomenon) in a combination. The cases illustrate how to define and study religion empirically when it seems to be visible primarily in the interstitial middle ground where people articulate their sense of self and negotiate their relationships with one another.",,,
1002,Receiver and regenerator photonic integrated circuits for coherent optical communications,"Streaming media, mobile data traffic, and cloud computing are fueling the ever increasing demand for bandwidth. In order to meet this demand, the fiber optic communications industry is moving towards coherent modulation formats to increase capacity. Compared to conventional on-off keying modulation formats, coherent formats encode information in both phase and amplitude of a signal. Photonic integrated circuits have the potential to lower the cost of that comes with more complex transmitter and receiver components. Three different photonic integrated circuit technologies will be presented: a differential quadrature phase- shift-keying (DQPSK) receiver on the hybrid silicon platform, a coherent dual- quadrature receiver on InP with an integrated widely-tunable local oscillator, and a differential phase-shift-keying (DPSK) wavelength converter, also on InP. The wavelength converter has regenerative properties stemming from its the nonlinear transfer function, and has the potential to become a lower power alternative to a coherent tranceiver.",,,
1003,Having Adult Conversations About the Oldest Profession: Advocacy Tactics for Institutional Change in the Nevada Brothel Industry,"This paper traces a case study of advocacy tactics aimed at institutional change in the legal Nevada brothel industry. The brothel industry represents a unique case of legalized prostitution in the United States and the subject of debates about the institutional positioning of prostitution as an accepted service or an unaccepted vice. Specifically, the study considers the issues that give rise to institutional problems, the actors who advocate change, the audiences who can legitimate new organizational field arrangements, and the discursive tactics involved in entrepreneurial types of change. A single case study design that entails thematic and grounded theory qualitative techniques was applied to text data from newspaper articles. Analyses developed category schemes for each concept and theorized advocacy patterns in the case. The findings reveal that groups of actors use distinct sets of tactics to advocate pro and con sides in defining industry and prostitution problems. Confirming prior research, actors use institutional vocabularies to construct and position the problems. Findings also demonstrate how actors try to shift the field in relation to legitimate and illegitimate institutional arenas by locating the problem in the institutional field and creating urgency to act. Other patterns distinguish the institutional entrepreneurs from other advocates and identify the critical roles that certain audiences play in entrepreneurial processes. Such insights offer opportunities for continued theory building at the intersection of institutional theory and communication and speculations about potential change for the brothel industry and legalized prostitution.",,,
1004,Approaches to emergent spacetime in gauge/gravity duality,"In this thesis we explore approaches to emergent local spacetime in gauge/gravity duality. We first conjecture that every CFT with a large-N type limit and a parametrically large gap in the spectrum of single-trace operators has a local bulk dual. We defend this conjecture by counting consistent solutions to the four-point function in simple scalar models and matching to the number of local interaction terms in the bulk. Next, we proceed to explicitly construct local bulk operators using smearing functions. We argue that this construction allows one to probe inside black hole horizons for only short times. We then suggest that the failure to construct bulk operators inside a black hole at late times is indicative of a break-down of local effective field theory at the black hole horizon. We argue that the postulates of black hole complementarity are inconsistent and cannot be realized within gauge/gravity duality. We argue that the most conservative solution is a firewall at the black hole horizon and we critically explore alternative resolutions. We then examine the CGHS model of two-dimensional gravity to look for dynamical formation of firewalls. We find that the CGHS model does not exhibit firewalls, but rather contains long-lived remnants. We argue that, while this is consistent for the CGHS model, it cannot be so in higher-dimensional theories of gravity. Lastly, we turn to F-theory, and detail local and global obstructions to writing elliptic fibrations in Tate form. We determine more general possible forms.",,,
1005,Exploration of Graphene for Tunnel Devices and Electrodes in Next-Generation Green Electronics,"With the rapid scaling of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), the passive power dissipation is becoming comparable to the active power consumption. The passive power dissipation can be reduced by increasing the threshold voltage in MOSFETs at the expense of lower drive current and higher delay. An effective way to lower the passive power is to reduce the subthreshold swing (S), which is the amount of gate voltage required to change the device current by an order of magnitude in the subthreshold region. In this dissertation, novel applications of graphene in low-power and energy-efficient electronics are investigated. To that purpose, first the design of heterostructure tunnel FET (TFET) based on conventional materials including silicon and germanium is investigated. It is shown that while TFETs can exhibit S values much lower than the MOSFET's fundamental limit of 60 mV/dec, the ON currents of TFETs based on these materials remain well below that of MOSFETs. Then, the design of TFET based on graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) is investigated. The graphene nanoribbons offer several key advantages over conventional materials. These advantages include the tunable bandgap, the superb gate electrostatic control due to the atomically thin structure, the pristine surface, which reduces the trap density, the high carrier mobility, high thermal stability and high mechanical flexibility. Homojunction and heterojunction TFETs based on GNRs are proposed and their characteristics are investigated using the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism. The GNR based TFETs are shown to exhibit very high ON currents as well as S values down to 15 mV/dec. In addition, alternative devices and circuits based on GNRs are proposed and studied in this dissertation that can lead to ultra low-power consumption. A novel negative differential resistance (NDR) device (in the form of an Esaki Tunnel diode) based on GNR is proposed, which can be used in the design of ultra-compact memory cells. The proposed NDR devices exhibit high peak-to-valley current ratio of ~1E5 as well as high drive current of ~700muA/mum. The proposed device offers high flexibility in terms of the design and optimization, and is suitable for digital logic applications. A complementary logic is developed based on the proposed device, which can be operated down to 200 mV of supply voltage. The complementary logic is used in design of an ultra-compact bi-stable switching static memory cell. Due to its compactness and high drive current, the proposed memory cell can outperform the conventional static random access memory cells in terms of switching speed and power consumption. Finally, some key properties of graphene relevant to devices and interconnects in integrated circuits as well as to transparent electrodes in a variety of applications, such as contact resistance, trap state density and optical transparency are investigated. The contact resistance of metal to multi-layer graphene (MLG) structures has been investigated thoroughly by developing a rigorous 1D model. The model captures the effect of both the top-contact and edge-contact to graphene. It is shown that the edge-contacts reduce the total resistance of the metal-MLG structure by up to 2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, a self-consistent model is developed to capture the electrostatics of few-layer graphene (FLG) on semiconductors. The FLG is a promising material as a transparent electrode in various applications such as solar cells, touch panels, display light sensors and light emitting devices. The model predicts that the Schottky barrier height of the FLG/Semiconductor interfaces can be engineered to sub-200 mV. Furthermore, the charge density of FLG can be improved by a few orders of magnitude to improve its electrical conductivity. Lastly the role of trap states at the graphene/oxide interface on the current saturation of graphene FETs (GFETs) is investigated experimentally. Through carefully fabricated GFETs and systematically designed experiments, the physical nature of current saturation in GFETs is revealed for the first time. It is shown for the first time that the trap states in the oxide and at the graphene/oxide interface play crucial role in determining the nature of current saturation in GFETs. These trap states are shown to get charged or discharged depending on the bias conditions, and lead to the appearance or disappearance of current saturation in GFETs. The consideration of the effects of trap-states is shown to be necessary for accurate characterization, modeling and parameter extraction of GFETs.",,,
1006,Towards Understanding Signal Transmission in the Bacterial Chemotaxis Histidine Kinase CheA,"During bacterial chemotaxis, motile bacteria modulate their swimming behavior in response to environmental stimuli. At the molecular level, a histidine kinase, CheA, acts as an input-output element that couples sensory information to the swimming behavior of a bacterium. This thesis focuses on the signal transmission in the domains of CheA, including identification of the interaction site between CheA's regulatory domain and the cytoplasmic domain of chemoreceptor, establishment of the roles of two interdomain linkers in the signal transduction pathway, and the elucidation of how the interdomain linker that connects the dimerization and ATP-binding domains assumes its functional role. These findings extend our understanding of the chemotaxis signal transduction pathway.",,,
1007,"Aenschouwer, siet, hoe alle dingh verkeeret! Envisioning Change in the Seventeenth-Century Dutch Cityscape","This dissertation argues that pictures of changes occurring in seventeenth-century Dutch cities---burning, demolition, construction, renovation and social change---activated collective memories that viewers used to craft their personal, professional, and political identities. Physical urban change, both intentional and unexpected, was ubiquitous in the seventeenth-century Netherlands, and its pace and extent so great that change itself became characteristic of Dutch urban life. The dissertation challenges the predominant scholarly opinion that cityscapes are foremost expressions of pride. Falling outside many of the subject matter conventions of cityscapes, images of change often depict areas that are dirty, in chaos, or that no longer exist. Such images were related by artists and viewers to past political and social events through quotations of visual precedents and accompanying textual interpretations. Part I of the dissertation studies the city dismantled by fire and demolition. Chapter 1 analyzes Jan van der Heyden's Fire Hose Book of 1690, arguing that Van der Heyden's fire imagery recalls the horrors of war, and then combines image and text to provide the reader with a means of participating in protecting the city from such threats. Chapter 2 examines images of demolished buildings that allowed the viewer to position himself as a social ""insider"" by claiming a personal relationship to memories of the pre-change urban landscape. Part II studies the city rebuilt by construction, renovation, and social change. Chapter 3 looks at images of urban growth and renovation and argues that these physical turning points in the city's development gave artists and viewers the opportunity to attach meaning to the economic and aesthetic consequences of growth. Chapter 4 examines images of social interactions in the city, arguing that a variety of relationships to urban ""others"" could be asserted, from a socially distant acceptance to a restatement of the status quo that mocked one's social inferiors. The final chapter proposes avenues for further research, including the expression of time in cityscape imagery.",,,
1008,"Knowing where to look: The role of memory, attention, and response processes when implicitly learned context facilitates visual search","The task of visually searching the environment, such as looking for a friend in a crowd, is both ubiquitous and difficult. Visual search can be improved by learning the contexts in which a search takes place (Chun & Jiang, 1998, 2003; Chun & Phelps, 1999), and experimental studies have implicated multiple processes as being important to the benefit of implicitly learned context in visual search (Chun, 2000). To test the involvement of memory, visual attention, and response processing systems that may support these contextual cueing benefits in visual search, three experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 used signal detection theory (SDT) measures to index visual (d' measure) and response (natural log beta) stages during a contextual cueing task in which the target could be present or absent. The results from Experiment 1 demonstrated that visual processes appear to be enhanced consistently, whereas response effects were only observed when viewing time of the display was limited. To further explore the role of visual and response processes, Experiment 2 employed EEG measures of visual attention (N2pc) and response processing (LRP) in a standard contextual cueing task. Similar to Experiment 1, the visual attention measure was enhanced during contextual cueing, but there was no evidence of response enhancements in Experiment 2. In Experiment 3, the involvement of long-term memory and visual attention systems and their relationship in context learning was explored in a two session EEG and fMRI study. Participants performed a standard contextual cueing task in Session 1 while simultaneous EEG and fMRI was recorded, and a follow-up session with EEG recording was conducted 1 week later. As in Experiment 2, the N2pc attention measure was enhanced after learning in Experiment 3, and correlations between medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory region activity and behavior in both sessions is consistent with past findings (Giesbrecht, Sy, & Guerin, 2012). Critically, attention (N2pc) and memory (MTL) measures were analyzed jointly and resulted in evidence for MTL involvement in N2pc attention enhancements, which is consistent with the notion that memory and attention interact in contextual cueing (Chun, 2000). When considered together, the findings from these three experiments suggest that memory and visual attention systems are important mechanisms underlying implicit context facilitation in visual search.",,,
1009,Understanding State-Labor Relations in Morsi's Egypt: Moving beyond Islamic Narratives,"Two presidents have been disposed since the 2011 uprising, both largely the result of mobilization efforts from the country's labor movement. Though Egypt's current economic crisis is a main focus of international attention, President Morsi and the ruling regime's strategies to deadlock worker's reform initiatives remain largely unacknowledged. This paper provides two crucial explanations for this phenomenon that are insufficiently addressed by current social movement theories. The first concerns (1) the misrepresentation of the Muslim Brotherhood in current scholarship as a philanthropic organization and thus, an actor with interests congruent with the working/poorer classes, and secondly, (2) the regime's ability to suppress labor reforms while simultaneously instituting a facade of democratic measures to curtail criticism. I begin by providing an alternative narrative of the Muslim Brotherhood's trajectory that challenges a dominant framework prevalent with inaccuracies about their political motivations, and thus their relationship to social justice issues more broadly. Secondly, I offer an analysis of the regime's response to workers' strikes during Morsi's term in the current economic context.",,,
1010,"A Regional and Diachronic Study of Hunter-Gatherer Mobility and Mortuary Practices in the Salton Basin, Southeastern California","Human adaptation to the periodic infilling of Lake Cahuilla has been an important topic of discussion among researchers concerned with the archaeology of southern California's Salton Basin. In this dissertation, data from mortuary remains and associated habitation sites were used to investigate questions concerning hunter-gatherer adaptations to cyclical changes in ecological conditions in the basin. More specifically, this research explores the relationship between funerary practices and three broader issues: mobility, resource competition and social differentiation. Mortuary and settlement data contained in technical reports were compiled from 47 sites situated in the vicinity of Lake Cahuilla's ancient shoreline. The majority of the sites were located at the north end of the lake. For the settlement data, information was obtained on site structure, food remains, and types of artifacts present in middens. These data were then used to identify the type of settlement that may have been represented by cultural deposits. In terms of the mortuary data, nearly all of the mortuary features identified in the basin consisted of cremation remains. Data collected about these features included information on spatial location, physical structure of cremation facilities, and grave good associations. Skeletal data included age and sex of the deceased, total cremated bone weight, pattern of burning on bones, and bone pathologies. This information was used to define the distribution and organization of mortuary sites vis-a-vis settlement types. The results of this dissertation show that populations in the northern Salton Basin practiced both logistical and residential mobility throughout the period studied, regardless of whether a lake stand was present. Furthermore, the number of mortuary features occurring at a site was not a function of settlement type but rather of length and/or recurrence of use of a location. Examination of two formal cremation grounds demonstrated that these were established and maintained by corporate groups as a means of legitimizing use-rights of critical resources. The uniformity in burial treatment and the paucity of prestige goods accompanying the dead further indicated that these groups maintained an ethos of egalitarianism.",,,
1011,Concentration fluctuations of polymer solutions at interfaces,"The interfacial properties of inhomogeneous systems are most simply described by square gradient theories, which write the free energy as an integral over a functional of the concentration. In this thesis, we study concentration fluctuations in semidilute polymer solutions, in which polymers are overlapping in solution, using a modified (Cahn-de Gennes) square gradient theory. The Cahn-de Gennes theory incorporates correlations from polymer elasticity and has successfully been used in the past to provide mean field descriptions of interfacial energies and concentration profiles in a variety of solvent and boundary conditions. We begin by reviewing the bulk thermodynamics of polymer solutions and correlations due to polymer connectivity to motivate the form of the modified square gradient theory. We then set up the program of calculations and investigate the fluctuations in bulk, phase-separated solutions and in the presence of adsorbing and repulsive surfaces. Fluctuations exhibit particularly interesting behavior at adsorbing surfaces in poor solvent; their divergence at the onset of complete wetting, a type of surface phase transition, is related to capillary waves that are found at the free interface of two coexisting phases in the bulk.",,,
1012,"Fighting the Bank War: How Newspapers, Banks, and the Post Office Shaped Jacksonian Era Politics, 1828--1834","Andrew Jackson's conflict with the Second Bank of the United States (BUS), often portrayed as a ""Bank war"" involving questions of class, ideology, and personality, endures as one of the most significant political events in the antebellum era. In this dissertation, I offer a new interpretation stressing how national, public-private institutions---banks, newspapers, and bureaucratic agencies---shaped party development and public opinion. Reconceptualizing the Bank war, I focus on newspaper editors as central actors who helped craft the hyper-charged rhetoric of the Jacksonian era, as businessmen who blended public and private finance, and as crucial middle men who transmitted political ideas to voters. Amos Kendall, an editor and treasury department official who utilized state powers to build the Democratic Party and destroy the BUS, epitomized the lesser-known figures who gave the Bank war its distinct flavor. This approach contextualizes the Bank war within the transportation and communications revolution, and challenges the conventional understanding of the early United States as a ""weak state."" In assessing the power of the state, I am concerned principally with institutions and bureaucratic agencies like the Post Office, and how these agencies interacted with civil society, the press, and private enterprise. Leading newspapers in the Bank war, especially the Washington Globe and National Intelligencer, received subsidies from Congress and executive department agencies. The Post Office controlled a vast network of political patronage, hired editors as postmasters, and shaped public opinion by determining the speed and accuracy of newspaper delivery. The agency's power may have exceeded that of the BUS, which implemented a feckless, half-hearted, and inconsistent media strategy. Newspapers and letters comprise the bulk of this project's primary source base. Census records, philosophical treatises, legislative records, periodicals, personal narratives, autobiographies, price currents, bank balance sheets, and other miscellaneous sources provide accompaniment.",,,
1013,"Democracy, Dialectics, and Difference: A Critical Representation of the Hegelian Marxist Tradition","In 1985, Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe issued a serious challenge to the Marxist theoretical tradition with the publication of Hegemony and Socialist Strategy. Six years later, the collapse of the Soviet Union signaled the end of a nearly century long experiment with Marxism in practice. Both of these events ought to make scholars question the relevance of Marxist critique in the 21st century. This research looks at the work of activist and intellectual Raya Dunayevskaya in order to construct a response to both the current economic and political crises as well as the theoretical crisis that Marxist political thought currently faces. In order to do so, Dunayevskaya's work is compared with two of her contemporaries, C. L. R. James and Cornelius Castoriadis. It is argued that Dunayevskaya represents a unique tradition of libertarian and Hegelian Marxism that is able to respond to the dual crisis mentioned above. This is shown by 1) laying out a Marxist conception of the political that can compete with those offered by current non-Marxist thinkers; 2) claiming that Dunayevskaya and James are able to integrate the concepts of race and gender into their conception of democratic politics in a way that does not fall into the weaknesses of Marxism as theorized by its post-structuralist critics; 3) explaining Dunayevskaya's contribution to the understanding of Marx's appropriation of Hegel; 4) arguing that these facets of Dunayevskaya's thought offer an important contribution to Marxist, anarchist, and radical democratic scholars and activists in the context of current popular struggles.",,,
1014,The Effect of Flood Risk on Housing Choices and Community Hazard Mitigation,"This dissertation consists of three separate papers all pertaining to flood risk in the United States. The first chapter documents the changes in the frequency, severity and geographic concentration of flooding in the United States between 1978 and 2010. It also includes a review of relevant literature in economics and policy that will be referenced in two consequent chapters, paying special attention to papers that focus on the National Flood Insurance Program. I document evidence of an increase in frequency and severity of flood events over the last 3 decades nationwide. In the literature, I find a focus on catastrophic events and an opportunity to increase our understanding of the challenges faced by the National Flood Insurance Program by exploring the effect of an increased risk of flooding in a national context. The second chapter explores the optimal choices of housing and consumption inside and outside a flood plain in a general equilibrium context. It includes a two period model of housing, consumption and location decisions with endogenous prices and uncertain flooding. I explore how prices and allocations in each period adjust as I change the magnitude and probability of flooding, consistent with data that suggests that floods are becoming more frequent and severe nationwide. I conduct several experiments to analyze the welfare implications of government flood policy in this context. My results suggest that government intervention in the form of lump sum tax and state contingent transfer (similar to disaster assistance) can be welfare improving for a range of probabilities of flooding, but not for all. Furthermore, this policy reduces precautionary savings and encourages more of the population to live in the flood zone than socially optimal. The third chapter examines the relationship between flood risk, participation in the Community Rating System (CRS) Program, and insured flood losses. The stated goal of the CRS Program, which operates within the National Flood Insurance Program, is to encourage flood-prone communities to undertake a series of hazard mitigation efforts in order to lessen the impact of a flood. Does participation in the program lessen the impact of a flood in participating communities? Does the effectiveness of the program depend on the risk a community faces? Furthermore, does the program have a different effect when considering the repetitive loss information provided to CRS communities in 2006? The data shows that communities that participate in the program experience higher insured losses, as do communities with a higher flood risk as measured either by recent insured losses or property damage. However, I find that communities that undertake mitigation efforts are predicted to experience fewer insured losses as a function of flood risk and that both expected losses and the effect of mitigation vary by level of participation in the program. I also find that, after the repeat loss information was provided, CRS communities experienced fewer losses than was expected prior to the policy change.",,,
1015,The role of mind-wandering in measures of general aptitude,"Tests of general aptitude - such as working memory capacity (WMC), fluid intelligence (gF), or standardized admissions tests (e.g. SAT; GRE) - are thought to capture variability in crucial cognitive capacities that are broadly predictive of success, yet pinpointing the exact nature of these capacities is an area of ongoing controversy. We propose that mind-wandering is associated with performance on tests of WMC and gF, thereby partially explaining both the reliable correlations between these tests as well as their broad predictive utility. Employing complementary methodological designs, Studies 1-4 embedded thought sampling into tests of general aptitude and determined that mind-wandering was consistently associated with worse performance. Collectively, Studies 1-4 implicate the capacity to avoid mind-wandering during demanding tasks as a potentially important source of success on measures of general aptitude. Accordingly, Studies 5-7 investigated whether mindfulness training would reduce mind-wandering and thereby enhancing performance on tests of general aptitude. The results indicate that brief mindfulness exercises can reduce mind-wandering in at least some task contexts. Furthermore, two-weeks of mindfulness training program improved WMC and reading comprehension, while simultaneously reducing the occurrence of distracting thoughts during these tasks.",,,
1016,Single-molecule manipulation measurements of polymer/solution interactions,"Because the properties of soft materials emerge from the physics of the constituent polymers, we are motivated to characterize chain molecules at a fundamental level. We build upon the magnetic tweezers single-molecule manipulation technique, which involves measuring the distance between the ends of a polymer in real time and with nanometer precision while applying stable magnetic stretching forces in the piconewton range. Here we demonstrate new applications of this technique, specifically by measuring the interactions between a polymer and the surrounding solvent. First, through low-force elastic measurements, we determine a range of fundamental parameters that quantify solvent quality and chain structure. We present a force-solvent phase diagram to summarize these parameters and our experimental data, and discuss where PEG, DNA, RNA, and proteins fit into the diagram. The unstructured and structured states of a biomolecule reside at opposite ends of the diagram, indicating that folding is accompanied by a change in the character of the solvent. We therefore chose to investigate the local solvent change that occurs when a charged biomolecule folds. We present a thermodynamic framework for measuring the uptake of counterions that accompanies nucleic acid folding. Our measurements of a simple DNA hairpin identify potential shortcomings in thermodynamic parameters of MFOLD, the most widely used predictive software for nucleic acids. Finally, we present a variety of polymer immobilization schemes, achieve low-noise measurements with a strong magnet design, identify new assays, and provide technical guidance that may be useful to those interested in pursuing future magnetic tweezers experiments.",,,
1017,A Journey Through the Chemistry of Reactive Intermediates: From a Trimethylenemethane Diyl to Electrochemically-Generated Radical Ions,"Reactive intermediates, such as those derived from trimethylenemethane (TMM) diyls or electrochemically-generated radical ions, provide a versatile platform for exploring a wide variety of unique and interesting chemistries. A particular emphasis is placed on gaining a fundamental understanding of these intermediates through (a) mechanistic investigations or (b) method development, both of which are discussed herein. Unlike the reaction of aryl-substituted diazenes, pyrolysis of alkyl-substituted diazenes in the presence of molecular oxygen generates an unexpectedly complex product mixture. Using deuterium labeling studies, in conjunction with quantum calculations, a reasonable mechanistic hypothesis for the decomposition of the resultant [3.3.0] peroxide, and subsequent formation of the keto-alcohol and Z-configured alpha,beta-unsaturated keto-aldehyde, is proposed. Surprisingly, molecule-assisted homolysis plays a key role in this transformation, the details of which are discussed. While fulvenes have a rich history taking advantage of their aromatic and olefinic characteristics, very little is known about the electrochemical properties of these compounds. One interesting aspect of their electrochemical behavior--the elecroreductive cyclization of a fulvene tethered to an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester--is examined. In particular, the details concerning directed product formation via temperature control and concentration effects toward dimerization, or toward cyclization through a variation of the length of the tether joining the fulvene core to the second electrophore are discussed. Indirect electron transfer using electrochemical mediators allows many reactions to be run under milder redox conditions, e.g. requiring less total energy consumption. Unfortunately, in the majority of cases the mediators can't be recovered; therefore a recoverable mediator source would be both economically and ecologically attractive. Taking advantage of a generally underappreciated tool in organic electrochemistry, viz., the electrode surface, progress towards the modification of electrode surfaces with mediator-functionalized terthiophene polymers is presented. The aim of the investigation is to provide a method to recover and reuse electrochemical mediators, and thus a sustainable alternative to traditional mediated electrochemistry. One application of interest that will be explored is the anodic oxidative degradation of lignin model compounds.",,,
1018,Living Local in Global Climate Change: Drought and Poverty in California's San Joaquin Valley,"Climate change has a disproportionate impact on the poor. As the effects of climate change become more prevalent, the impacts on the most impoverished and vulnerable peoples will become more extreme and unpredictable. These impacts have policy implications and social costs both in terms of addressing how we mitigate climate change and how we address poverty. California's San Joaquin Valley is both a literal and figurative hotspot for the intersection of impacts created by global climate change and local policies ranging from water management to poverty mitigation. Combining climate change with a region already suffering from environmental degradation and a lackluster program for aiding those who are most socioeconomically vulnerable creates a perfect storm with potentially devastating and wide-reaching consequences.",,,
1019,Courses in Culture: The Acceptance of Music in the Late-Nineteenth-Century American University,"This dissertation explores how music came to be accepted in late-nineteenth-century American university curricula as an element of what historian Laurence Veysey has called the liberal culture reform movement. Proponents of liberal culture focused on advancing the classically derived studies of language, philosophy, literature, and the arts in order to nurture students' sense of refined culture. Using research processes from intellectual history, I place music in the constantly shifting discourse surrounding university arts curricula. I show how proponents for music in higher education borrowed not only rhetoric from the liberal culture reform movement, but from a number of competing reform movements in an effort to legitimize music as an academic subject. I use sociological theories of institutionalism to show how this discourse influenced the architects of prestigious music programs. Furthermore, I examine the importance of women and gender on the establishment of music in American universities. I argue that it was ultimately the collaboration between sympathetic administrators and composers-turned-professors that shaped the foundation of music in the modern American university. To this end, I use three case studies that chronicle the development of music programs at three influential American universities. The first of these is centered on Harvard professor John Knowles Paine, who worked closely with President Charles W. Eliot to build a program that emphasized the role of music in a cultural education within the new elective system. The second case study revolves around composer Horatio Parker. The Yale professor prioritized the study of music composition while establishing a School of Music that offered applied instruction and a number of general education opportunities. The final case study is a culminating moment in the acceptance of music as a university discipline. Composer and Columbia professor Edward MacDowell envisioned music as part of an interdisciplinary department of fine arts that would include literature, sculpture, painting, and architecture. After MacDowell's controversial resignation due to disagreements with President Nicholas Murray Butler, discourse about music in higher education was reinvigorated. This time, however, it figured in a larger debate concerning idealism and materialism in the university and reached beyond the confines of the humanities.",,,
1020,Preservice Secondary Mathematics Teachers' Development of Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching and Their Use of Knowledge in Their Instruction,"This study examined how preservice secondary mathematics teachers developed mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) around representations and big ideas through mathematics and mathematics education courses. The importance of big ideas and representations in mathematics has been emphasized in national standards as well as in literature. Yet, many studies suggested that teachers' conceptions or understandings of representations and big ideas are problematic. Nonetheless, there is a lack of attention from the mathematics education community regarding how and in what ways teachers develop knowledge in these areas. This is a longitudinal study focusing on three preservice secondary teachers who had taken mathematics and mathematics education courses for two years, one year as undergraduates and the other year as graduates in a teacher education program. The courses emphasized representations and big ideas and were designed to help preservice teachers develop MKT through problem solving and analysis of student thinking. As such, it was expected that preservice teachers would develop beliefs/conceptions and knowledge that were oriented around representations and big ideas. This study used qualitative methods to analyze classroom data, two individual interviews, and teacher assessment portfolios from student teaching. Three areas of knowledge were examined: ability in problem solving, knowledge of tasks, and knowledge of student thinking. The results showed that the participants improved knowledge and beliefs/conceptions with regard to representations and big ideas within the courses. However, they had difficulties transferring their knowledge to their practice. In the area of problem solving, they were able to successfully solve problems at the grade 5--8 level with which they were familiar through the courses, when they were prompted to use non-algebraic approaches. Yet, they had difficulties solving many high school level Cartesian representation-related problems even with prompts. They also showed tendencies to use algebraic approaches in problem solving for both grade 5--8 and high school level problems when they were not prompted. In the areas of knowledge of task and knowledge of student thinking, they were able to design tasks and analyze student thinking with an eye on representations and big ideas, when they were familiar with them through the courses. However, they had an eye mostly on procedural skills and students' errors rather than on big ideas and students difficulties with big ideas, when they had to design their own tasks and analyze their students' mathematical thinking during student teaching. Their lack of profound content knowledge in the topics they taught was one of the major contributing factors for those phenomena. It is advisable that secondary teacher educators pay extra attention to developing teachers' content knowledge as well as knowledge of student thinking. Without knowledge in these areas, it is unlikely that secondary teachers could help students understand critical mathematical ideas.",,,
1022,Designing pyramidal lattice structures for energy absorption,"Applications for energy absorption materials range from athletic equipment, to vehicle crumple zones, to blast protection for military vehicles and personnel. Many energy absorption structures employ stochastic foams because of their plateau-like stress-strain response that allows for the absorption of large amounts of energy at relatively low stresses over large compressive strains. Periodic lattice structures, when properly designed, provide the same capabilities as stochastic systems, but with a more tailorable response that provides potential for improved specific strength and energy absorption. The present dissertation provides an in-depth study of the pyramidal lattice: one particular periodic structure that strikes a good compromise between performance and manufacturability. Through finite element and analytical modeling, this study identifies key parameters of the geometry, boundary conditions, and parent material properties that determine the compressive stress-strain response of the structure. In conjunction with experimental investigations, these models are used to understand and determine the potential for improving the response of the as-manufactured polymeric pyramidal lattice structures through additional heat treatment and filling the lattice void-space with stochastic foam. Finally, additional models are developed to understand and predict the structural rate effects that arise from inertial stabilization of strut buckling during dynamic loading. Particular emphasis is given to the effects of yield strain and density of the parent material on failure modes and dynamic response. In addition to providing a strong basis for the design of pyramidal lattice materials, this work provides useful insight into the design of energy absorption materials in general.",,,
1023,"The Making of the Jamaican National Body: Colonialism and Public Health, 1918--1944","This dissertation, The Making of the Jamaican National Body: Colonialism and Public Health, 1918--1944 examines how the development of public health, aided by the intervention of the Rockefeller Foundation, intersected with the birth of nationalism in Jamaica between 1918 and 1944. It demonstrates that a modern public health program based in western biomedicine, racial categorization and colonial modes of behavior were vital to claims of fitness for self-rule by Jamaican nationalists. In the late 1930s the demand for greater representation in government was accompanied by the scrutiny of the sexual behaviors and personal hygiene of the Afro-Jamaican masses. I analyze how disease and reproduction played a central role in the competing constructions of Afro-Jamaican bodies by colonial elites and ambitious middle class nationalists. The failures of the colonial state to provide even the most basic health services to its subjects provided fodder for anti-colonial critiques and were bolstered by the significant contributions of the American philanthropic efforts of the Rockefeller Foundation. In contrast, white colonial elites viewed the presence of widespread disease in the majority Afro-Jamaican population as evidence of their backwardness and unpreparedness for self-governance. Both of these competing groups borrowed the legitimacy of science and medicine to substantiate their claims about the black masses that reinforced racial and class hierarchies with roots in the era of plantation slavery. My analysis of the connections between public health and nationalism in Jamaica is critical to understanding how race and health were intertwined in the final years of British control. I use Jamaica as an important case study that exemplifies how colonial and local patterns of racial hierarchy were deeply embedded in the public health interventions begun in 1918 by the Rockefeller Foundation and expanded in the 1930s to include campaigns against venereal disease and over-population by the Jamaican middle class. This dissertation connects the histories of colonial power, international philanthropy and nationalism through the bodies of Afro-Jamaicans.",,,
1024,"Smart Cookies: The Gendered Spaces of Labor, Citizenship, and Nationalism in the Girl Scout Cookie Sale","Each year thousands of Girl Scouts sell cookies to friends family, and neighbors to raise money for their troops and local councils. Lauded as the largest girl-led financial literacy program, the annual Girl Scout cookie sale not only teaches girls important business and leadership skills but also prepares girls for their roles as American women in a neoliberal and capitalist society. Girls learn the importance of 'giving' through multiple spaces of the cookie sale. Scouts learn to give and care for others under the veil of market capitalism, neoliberalism, and American nationalism, which seeks to reproduce hegemonic gender roles regarding labor, education, and citizenship. Based on a two-year study on the Girl Scout cookie sale, using qualitative methods and rooted in feminist methodologies, this project seeks to understand how 'spaces of giving' emerge in the cookie sale and how these spaces shape social constructions of gender, citizenship, and national identity.",,,
1025,Bulk and monolayer ordering of block copolymer blends,"The control of the nanoscale structure or morphology of a block copolymer is a desired goal for nanolithography applications. In this work, we are particularly interested in providing guides for controlling domain size, domain shape and defect densities in block copolymers and their blends for thin film applications. To reach this goal, a sphere forming PS-b-P2VP (having a PS majority block) and its blends with PS homopolymer or cylinder forming PS-b-P2VP are studied in both the bulk and thin films. Structure characterization is performed using a variety of experimental techniques including small angle X-ray scattering, scanning force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. In the bulk, the spherical domains of the pure, sphere forming PS-b-P2VP arrange on a BCC lattice. On adding PS homopolymer (hPS), the lattice parameter of the BCC spheres increases, while the order-to-disorder temperature (ODT) of the BCC lattice simultaneously decreases. At a given hPS composition, the use of larger sized hPS leads to larger increases in the lattice parameter and larger decreases in the ODT. In bulk blends of cylinder forming PS-b-P2VP with sphere forming PS-b-P2VP, the ordered morphology changes (e.g., cylindrical morphology  coexisting spherical and cylindrical morphologies  spherical morphology) as the sphere forming PS-b-P2VP volume fraction phis increases, while the ODT of the cylindrical morphology decreases. The phase boundaries of these morphologies in monolayers shift to lower phis compared to those of the bulk, apparently caused by a selective adsorption of the cylindrical PS-b-P2VP to form a brush on the substrate. This selective adsorption leads to a preference for spherical domains in diamond-shaped lateral confinements when cylindrical domains are stabilized outside the confinements on the same substrate. Finally, we explore the use of graphoepitaxy to order monolayers of sphere forming PS-b-P2VP and its blends with hPS. The probability of forming isolated dislocations, or of adding (or removing) a full row of spherical domains, in diamond-shaped lateral confinements is shown to be higher when the well size is incommensurate with the lattice parameter. Square-shaped lateral confinement leads to a preference for square sphere packing if the PS-b-P2VP is blended with appropriate amounts of hPS.",,,
1026,Eating disorders and body image on college campuses: Counselors' experiences with diverse student populations,"It is estimated 25 million Americans suffer from one or more eating illnesses (Alliance for Eating Disorder Awareness, 2013) with 43% experiencing the onset of such disorders between 16 and 20.6 years of age (National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, 2013). This places a considerable number of young adults at risk for these health issues during their college studies. Traditionally, eating disorder and body image research has largely focused on Caucasian females of middle to high socioeconomic status. Eating and body issues, however, affect students from a diversity of sociocultural backgrounds, with students often experiencing a very dissimilar set of social pressures. The latter is critical to recognize, for if counseling approaches that have successfully treated white, middle class, females become extended to working with all students who have eating disorders or body image issues, these generalizations may cause some populations of college students - such as males, athletes, and students of color - to have their health needs inadequately addressed. This study interviewed 22 counselors at colleges and universities around the United States about their experiences working with students on eating disorders and body image issues, particularly male students, student athletes, and racial/ethnic minority students. Grounded theory was used as an inductive methodology for collecting data, and then incorporating that data into open, axial, and selective coding processes. Findings from this study highlight the importance of culturally-sensitive approaches when working on eating disorders and body image illnesses with diverse student populations. This study aims to broaden awareness of specific eating and body stressors posed to male students, student athletes, and racial/ethnic minority students, and to invoke discussions about how college and university campuses may effectively incorporate students' sociocultural identities into mental health treatments.",,,
1027,"Semantics, Pragmatics, and the Nature of Semantic Theories","The primary concern of this dissertation is determining the distinction between semantics and pragmatics and how context sensitivity should be accommodated within a semantic theory. I approach the question over how to distinguish semantics from pragmatics from a new angle by investigating what the objects of a semantic theory are, namely expressions or utterances. In Chapter 1, I investigate the preceding question. I am approaching the question of how to draw the line between semantics and pragmatics by first considering what the objects of a semantic theory are. This is an under-appreciated point in this discussion. By beginning with this question I am approaching this from a new and important angle. For if we are interested in what literal meanings are assigned to, it is a necessary step to consider what the objects of a semantic theory are. This dissertation proceeds in answering this question over what the objects of a semantic theory are by arguing that they are expression types relativized to contexts, or expressions-in-context, by relying on arguments presented by David Kaplan. In addition it is argued that the way we approach language is expression based in that we often assign semantic content to sentences that are not a part of any obvious utterances. Moreover, it is then argued that semantics based on expressions-in-context provide a clear account of examples of the historical present without positing additional ambiguity. In Chapter 2, I approach a powerful objection to an expression based approach to semantics, that of true demonstratives, i.e. expressions the use of which require an actual demonstration. If semantics proceeds by assigning content to expressions-in-context, how can it assign different contents to 'that' occurring more than once in the same sentence while maintaining that it has the same linguistic meaning? Stefano Predelli defends the view that by representing the linguistic meaning, i.e. character, of 'that' as a function from the context and an integer, representing the location of 'that' in the sentence, to the demonstratum in that context, we can maintain a single meaning for all demonstrative occurrences of 'that'. I develop this idea further and compare it with Nathan Salmon's approach to demonstratives whereby the relevant demonstration is in the formal context rather than the demonstratum. I conclude by arguing that by taking expressions-in-context as the objects of a semantic theory, rather than utterances, we can still formally account for true demonstratives, and as a result show that the approach developed in the first chapter can handle this objection. In Chapter 3, I approach the question of how we might determine if apparent contextual influence on communication is semantically required or pragmatically influencing the communicated content. If we approach semantics as expressions rather than utterances, we must find a method for determining whether contextual features are triggered by the linguistic meaning of expressions. In the hopes of getting clearer on when context is semantically relevant I consider numerous tests that have been presented in the literature, but find them all wanting. These have been put forward by Cappelen and Lepore, Cappelen and Hawthorne, and Jason Stanley. I evaluate each in turn and conclude that although someone may be able to develop tests to provide some evidence for when an expression is context sensitive, no test is immediately forthcoming. As a result of this conclusion, the best that we can do is evaluate complete theories based on coherency and explanatory power. In Chapter 4, my final chapter, I apply the results set out in earlier chapters to a particularly problematic case study: negative existentials. Negative existentials present a pressing case because any purely semantic approach will find a problem with them. So, any solution to this problem will rest on the distinction between semantics and pragmatics. I develop a theory of negative existentials based on Gricean generalized conversational implicatures within the framework provided by the distinction made in Chapter 1, where semantics assigns contents to expressions while pragmatics to utterances as well as the results of Chapter 3, namely that if we cannot test an expression for context sensitivity we must evaluate a more overarching theory for coherency. I argue that building on the discussion of an expression-based approach to semantics we have a better formula for explaining intuitions regarding negative existentials. To do this, I argue that names originating in fiction refer to genuinely existing abstract artifacts allowing negative existentials to have truth-values. This results in an elegant semantics and the intuition that the negative existential is true is handled by the Gricean theory of conversational implicatures. (Abstract shortened by UMI.).",,,
1029,"Primary carbonate mineralogy of Lower Algal Chert Member ooids and stromatolites, Paleoproterozoic Gunflint Formation, Ontario, Canada","The chert members of the Paleoproterozoic Gunflint Formation, Ontario, Canada, are commonly regarded as examples of primary silica chemical sediments. This interpretation is founded upon the high fidelity of preservation of microfossils in the chert, the ubiquitous nature of silica, and a lack of observed primary carbonate. Previous arguments for silica replacement of limestone (carbonate) are based on indirect evidence and are largely dismissed. Gunflint microfossils are thus regarded as having lived in a silica-rich environment, which makes them unusual compared to most other pre-Phanerozoic microfossils that are known from silicified carbonates. Direct evidence that carbonate was a primary mineral species of the Lower Algal Chert Member (where most of the microbiota are found) has been discovered at Whitefish Falls, Nolalu, Ontario. Iron-stained, low-Mg calcite ooids containing (1) well-preserved growth laminae, (2) textures indicating a disrupted tangential fabric of growth laminae, and (3) quartz cross-cutting the growth laminae indicate the initial mineral of the ooids was a carbonate, probably aragonite. Stromatolite columns contain large areas of low-Mg calcite, with specular hematite crystals that display cross-cutting relationships with calcite and quartz that demonstrate calcite was primary, hematite secondary, and quartz tertiary. The cross-cutting relations also show that silicification took place in at least two stages. One of the silicification events took place very early in diagenesis. Thus the Gunflint microbiota may not have existed in a radically different environment (silica precipitating) than those of most other known Proterozoic microbiotas. High fidelity of preservation of microfossils does not always indicate that the mineral entombing them was the primary mineral precipitated from aqueous solution.",,,

1031,Irrational Beliefs: Theory and Economic Applications,"The three chapters of this dissertation are each separate research papers in behavioral economics, though the second and third respectively provide applications to macroeconomics and finance. The first chapter studies what I call the weighted updating model, which is a generalization of Bayesian updating that allows for biased beliefs by weighting the functions that constitute Bayes' rule with real exponents. I provide an axiomatic development of the model. On the way, I show that weighting a distribution results in a systematic change in information entropy, suggesting that weighted updating can model biases in which individuals mistake the information content of the observations from which they make inferences. I augment the base model in two ways, allowing it to account for additional biases. The first expansion involves discrimination between data. The second allows the weights to vary over time. This chapter also presents a set of sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of parameter estimation through maximum likelihood, with log-concavity playing a key role. An application shows that self attribution bias can lead to optimism bias. The second chapter builds upon some of the findings in the first chapter. Specifically, I examine the implications of self-attribution bias on consumption and savings decisions. When self-attributive learning replaces rational expectations in a model of intertemporal choice, two departures from the permanent-income hypotheses manifest. One is that consumers tend to under-save early in life. Another is a relatively high degree of covariance between changes in consumption and changes in income. No other factor on its own has been able to explain both of these empirical anomalies that the permanent-income hypothesis has faced. Chapter three presents the results of an experiment designed to investigate whether order effects are due to the imperfections of memory and whether order effects influence valuations. After experimental participants observed a sequence of six random returns from an asset on a computer screen, I elicited the participants' valuations for a random return from the asset. The subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group observed returns that remained on display once they were revealed, while the control group saw each return for only three seconds at a time. The analysis suggests that these groups utilized the observed returns differently in forming their valuations and that order effects do influence valuations. The results also provide evidence that the experimental group exhibited order effects, suggesting that memory is not the only cause of order effects.",,,
1032,Field-Based Simulations of Nanostructured Polyelectrolyte Gels,"Recently, experimentalists have developed nanostructured, responsive hydrogels that make use of electrostatic interactions in order to form physical cross-links. Due to the ability of these hydrogels to respond to a variety of stimuli including pH, temperature and ion concentration, they are particularly suited for a wide range of biomedical applications including drug delivery and tissue scaffolding. Before use in practical applications, one must first learn how to tune the hydrogels for specific applications. To this end, we study these novel materials using both analytic techniques and computer simulations. The well established technique of self-consistent field theory (SCFT), which makes use of the saddle point approximation, completely fails to capture the electrostatic correlations necessary to accurately simulate the hydrogels. An alternative to SCFT is to use field-theoretic simulations with complex Langevin (CL) sampling, which simulate the unapproximated model. However, as a newer technique, CL simulations present numerous challenges including the lack of methods for simulating stress-free configurations. Although there has been a concerted effort to make CL simulations more amenable, at their current state of development, we found these challenges prohibitive. Thus, we have taken a different approach. Inspired by an analytic approximation to the model, we develop an entirely new model that implicitly incorporates the essential electrostatic correlations such that the SCFT technique can be used. Using our new model, we generate phase diagrams for the hydrogel system. We find that the phase diagram includes various microphases as well as regions of phase coexistence. Using full CL simulations we then validate our model by reproducing selected points on the phase diagram. Finally, we directly compare our predictions to recent experimental results and discuss how parameters such as charge density and solvent quality can be used to tune the hydrogel systems. In addition to our simulations of hydrogels, we also performed a systematic investigation of the performance of algorithms to solve the modified diffusion equation, the most computationally expensive step for both SCFT and CL, and found that the most computationally efficient algorithm is highly dependent on the simulation technique used. We also studied anisotropic diblock copolymer colloidal particles and developed a model the reproduces the experimentally observed trend of increasing aspect ratio with increasing particle size. The agreement of our calculations with experiment suggest that thermodynamic, rather than kinetic, effects drive the particle anisotropy.",,,
1033,Regeneration Anxiety: Queer Theory and Speculative Fiction,"Regeneration Anxiety explores the intersection between cultural representations of the apocalypse and anxieties over non-normative, ""unproductive"" sexualities. Underlying our cultural fixation with dystopianism, I argue, is an anxiety over the ability to regenerate and remake the world. My work brings together current debates in queer theory and risk and speculation studies, fields that interrogate perceptions of futurity. I show how apocalyptic futurism plays out sexual and regenerative anxieties: our fears of not being able to extend our offspring, ourselves, and our world into perpetuity. My work locates regeneration anxiety in twentieth and twenty-first century speculative works---fictions engaged with imagining possible worlds---and it explores a range of texts to show how conservative discourses have framed queerness not only as a threat to the future world, but also to the supposedly natural and divinely ordained higher order that structures it. Both queerness and apocalyptic narratives expose myths of circularity and generational repetition to the finite inasmuch as they portend regenerative failure. I show how queerness is not only a set of practices, but a viewpoint that troubles visions of the transcendental and provides a confrontation with the immanent, in which there is no longer a correspondence between our world and an external, Other order. I locate a liberating potentiality in queerness, however, demonstrating how it provides a view outside of the reifying structures of transcendental belief.",,,
1034,"Settler Colonialism after Empire: Race and the Politics of British Migration to Southern Africa, 1939--1980","This dissertation traces the evolution of immigration policy and practice in South Africa and Rhodesia/Zimbabwe from the Second World War to the 1970s. It outlines the importance of wartime experience in explaining the surge in post-war migration to southern Africa. It then traces the role of migration in the attempt to reinvent empire as Commonwealth in the decades after the Second World War as the British government encouraged migration to the Dominions and Southern Rhodesia despite a labor shortage. Using debates surrounding immigration, it highlights the tensions in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia as minority settler colonial regimes between gaining more white population and ensuring racial prestige in the 1940s and 1950s.Though always determined by race, by the 1960s, selective policies based on nationality and class gave way to more aggressive recruitment of immigrants defined by these states as white as a demographic defense of minority rule in a rapidly decolonizing continent. Though such efforts bore limited results in war torn Rhodesia, South Africa saw a dramatic increase of European and particularly British migration from the 1960s to the early 1980s. Alongside this political and demographic study, it uses migrant oral histories, biographies and letters to reveal the ongoing personal and familial ties between these nations and Britain, and the persistence of imperial migration networks even after the collapse of formal empire. Challenging the characterization of South African republic in 1961 and the Rhodesian Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 as sharp breaks with the United Kingdom, this dissertation adds to a growing literature complicating the chronology of decolonization.",,,
1036,"From apathy to empowerment: Generations, media and attitudes towards politics in Chile","The radical changes in the political system that Chile has experienced in the last fifty years have affected the way different generations of citizens relate to the political world. I examine the emergence of a new generation of citizens, completely socialized during democracy, who are using unconventional participation channels to affect the public agenda. Using survey data collected in Chile from 1990 to 2011 I unearth the differences in political attitudes and behaviors of three generations of Chileans. I find that the characterization of Chilean youth as pervasively apathetic does not hold if analyzed under a more expansive view of citizenship. I also find that the use of social media as a political information outlet positively affects youth support for extra institutional participation channels.",,,

Furthermore, presenting the Hui in terms of ethnic designation without a critical consideration of how that designation evolved can lead to broad misunderstandings in this topic. This thesis describes how the meaning of 'Hui' has shifted over time from designating geographic origin, to religion, to nation, and finally ethnicity and highlights important social and political causes and effects of those changes. I encourage scholars to carefully note these changes in order to be more precise about how the term 'Hui' should be interpreted in various historical contexts.",,,
1038,Assessing Circuit-Level Properties of VeSFET-based ICs,"Modern semiconductor industry faces skyrocketing design and manufacturing cost as technology advances. Vertical Slit Field Effect Transistor (VeSFET) based ICs have super regular layouts which may significantly reduce manufacturing cost. VeSFETs can be packed densely in an array fashion thus VeSFET-based ICs may achieve smaller footprints than their CMOS counterparts. VeSFET-based ICs also have great energy efficiency, and are good candidate for 3-D integration. In this dissertation, we study VeSFET ICs mapped to various array topologies (canvases), and characterize their area, performance, power, and thermal behaviors. VeSFET-based circuits are implemented by customizing interconnects on pre-manufactured canvases. In this dissertation, we particularly focus on a class of canvases referred to as chain canvases (CCs). CMOS-oriented design automation tools can be easily adapted for CC-based VeSFET designs. VeSFET ICs based on CCs demonstrate very good performance and low power. Detailed routing for super dense VeSFET layouts can be very challenging because highly congested pins are hard to access. We propose a two-sided routing strategy for VeSFET chips. We show that such routing not only provides much better routability, but also achieves better performance and lower power than one-sided routing. Thermal management constitutes a huge challenge for CMOS or FinFET-based circuits, especially when chips go 3-D. VeSFET provides an alternative thermal-friendly design choice. In this dissertation, we show that temperature increase due to self-heating is very small for VeSFET transistors. At chip level, VeSFET-based 2-D and 3-D chips not only have much lower power density, but also better vertical thermal conductivity than their CMOS counterparts. Finally, we explore VeSFET-based subthreshold circuits for ultra-low power applications.",,,
1039,Flooding and carbon dynamics on the lower Amazon floodplain,"The Amazon basin stores and cycles large quantities of water and carbon, and floodplains are an important part of these processes. In this dissertation, I studied the interactions of hydrological and biogeochemical processes over a large floodplain unit in the eastern Amazon, the Curuai floodplain. I combined digital topography derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission with extensive echo-sounding data to generate a hydraulically correct digital elevation model. Floodplain inundation was simulated over a period of 15 years (1995-2010) using LISFLOOD-FP, which combines one-dimensional river routing with two-dimensional overland flow, and a local hydrological model. An accurate filling and drainage of the floodplain was achieved with quantification of changes in water elevation, flooding extent, and river-floodplain flows. Levee height and channel topography were the main controls of river-floodplain exchanges during high and low-water, respectively. The inflow from the Amazon River corresponded to 82% of annual inputs from all sources, with dominant sources of inflow varying seasonally among direct rain and local runoff (November), Amazon River (December through August) and groundwater seepage (September and October). A water balance analysis and concentrations and transformations of carbon from other studies on the central Amazon floodplain were used to compute the fluxes through the major pathways of carbon loss from the Curuai floodplain. Carbon dioxide outgassing represented 86% of the total carbon loss and its seasonal and spatial variability was further investigated. The seasonal changes in lake mixing patterns exerted an important control over both carbon dioxide production and gas transfer velocities. The range of spatial variation in carbon dioxide concentration was least at low water and largest at high water. Gas transfer coefficients that take into account both wind and heat fluxes at the lake's surface were approximately four times higher than values previously used in regional estimates of gas evasion from lakes on the Amazon floodplain.",,,
1040,Integrated Linewidth Reduction of Rapidly Tunable Semiconductor Lasers,"Widely tunable lasers with fast tuning speeds have applications in dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM), optical sensing and optical packet switching. In DWDM, tunable lasers can greatly reduce inventory costs, increase manufacturing efficiency, and increase flexibility. For this application, tunable lasers must meet stringent requirements in terms of linewidth, SMSR, RIN, etc. As coherent detection moves to higher modulation formats to increase spectral efficiency, linewidths on the order of 100 kHz will be required. In FMCW LIDAR, the sensing range is directly coupled to the coherence length, i.e. linewidth, of the laser, and the resolution is determined by the tuning range of the laser. A laser with a 40 nm tuning range and 100 kHz linewidth can lead to a LIDAR system with 30 microm of resolution at a 1.5 km range. The above motivations demonstrate the need for a laser that is widely tunable, with tuning speeds in the nanosecond regime, a 100 kHz linewidth and small form factor. Many different approaches have been taken to achieve a low linewidth laser, generally with the trade-off of slower tuning speeds or larger size. Typically, the widely tunable mirrors used to create a highly agile laser are noisy. In our approach we use negative feedback along with an InGaAsP/InP photonic integrated circuit (PIC) to reduce the linewidth of a widely tunable SG-DBR laser. The SG-DBR laser has a 40 nm tuning range, ns tuning speeds and is 1.5 mm long. Typically the linewidth is in the MHz range due to carrier induced frequency fluctuations. We use an asymmetric Mach Zehnder integrated on the same PIC to monitor and convert the laser frequency fluctuations to amplitude fluctuations. This error signal is fed back through a stabilizing loop filter to the phase tuning section of the SG-DBR laser to reduce the laser linewidth. Through integration of all the optical components, the loop delay is minimized and loop bandwidths upwards of 600 MHz have been achieved. Using this technique, we demonstrate an SG-DBR laser with the linewidth suppressed from 19 MHz to 150 kHz, which is the lowest linewidth yet for an SG-DBR laser.",,,
1041,Graduate and Undergraduate Students' Teaching Practices in a Place-Based Outreach Program,"This study explores how university students (i.e., undergraduate and graduate students) participating in a place-based outreach program practiced teaching strategies on four field trips. The outreach program, Learning in Place-Based Environments (LPBE), provided opportunities for the university students to teach fifth grade students about place, including through focusing on the natural attributes of a place, promoting sustainable living in a place, and integrating the diverse meanings that a place holds (see Semken, 2005). This research is informed by the literature on science teacher effectiveness, science outreach programs that provide teaching opportunities, learning to teach through apprenticeship, and place-based education. The intended and enacted curricula of the LPBE program were studied. The field trip station lesson plans were reviewed for evidence of place-based teaching strategies. Videotapes of the university students teaching fifth grade students in different outdoor locations were analyzed according to the types of teaching strategies that they practiced. In addition, the frequency and co-occurrence of various teaching strategies were examined. Overall, the university students practiced relatively few place-based teaching strategies. Also, challenges that the university students faced while teaching fifth grade students on the field trips are outlined. This study has implications for developing training opportunities for educators to learn about how to incorporate place into their educational programs. Keywords: place-based education, science outreach programs, undergraduate and graduate students.",,,
1043,Palestinian Refugees in Lebanon: Access to the Lebanese Legal System,"This study seeks to assess the ability of Palestinian refugees to access the Lebanese court system and analyzes how the launch of a legal aid program by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), in coordination with the Lebanese non-profit Public Interest and Advocacy Centre Lebanon, has impacted the ability of this refugee community to access the legal system of their host country. Drawing upon field research, discussions with scholars and formal and informal interviews conducted with Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, the findings suggest that many Palestinian refugees cannot afford the cost of legal representation, and the refugees hesitate to use the court system as they strongly associate the Lebanese state and its institutions with corruption and targeted discrimination. Furthermore, the inability of Palestinian lawyers to present cases in Lebanese courts means that Palestinian refugees living in camps must navigate the often unfamiliar terrain of Lebanese cities to secure a Lebanese lawyer. As a result, the refugee community has largely turned to informal mechanisms for settling disputes within the refugee camps- relying on the weak self-governance structures. With the introduction of the UNRWA-PINACLE Legal Aid Program in 2010, Palestinian refugees in Lebanon were provided with free legal representation and legal counseling. While the program has mitigated several obstructions which Palestinian refugees encounter in attempting to present grievances in Lebanese courts, blockages to full access of the Lebanese legal system remain in place. Ultimately, this work offers a multi-layered platform for understanding the status of the Palestinian refugee's ability to access Lebanese courts in context of the emerging civil rights campaign headed by governmental and non-governmental organizations in Lebanon- concluding that the organizations' efforts cannot replace the substantive changes which must occur on the Lebanese state-level.",,,
1044,Passive dynamics and maneuverability in flapping-wing robots,"Research on flapping-wing micro-aerial vehicles (MAV) has grown steadily in the past decade, aiming to address unique challenges in morphological construction, power requirements, force production, and control strategy. In particular, vehicles inspired by hummingbird or insect flight have been remarkably successful in generation of adequate lift force for levitation and vertical acceleration; however, finding effective methods for motion control still remains an open problem. Here, to address this problem we introduce and analyze a bio-inspired approach that guarantees stable and agile flight maneuvers. Analysis of flight muscles in insects/hummingbirds suggests that mechanical impedance of the wing joint could be the key to flight control mechanisms employed by these creatures. Through developing a quasi-steady-state aerodynamic model for insect flight, we were able to show that presence of a similar structure - e.g. a torsional spring - at the base of each wing can result in its passive rotation during a stroke cycle. It has been observed that manipulating the stiffness of this structure affects lift production via limiting the extent of wing rotation. Furthermore, changing the equilibrium point of the passive element introduces asymmetries in the drag profile which can generate considerable amounts of mean thrust while avoiding significant disturbances on lift production. Flight simulations using a control strategy based on these observations - a.k.a. the Mechanical Impedance Manipulation (MIM) technique - demonstrate a high degree of maneuverability and agile flight capabilities. Correlation analysis suggests that by limiting the changes in mechanical impedance properties to frequencies well below that of stroke, the coupling between lift and thrust production is reduced even further, enabling us to design and employ simple controllers without degrading flight performance. Unlike conventional control approaches that often rely on manipulation of stroke profile, our bio-inspired method is able to operate with constant stroke magnitudes and flapping frequencies. This feature combined with low bandwidth requirements for mechanical impedance manipulation result in very low power requirements, a feature that is of great importance in development of practical flapping-wing MAVs.",,,
1045,The Relationship Between Ethnic Identity and Residence Hall Preference,"This study explored the relationship between students' residence hall preference and ethnic identity. The study explored differences in ethnic identity development among first-year Chicano/Latino college students who actively requested to live on a culturally themed living learning community and were placed there; Chicano/Latino students who actively requested the culturally themed community and were not placed there; and those who actively requested to live in a non-culturally themed community. The sample of 116 students all resided in University owned housing of similar size, resources, and staff. Overall, results reflected students that requested and lived on the cultural floor differed only from the students that requested a traditional residence hall on scores of exploration and resolution , but not for affirmation. Students who requested the cultural floor but did not live there did not significantly differ from either group on any three of the subscales (exploration, resolution, and affirmation).",,,
1046,Transport of nanoparticles and reacting biomolecules in micro- and nanofluidic electrokinetic systems,"Micro and nanofluidic systems are ideal platforms for breakthrough bioanalytical tools. In particular, transport in nanoscale channels has been shown to be different than microscale systems because of unique coupled physics associated with wall interactions, electrokinetic surface phenomena and hydrodynamic confinement. Furthermore, understanding the effects of reaction kinetics during capillary electrophoresis is necessary for reliable bioanalytical tools with reacting species. We present experimental data and numerical simulation to elucidate the dominant physics at these lengths scales toward enabling nanofluidic bioanalytical devices. First, we present an experimental study to measure the effect channel height and ionic strength on the electrophoretic mobility of spherical nanoparticles and short single strand (ss) and double strand (ds) DNA with channel depths ranging from 20 microns to 100 nm. We find increased hydrodynamic drag in confinement, nanoparticle rotation effects for spherical analytes in sheer flows, non-uniform electro-osmotic velocity profiles, and electrostatic repulsion of thick electric double layers to be important effects on transport. Second, we present an experimental study of electrokinetic separations of short, complementary ss and dsDNA in microchannels. We find different phenomena are significant for the three different DNA lengths in the study (10nt, 20nt, and 50nt). Reaction kinetic effects are significant for the shortest length DNA, where the melting temperature is comparable to room temperature. For longer 20 and 50nt DNA, the melting temperatures are sufficiently high and reaction kinetic effects are constant. In addition, the 50 nt ssDNA contour length is greater than the persistence length and we find changes in electrophoretic mobility with ionic strength resulting from changes in conformation. Finally, we present numerical simulations of the previous study on separations of reacting DNA. Reaction kinetics can affect the equilibrium ratio of ss to dsDNA which influences transport by shifting the observed electrophoretic mobility of the dsDNA peak away from the true electrophoretic mobility. We perform parametric simulations of relevant parameters and find the initial plug width, analyte concentration and kinetic rate constants are the important parameters on the observed dsDNA peak. In addition, we use our model to determine reaction kinetic parameters (ie KD) of experimental data.",,,
1047,Essays in Applied Microeconomics and Econometrics,"This dissertation consists of three distinct papers. The first chapter estimates the effect of local labor market opportunities on crime among individuals exiting prison in California. The second chapter studies the behavior of the cluster robust variance estimator, commonly used in empirical research, when standard assumptions regarding the structure of observations across groups are relaxed. Finally, the third chapter estimates a compensating differential for fatality risk for workers in Mexico. An abstract for each chapter is provided below. Chapter 1 Abstract: Identifying a causal effect of labor market opportunities on criminal behavior is difficult given (a) an endogenous relationship between labor markets and crime and (b) the challenge of using aggregate measures to capture employment opportunities for individuals on the margin of criminal activity. The institutional structure of the California criminal justice system as well as location-, skill-, and industry-specific employment measures provide a unique framework to identify a causal effect. I find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the prevalence of relevant employment opportunities is associated with a 1 to 2 percent decrease in the probability released offenders return to prison. Chapter 2 Abstract: We study the behavior of a cluster-robust t statistic and make two principle contributions. First, we relax the restriction of previous asymptotic theory that clusters have identical size, and establish that the cluster-robust t statistic continues to have a Gaussian asymptotic null distribution. Second, we determine how variation in cluster sizes, together with other sources of cluster heterogeneity, affect the behavior of the test statistic. To do so, we determine the sample specific measure of cluster heterogeneity that governs this behavior and show that the measure depends on how three quantities vary over clusters: cluster size, the cluster specific error covariance matrix and the actual value of the covariates. Because, in the absence of a fixed design, the third quantity will always vary over clusters, the vast majority of empirical analyses have test statistics whose finite sample behavior is impacted by cluster heterogeneity. To capture this impact, we develop the effective number of clusters, which scales down the actual number of clusters by the measure of cluster heterogeneity. Through simulation we demonstrate this effect and find rejection rates as high as 30 percent for a nominal size of 5 percent. We then apply our measure of cluster heterogeneity in several empirical settings to show how observable variation over clusters impacts the performance of a cluster-robust test. Chapter 3 Abstract: The escalation in violence in recent years resulting from the Mexican government's war on drug trafficking has caused a large and unprecedented increase in workplace fatality risk for workers in Mexico. We exploit this increase to estimate a compensating differential for fatality risk using panel data constructed from a national employment and occupation survey. We also provide estimates of the value of a statistical life (VSL) in Mexico. Our results imply a VSL between $160,000 and $350,000 U.S dollars for a nationally representative sample of Mexican workers. This is well below the range of estimates typically found in developed countries, which is consistent with the notion that health and safety are normal goods.",,,
1048,Making Visible the Complexities of Problem Solving: An Ethnographic Study of a General Chemistry Course in a Studio Learning Environment,"Studio classrooms, designed such that laboratory and lecture functions can occur in the same physical space, have been recognized as a promising contributing factor in promoting collaborative learning in the sciences (NRC, 2011). Moreover, in designing for instruction, a critical goal, especially in the sciences and engineering, is to foster an environment where students have opportunities for learning problem solving practices (NRC, 2012a). However, few studies show how this type of innovative learning environment shapes opportunities for learning in the sciences, which is critical to informing future curricular and instructional designs for these environments. Even fewer studies show how studio environments shape opportunities to develop problem solving practices specifically. In order to make visible how the learning environment promotes problem solving practices, this study explores problem solving phenomena in the daily life of an undergraduate General Chemistry studio class using an ethnographic perspective. By exploring problem solving as a sociocultural process, this study shows how the instructor and students co-construct opportunities for learning in whole class and small group interactional spaces afforded in this studio environment and how the differential demands on students in doing problems requires re-conceptualizing what it means to ""apply a concept"".",,,
1049,Theory of Mind Processing in a Callosotomy Patient,"The ability to predict and explain the behavior of others based on their mental states, known as theory of mind, has long been studied from a developmental perspective. More recently, the cognitive neurosciences along with patient studies have revealed key brain regions involved in this process, including the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and more specifically, the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ). In split-brain patients, several interesting findings have emerged in regards to theory of mind processing. Research has uncovered that some patients demonstrate specific difficulties on tasks requiring moral reasoning and the detection of faux pas. In this study, we attempted to investigate theory of mind processing in a split-brain patient, seeking to help explain reasons behind these difficulties. We also attempted to utilize techniques designed to assess each hemisphere of the brain independently, to better understand the specialized role of the rTPJ in belief attribution. One split-brain patient, V.P., was tested on a battery of established theory of mind tasks as well as various cognitive assessment tasks. On cognitive tasks assessing processing speed and inhibitory processing, V.P. showed slower reaction times compare to controls, which may reflect specific deficits or may be explained by the careful, considerate approach V.P. took in completing the various tasks. On theory of mind tasks, V.P. did show slight deficits on belief-desire reasoning and attributing mental states compared to controls. Results from the lateralized theory of mind tasks showed that V.P.'s left and right hemispheres had difficulties completing the tasks, suggesting both hemispheres may be required for such demanding processing tasks. A clear explanation of the exact reasons for V.P.'s performance across these tasks and how they relate to one another will require further investigation and analysis.",,,
1050,Three Essays in Development Economics,"This dissertation consists of three essays in development economics in three different national contexts. The first essay explores the productivity differential between return migrants (""Sea Turtles"") and non-migrants through a case study of China's venture capital (VC) industry. I find that even after correcting for selection bias, return venture capitalists are less productive than comparable non-migrants in targeting promising projects and/or providing value-added services. Given that the VC industry is a useful laboratory in which to look at the performance of return migrants and China's economic development, I discuss why the presumably better human capital accumulated overseas does not translate into productivity in the Chinese market, and how related policies could reverse this situation in the long run. The second essay exploits panel data and large, abrupt, and unusual dislocations of Indonesian workers in the wake of the Asian Financial Crisis to investigate the robustness and persistence of inter-industry wage differentials (IWDs). Unobserved worker characteristics explain 36% of IWDs. IWDs persist through the post-crisis decade, although, consistent with a rent-sharing explanation, they shift alongside sectors' terms of trade in the wake of the crisis. Agriculture pays a wage penalty, and manufacturing sector a statistically significant but small premium. Most IWDs do not seem to be driven by minimum wage laws, worker monitoring costs, the disagreeability of the work, job-specific skills, industry-specific human capital, non-wage benefits or contracting terms. In the third essay, the author examines the reduced-form relationship between the venture capital (VC) penetration and the embodied technological change (through the growth of capital services) and the disembodied technological change (through the growth of the total factor productivity (TFP)) at the sectoral level in the US. Combining various datasets from EU-KLEMS, PwC MoneyTree Report and STAN and applying various econometric strategies suitable for dynamic panel data, the author finds that the VC accessibility is positively associated with the capital service/TFP growth contemporarily, but that it is negatively correlated with them in the following years.",,,
1051,Three Essays on Time Varying Spatial Price Behavior and Correlation Structures,"This dissertation consists of three separate papers. In the first paper I ask how the influence of global and local forces on Mexican maize prices changed during a period when markets became more open to inter and intra-national trade. I find that the influence of global forces do vary over the study period, and counter to expectation, are highest at the beginning and middle of the period rather than the end. In contrast, the influence of local forces follows expectation and decreases over time. However the effect sizes diminish in a model that accounts for unobserved state-year variation, which could include policy interventions designed specifically to cushion against local influences. Overall, the results suggest that opening agricultural markets can result in regionally distinct outcomes and that government price supports have a stronger impact on the influence of local forces than they do on global forces. In the second paper I evaluate characteristic based clustering (CBC) as a tool to both facilitate forecasts of cross-market grain price data and conduct exploratory analysis of price behavior dissimilarities across multiple markets. Characteristic based clustering refers to the practice of identifying similarities in multiple time series where the distances among the time series are a function of the structural characteristics in the data. I conduct a simulation experiment to determine if the characteristic clustering approach can be used to improve the accuracy or computational efficiency of grain price forecasts. I find that forecasts from characteristic based clusters of time series are sometimes as accurate as forecasts from individual time series and can be completed in 60-80% of the computational time. In the second half of the paper I use characteristic based clustering to explore the similarity of price behavior among Kenyan maize markets. I find that price behavior in remote markets has become increasingly dissimilar from markets in other Kenyan cities, and that these dissimilarities cannot be explained solely by geographic distance. The final paper focuses on the appropriate method of inference when modeling balanced spatial panel data with unobserved time varying spatial correlation. I use simulation experiments to compare the performance of estimation techniques that use prespecified spatial weights matrices and those that do not. The results suggest that the pattern of time varying correlation does have some impact on the choice of method, but not as much as the spatial weights misspecification literature would suggest. I also find that choosing the appropriate inferential method is less of a concern if the data generating process follows a hub and spoke correlation structure. Finally, I confirm earlier results that the cluster robust modifications proposed by Bester, Conley, and Hansen (2011) perform well as long as group sizes are chosen appropriately.",,,
1052,The Confidant Response Model: Examining the Impact of Structure on Response Decisions for Recipients of Distressing Disclosures,"Modern technology has created a confessional culture, in which individuals regularly disclose personal information on public forums. However, little research has examined the effects of these disclosures on confidants. As such, the Confidant Response Theory (CRT) is advanced. The CRT is a framework that advances three phases (structural elements, cost-benefit analysis of engaging, and boundary management) to explain the impact of structural features and outcome expectancies on confidant decision-making processes. A portion of the CRT is tested, against the backdrop of research on the bystander effect, by manipulating structural features identifying response publicness on a simulated social networking site. Specifically, participants were led to believe they were viewing an acquaintance's distressing post on Facebook, and were given the option to either publicly comment or skip the posting. Response decisions and latencies were recorded. Findings indicate that structure indeed impacts response decisions: individuals were less likely to help (e.g., leave a textual response) in the presence of greater numbers of bystanders, and those who left a textual comment took longer to help when those bystanders included more friends. Finally, the present investigation examined the impact of online helping behaviors on immediately following offline helping behaviors, finding that those individuals who helped online were more likely to help offline. Practical and theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.",,,
1053,Misery Loves Company: Melancholy Aesthetics and Nineteenth-Century British Fiction,"This dissertation argues that the narrative fiction of nineteenth-century Britain was critically informed by an engagement with melancholy. In addition to capturing the psychological and emotional struggles of the age, melancholy is essential to the formal aesthetic of writers like Shelley, Gaskell, Eliot, and Hardy. Elizabeth Gaskell's ""The Poor Clare"" examines the way that melancholy functions as a both a medium of social power and social contagion. In Thomas Hardy's ""Barbara of the House of Grebe,"" melancholy produces an aesthetic crisis, breaking down ontological distinctions between the aesthetic and the real. Mary Shelley's Matilda argues that melancholy lives in language and corrupts speech, while George Eliot's The Lifted Veil uses melancholy to critique to her central aesthetic and ethical values: realism and sympathy. In these works, melancholy is not simply a subjective state romanticized by poets, but a dynamic fully integrated in their aesthetic, without which, they could not write.",,,
1054,Visualizing information flow at the hardware level,"We describe the challenges of analyzing information flow in today's computing systems. The enforcement of information flow policies in modern computer systems is one of the most important aspects of modern computer security, yet it is one of the hardest to get correct in implementation. The security of a system depends on managing the multitudes of interacting devices propagating various types of information. Designers are asked to think about new properties of the system while ensuring that unchecked data does not subvert the integrity of the system at large. The scale and complexity of interaction between different components in hardware and software makes it difficult to reason about how system properties cut across the different layers. As data propagates from one layer to another it changes along the way, generating new data and influencing system behavior. We propose that the visualization of information flow at the hardware level can be used to gain insight into the interaction of components and the non-trivial, non-intuitive dependencies between data and design. To realize this vision we propose a three-step approach: First, we track and collect information on events of interest at the hardware layer and across layers of the software stack. At the hardware layer we present the technique of Backtracking on data to identify the conditions that caused one or more violations. Understanding how information is processed at the gate level gives a microscopic picture of how it is manipulated by the system. To move beyond the physical bounds of hardware and gain a macroscopic view of system behavior, we present Data Flow Tomography. With this tool we capture the footprint of information from the network and registers to software libraries and user space applications. Second, we classify low level events into comprehensible categories. Low level signal changes are mapped to higher order abstractions of the various components. Third, we provide visual representations of these abstractions that enable designers to investigate the behavior of a system at multiple levels. The research in this dissertation focuses on how visualization of the properties of data can aid in understanding the structure and soundness of embedded systems during the design process.",,,
1055,Transport Processes at the Air/Liquid Interface in Microfluidic systems,"The investigation of the transport processes at the interface of liquid and air is important for different chemical and biological applications. Therefore, it is important to understand all transport processes in microfluidic systems which provide great motivations to answer several important scientific questions and help discover new applications. One of the successful microfluidic systems is free-surface microfluidics capable of absorbing airborne molecules in a shallow free-surface microchannel for detection of hazardous gases using Surface Enhanced raman Spectroscopy (SERS). However, full understanding of all transport processes is very complicated in this system. Therefore, we focused on the transport processes such as evaporation, stirring process, and aggregation kinetics in sessile droplets with pinned contact-line. We developed a unified numerical model to find the evaporation rate and internal flows in a sessile droplet with pinned contact-line. The temperature gradient on the interface causes an internal flow due to Marangoni stress, which provides stirring effect. Simultaneously, as the droplet height decreases, the evaporation-induced flow creates a jet-like flow radially towards the contact-line which is responsible for formation of `coffee-ring stain' after evaporation. In addition, we reported a simple polynomial correlation for dimensionless evaporation time as a function of initial contact angle. Finally, the aggregation kinetics of silver nanoparticles in sessile droplets was investigated in order to determine the conditions for optimal SERS detection. The aggregation reaction ceases when the solvent evaporates forming a stain consisting of a high concentration of aggregates which can be interrogated with spectrometer for analyte detection. For a well stirred droplet, the optimal condition for SERS detection was found to be at kcNPtevap = 0.3, which is a product of the dimerization rate constant (k), the concentration of nanoparticles (cNP), and the droplet evaporation time (tevap). Near maximal signal is observed which defines a time window during which trace analytes can be measured. The results of the simulations revealed a very good agreement with experimentally acquired SERS spectra using gas-phase 1,4-BDT as a model analyte. Finally, the detection of Nicotine from breath was performed to prove the ability of this platform for the breath diagnostics.",,,
1056,"Biotic resistance, facilitation and management of novel ecosystems","Humans have altered natural ecosystems such that the biotic and abiotic attributes have greatly changed from the historic ecosystem. One of the ways that these `novel ecosystems' are altered is through the addition of non-native species to communities and ecosystems, thereby altering not only the composition of species but also the species interactions. Novel Ecosystems pose several challenges for managers. First, managers need to understand what community and ecosystem attributes make the system more invasible. Two theories in invasion biology predict why some communities are more invasible than others. First, communities with greater abiotic heterogeneity would support more species; including invasive species, making them more invasible. Second, increased native diversity should decrease the available niche space for new invaders making a community less invasible. In addition, recent research has also demonstrated that native predators provide biotic resistance to invasion, however theory would predict that predators should also facilitate invasions in some circumstances. To test the heterogeneity and diversity hypotheses, we submerged small panels with varying combinations of vertical and horizontal surfaces and varying degrees of species richness off of a floating dock. We found that species diversity and abiotic heterogeneity along with species identity need to be considered together to determine how invasible a community is. To test the hypothesis that apex predators decrease invasions, we submerged caged and uncaged panels on pier pilings. Half of the panels had mussels and the others were left bare. We excluded sea stars from half of the pilings by wrapping bird spikes around the piling bases. We found that both sea stars and otters increased abundance of the non-native bryozoan, Watersipora subtorquata. Inavasive species are one of many threats to marine ecosystems. However, management of novel marine ecosystems must take into consideration all of the potential threats and desired services. In some situations, management actions for desired services may conflict with one another creating tradeoffs while in other situations a management action may have a positive effect on multiple services. To identify optimal management actions and those management actions with tradeoffs, we identified potential services and management actions. We then created a matrix that estimated the effect of one management action across all services. The matrix can be used as a tool for optimizing management of estuarine ecosystems.",,,
1057,Field-theoretic studies of phase coexistence and supramolecular assembly in block copolymers,"Field-theoretic methods for studying supramolecular self-assembly in multiblock copolymer melts are developed. The reversibility of noncovalent bonds in supramolecular assemblies allows for environmental control (temperature, pH, etc.) over reaction equilibrium. When chemically distinct polymers are linked, environmental and stoichiometric control over the bonding is used to select from a variety of phase behaviors including macrophase separation into homogeneous phases, microphase separation into ordered mesophases, coexistence of homogeneous phases and ordered mesophases, and coexistence of ordered mesophases that differ in composition and possibly structure. The formalism for describing the gelation and macro- and microphase separation behavior of binary melts of A and B star-shaped polymers that reversibly bond to form copolymer networks is obtained by incorporating a graphical representation of polymers as trees into a grand canonical ensemble field-theoretic model of continuous Gaussian chains. The enumeration of clusters of different isomeric forms and compositions takes place via generating functions that are a system of nonlinear, transcendental, integral equations. The integral equations are turned into purely algebraic equations by making use of the random phase approximation (RPA). The macro- and microphase separation separation and gelation behavior is first investigated for heterogeneously bonded networks, and, later, the methodology is applied to calculate the melt phase behavior of polyester elastomers. A new computational technique is developed to investigate the phase behavior of melts of multiple polymer species based on an intensive formulation of the Gibbs ensemble SCFT method. The intensive formulation allows constituent mesophases of macrophase separated systems to be represented by single representative unit cells. The compositions of coexisting phases in equilibrium are found by minimizing the intensive free energy of the overall system with respect to the compositions within each cell. The solutions are restricted to those where the mass conservation constraints and the volumetric constraints between coexisting phases are satisfied. The Gibb ensemble SCFT method is extended to supramolecular self-assembly by developing a canonical formalism for reversibly bonded multiblock copolymers. The case of AB diblock copolymers that reversibly react at their B termini with monofunctional B homopolymers to produce longer ABB diblock copolymers is specifically addressed with the new methodology.",,,
1058,A broadband LED on the hybrid silicon platform using multiple die bonding and quantum well intermixing,"Bandwidth has been one of the drivers in photonic sources and will very likely remain one of them. Higher bandwidth sources would not only be useful in data and telecommunication but also in other fields such as gas sensing and optical coherence tomography, a microscopic technique. As silicon photonics offers a great prospect with the supreme CMOS technology, we focused on a broadband source on silicon. To circumvent the indirect silicon band gap, InP epitaxial stacks were bonded. More precisely, two stack were bonded, each of which were subjected to quantum well intermixing (QWI). This way, four different band gaps were created. The fabrication process consists of three stages: QWI, multiple die bonding and the post bond process. Problems were identified and addressed in each of them. Most prominent were phosphorus evaporation during the thermal anneal in QWI, for which a dielectric cap layer should be used and the size and protection of the gap region in between the two bonded dies, for which a protective oxide was introduced. The laser structures on the die at 1540nm were comparable to other devices from our group. The intermixed devices had a higher threshold, indicating a limited but noticeable damage to the quantum wells. The other die did not produce lasers because of a bad P contact. By combining the different band gaps - 1540nm, 1460nm, 1380nm and 1300nm - in a series manner approximately 300nm of 3dB bandwidth was achieved. When organizing the band gaps in the order given, a one directional devices is formed which output at the right. Note that the light at 1540nm will travel through all the other transparent regions. We noticed that the longest wavelengths were not measured, probably because of highly asymmetric below band gap gain from the following section. Nonetheless, 300nm of 3dB bandwidth is a result most other broadbanding techniques are only able to achieve after thorough optimizing of all parameters.",,,
1059,Privacy Expectations in Online Contexts,"Advances in digital networked communication technology over the last two decades have brought the issue of personal privacy into sharper focus within contemporary public discourse. In this dissertation, I explain the Fourth Amendment and the role that privacy expectations play in the constitutional protection of personal privacy generally, and then narrow the focus on this issue to the context of social networking sites. For the legal protection of personal privacy under the Fourth Amendment, a person must have what courts term ""a reasonable expectation of privacy."" For an expectation of privacy in a given context to be deemed reasonable, society must consider that expectation as reasonable, yet no empirical research has explored what society would consider to be a reasonable expectation of privacy in online contexts. I argue that in order to make decisions about societal privacy expectations, judges should rely on social science data to determine what society considers as being reasonable expectations of privacy within any given context, including online. I further argue that by using social science theories of privacy and protection, it is possible to predict people's privacy expectations in online contexts. More specifically, I suggest that based on research on privacy in various social science disciplines, people's normative expectations of privacy depend on what information they think is observable in specific situations. Findings from this study support the notion that people have lower expectations of privacy when they believe their information to be more readily observable, and the results highlight the complicated nature of privacy expectations in the social networking context in particular. A model was proposed in this dissertation to explore how people's privacy expectations differ depending on the audience for their personal information, and it was found that within the context of social networking sites, the factors that contribute to different types of privacy expectations (i.e., the privacy expectations surrounding different potential audiences for one's information) vary widely. That is, some privacy protection behaviors (implementing privacy settings) influence privacy expectations about the degree to which other social networking site (SNS) users should have access to one's personal information, whereas other privacy protection behaviors (reading a site's privacy policies) affect privacy expectations regarding what information people expect law enforcement officers to have access to in SNSs. Similarly, the factors that were hypothesized in the model to influence privacy protection behaviors, including for example, past experience using SNS, personality, and demographic variables, functioned differently depending on the type of privacy expectation. Implications of these results for law and policy are discussed, as are avenues for future research to investigate the role of privacy expectations in the broader privacy literature, both offline and online.",,,
1060,Understanding climate impacts on Mexican rainfed maize,"Climate change and shifting variability patterns are expected to affect the worldwide productivity of crops and hence the food supply. The case of maize in Mexico is interesting because its production is of capital importance to the country's culture and economy, being also the staple crop for most subsistence farmers. Maize crops account for 40% of the country's arable land, and 65% of the total maize production happens under rainfed regime. This dissertation addresses, via three independent studies, the uncertainties associated with current climate variability and change in Mexico and the impacts on rainfed maize production. In Chapter 1 I defined a set of climate parameters relevant for maize production, evaluated their trends over six decades, and investigated the potential influence of large-scale climate teleconnection patterns. In Chapter 2 I assessed the impact of climate variability on state-level maize yield anomalies. Three decades of seasonal observations were used to fit multiple regression models, in which geographical differences of agro-climate conditions selectively defined the set of predictors for each state. Finally, in Chapter 3 I propose a new statistical framework to assess the impacts of climate stressors on maize crops. Using municipalities as spatial units and observations over four growing seasons, the occurrence of crop failure was modeled as a function of climate stressors specific to each stage of the growing period. In brief, significant portions of Mexico experience trends towards climate conditions potentially hazardous for maize growth, such as increasing dryness, delayed rainy seasons, more extreme precipitation and heat stress events. However, predictability could be improved by further understanding of the driving roles played by both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans on Mexico's climate. The state-level regression models show that climate variability affects maize yields differently across the country, and the varying sensitivity could be associated not only to region-specific climates but also to the heterogeneity of production scales, adaptation practices, and reliability of yield reports. Lastly, statistical modeling of crop failure considering stage-specific climate stressors offers a potentially robust alternative to process-based crop models, as the effect of main stressors such as drought and excessive heat was successfully represented.",,,
1061,"The Molecular Age: The Aesthetics of Vital Matter in Literature, Science, and Media","This dissertation presents a series of studies in the aesthetics of vital matter, examining their trans-corporeality in a range of cultural artifacts produced by what Nikolas Rose has come to call the ""molecularization of vitality"" (13). In The Politics of Life Itself, Rose discusses molecularity as a mode or practice, a way of imagining a new vitality and permeability between bodies that now is open to aesthetic-political analysis. This vitality, Rose argues, is related to the new mobility of vital elements, the ways in which ""Molecularization strips tissues, proteins, molecules and drugs of their specific affinities... and enables them to be regarded, in many respects, as manipulable, and transferable elements or units, which can be delocalized---moved from place to place, from organism to organism, from disease to disease, from person to person (15). Rose suggests molecularity as a style of thought, a new intelligibility and transparency about the compositional makeup of bodies. Molecularization became not just a style of thought, but also a technique of optimization and enhancement (15), a technique which refuted the reductionism and oversimplifying of dynamic biological systems. Together, these theoretical explorations of the molecule suggest its power lays in its unprecedented specificity, one that has peaked the interests of scholars from biopolitics to aesthetics. Molecules are data, but they also are complex arrangements with behaviors, shapes, and forms. What occurs when we take on a ""molecular"" gaze is an even-ing of playing fields in a sense. Scientific advances in molecular technologies have produced a molecular imaginary that involves new modes of perceiving between things. As a kinesthetic paradigm, molecular modes of perceiving or sensing which emerge from modern molecular biology have altered the framework for a certain vitalist aesthetic. Research within systems and synthetic biology signal a new future of vital states, constantly being regulated, reorganized, and most importantly, customized for consumption. This aesthetic is both uncertain and non-human, an exploration of how agency manifests at a wide variety of scales and between a wide variety of objects. The texts examined in the dissertation belong to no exclusive pre-established literary moment though most are taken from Anglo-American culture in the modernist moment into the 21st century. They are gathered to consider how molecularity produces different disciplinary domains, particularly since New Materialist critique has increasingly called upon scholarship to provide a more associative landscape for not just analyzing material bodies, but also mobilizing them. What, then, does cancer, J.G. Ballard's psychotropic houses, xray crystallography, the electric chair, transgenic mice, poetry about reproductive technologies, Leopold Bloom's dromomania, Bertha's bliss, protocell technology, and systems architecture have to do with each other? The intervention of the dissertation is not so much the theoretical framework by itself, but that the theoretical framework demands a reorganization of how we mobilize a range of cultural artifacts through a transversal mode of molecular thinking. As either agents, texts, or states of matter, these eco-materialist texts that all problematize the natural/culture divide as well as challenge our notions of species, subjectivity, and body-making. Moreover, they tread on the affective space of an uncertain vitalism. It is not as if now we live in the molecular age, as in, we are living in a new age where everything is customizable, transparent, ready to be turned into scientific data and quantified. It is this for sure, but this is nothing new, in fact, we are arguably at the ""peak"" of the molecular age and biopolitics in contemporary discourse. Instead, the provocation of the molecular age lies in that it marks the age of the indiscernible subject, the indiscernible organism, the indiscernible feeling, the indiscernible machine, the uncertain vitality lingering off the shoots of a downed wire during Hurricane Sandy, the poem-turned-karyotype of an unborn baby, the DNA-less oil that sheds skin for landscaping properties in systems architecture. These are uncertain vitalities. They experiment with matter that differentiates, morphs, and perhaps has sentience, homeostasis, movement, behavior, etc. What's more, and this is a discussion largely missing from new materialist criticism on scientific matter, they have aesthetic histories. From William Morris' treatises on the organic ornamental to Democritus' theories on atomism, the dissertation offers arguments to motivate further research on aesthetic histories of new vitalities highlighted by scientific discoveries. The organizing questions for the dissertation ask how does molecular thinking activate perceptions of vital matter, how are then those perceptions realized in molecular aesthetics, and lastly, what do these molecular aesthetics tell us about key questions of agency that haunt vitalist debates?",,,
1062,"Beyond Media Imperialism: Bolivarian Media Politics, Practices and Programming Under Chavez","In this dissertation, I examine Bolivarian media during the Presidency of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez Frias (1998--2013), leader of the Bolivarian Revolutionary project. Analyzing both ALBA (Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas) and opposition discourses, I consider the importance of consolidating a counter-hegemonic media presence as well as state media policies and the transnational and global political infrastructure of the Caracas-based, multi-state satellite TeleSUR (Television of the South) television network. I also textually analyze the practices of some of TeleSUR's programs to demonstrate the way in which the network contributes to the hyperbolic and ubiquitous presence of Chavez in the media and its use of cultural programming to define the focus of a Global South cultural agenda. I suggest that TeleSUR is part of an emergent model of national media systems, which in the context of neoliberal globalization, resists the global media hegemony of the West in new transnational maneuvers through new alliances with regional and global actors across Internet, cable and satellite platforms and its promotion of ALBA. One of the geopolitical goals of the TeleSUR initiative is to build an enduring regional and global infrastructure through these media platforms to challenge the Global Northern media monopoly on many fronts, resulting in what I argue is an incipient Global South ""nation-building"" project, imbricated in regional, national, transnational and local identities. But to build this infrastructure, the Bolivarian state is using an antiquated, bureaucratic anti-imperialist rhetoric at a time when the world is made up of a heterodox assemblage of political actors and declining U.S. hegemony. I argue, then, that there is a need for a rethinking of the ""media imperialism"" thesis of communication studies, one congruent with the vagaries and vicissitudes of global imbalances and shifting power blocs.",,,
1063,"Neogene Tectonic Evolution of the NE Pamir margin, NW China","Deformation within the Pamir and Tian Shan in Central Asia has been ongoing during the Cenozoic as a result of the Indo-Eurasian collision. The timing and rates of deformation along the NE Pamir margin have been largely unconstrained until recently. This dissertation presents a synthesis of new structural mapping, stratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, cosmogenic radionuclide (TCN) burial and depth profile dating, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, and topographic surveys of deformed Quaternary surfaces, to understand the tectonic evolution of the NE Pamir margin since ~20 Ma. Two geochronologic techniques, OSL and TCN, are applied to determine the timing and slip/shortening rates of faults and folds in the Pamir and Tian Shan forelands. Deformed fluvial terraces crossing active structures record Late Quaternary deformation. Traditionally, silt quartz has been used to date fluvial terraces using OSL. However, OSL dating on fine-sand, in conjunction with appropriate age models, yielded stratigraphically consistent ages that also agree with TCN depth profile ages whereas silt ages overestimate the terrace age by 50%. Commonly, coarse-grained basin fills and syntectonic growth strata adjacent to growing structures may be difficult to date. Eight new 26Al/10Be cosmogenic burial ages on syntectonic growth strata and basin fills, in conjunction with magnetostratigraphic sections, provide new initiation ages and shortening rates for several key structures in the region. Modeling of post-burial nuclide production suggests burial ages may be perturbed up to 60% due to Late Quaternary incision of rivers, whereas synburial production is negligible in these rapidly accumulating basins. The new ages document the basinward growth and eastward propagation of deformation of the Pamir and Tian Shan. Piggyback basin sediments in the hanging wall of the frontal fault of the Pamir record coeval deformation since ~10 Ma. Deformation propagated northward and eastward into the Tarim Basin as the collision with the Tian Shan progressed. Similar to the Tian Shan, coeval deformation on hinterland and basinward structures appeared to play an important role in accommodating shortening along the NE Pamir margin. During the Late Quaternary, much of the deformation is accommodated on the frontal faults, with shortening rates 6-8 mm/a, consistent with the current geodetic rate.",,,
1064,Spatially Adaptive Numerical Methods for Stochastic Biophysical Processes,"We develop spatially adaptive numerical methods for two distinct stochastic physical systems. The first is a model for the kinetics of supported lipid bilayer formation by the adsorption and rupture of lipid vesicles onto a solid substrate. We model the adsorption process taking into account the distinct vesicle rupture events and growth processes. This includes (i) the initial adhesion and vesicle rupture that nucleates bilayer islands, (ii) the growth and merger of bilayer islands, (iii) enhanced adhesion of vesicles to the bilayer edge, and (iv) the final desorption of excess vesicles from the substrate. These simulation studies give insight into prior experimental observations of adsorption in which an overloading of lipid on the solid substrate occurs before formation of the final supported lipid bilayer. Our model provides an explanation for the features of the interesting universal master curve that was observed for the surface fluorescence intensity in the experimental investigations of Weirich et. al. The second method describes a model for fluid-structure interactions when subject to thermal fluctuations through a mixed finite element discretization. These are developed for incompressible Stokes flow with properties that facilitate the introduction of stochastic driving fields to account for thermal fluctuations in a manner consistent with statistical mechanics. To generate the stochastic driving fields efficiently, we develop stochastic iterative methods having O(N) computational complexity. Our approach provides an alternative to uniform discretizations on periodic domains and FFTs. Our stochastic numerical methods allow for spatially adaptive simulations of fluid-structure interactions subject to thermal fluctuations in the presence of walls with no-slip boundary conditions and on domains having complex geometries.",,,
1065,"Integrating Space and Place into Children's Perceptions of Environmental Health Hazards in Accra, Ghana","Health in the developing world is becoming particularly complex due to disparate economic and environmental contexts residing in close spatial proximity, each paving the way for widely different environmental health hazards resulting in acute and chronic illness. In navigating this increasingly heterogeneous landscape, children in Accra, Ghana face multiple types of environmental health hazards as they travel from home, to school, to friends' houses, and to visit family. A child-in-home, or even child-in-neighborhood model of third world urban health hazards cannot account for the complexity of hazards and health threats faced by children on a daily basis. Yet children in Accra, particularly as they move out of their especially vulnerable early years, manage to navigate and mitigate health hazards. Little is known about how children perceive environmental health hazards: their spatially situated knowledge of hazards within daily environments may lead to a better understanding of how space and place drive human-environment health interactions. Furthermore, numerous studies have demonstrated that children in both the developed and developing world are acting with increased agency regarding health. This research proposes to advance the health geography, environmental health, and health education literature by working with children from three diverse contextual backgrounds in a developing third world city to examine verbal, visual, and spatial perceptions of health and environmental health hazards. The dissertation does this by establishing baseline differences of children and adult's perceptions of children's health, testing child-friendly visual methods of assessing health knowledge, and developing a novel method of assessing spatial patterns of health perceptions through GPS and photography. Results indicate that children in Accra have distinct, and often varying, perceptions of health when compared to adults and across socioeconomic groups. Photographic methods that contextualize health are good measures of health knowledge and perceptions. Furthermore, placing health perceptions in space as children move through the environment sheds light on spatial properties of health perceptions, such as health related landmarks, and regional categorization of spaces into healthy and unhealthy places.",,,
1066,Sustaining Innovation: Developing an Instructional Technology Assessment Process,"This case study developed an instructional technology assessment process for the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education (GGSE). The theoretical framework of Adelman and Taylor (2001) guided the development of this instructional technology assessment process and the tools to aid in its facilitation. GGSE faculty, staff, and graduate students responded to a technology questionnaire that sought to gather data about their current satisfaction with the School's technology infrastructure, their preferences for future training and technology investments, and their understanding and use of current classroom, research, and administrative technologies. With an overall participation rate of 65% faculty, 64% staff, and 22% of students the questionnaire strategy of assessment seems to be a viable method of collecting technology related data. Findings from the questionnaire revealed that most faculty, staff, and graduate student respondents were highly satisfied with the GGSE's Information Technology Group (ITG) as their main resource for technology help and guidance, however, Academic Technology Specialists (ATS) had the lowest use for faculty, 0% use by staff, and lowest use for student respondents. All three stakeholder groups have the strongest priority for spending technology monies for technology within ""support"" and ""research software training."" Some stakeholders expressed an overall desire for definitions of technology tools and services listed on the questionnaire to provide clarification for their responses. The frequent need for clarification shows that some stakeholders are not taking full advantage of some technologies and services available to them because they do not know they exist or how to access them. This institutional study is considered a case study for a future longitudinal study to investigate the effectiveness of the GGSE assessment process as a method of sustaining innovations and the satisfaction levels of stakeholders. The intended audience for this assessment development project is college technology leaders interested in creating their own technology assessment process.",,,
1067,Stellar explosions from accreting white dwarfs,"Unstable thermonuclear burning on accreting white dwarfs (WDs) can lead to a wide variety of outcomes, and induce shock waves in several contexts. In classical and recurrent novae, a WD accreting hydrogen-rich material from a binary companion can experience thermonuclear runaways, ejecting mass into the interstellar/circumbinary environment at ~1000 km/s. This highly supersonic ejecta drives shock waves into the interstellar gas which may be relevant for sweeping out gas from globular clusters or forming circumstellar absorption regions in interacting supernovae. While runaway nuclear burning in novae releases enough energy for these objects to brighten by a factor of ~10 4 over roughly a weeklong outburst, it does not become dynamically unstable. In contrast, certain helium accretion scenarios may allow for dynamical burning modes, in part due to the higher temperature sensitivity of helium burning reactions and larger accreted envelopes. The majority of this thesis involves such dynamical burning modes, specifically detonations - shock waves sustained by nuclear energy release behind the shock front. We investigate when steady-state detonations are realizable in accreted helium layers on WDs, and model their strength and burning products using both semi-analytic and numerical models. We find the minimum helium layer thickness that will sustain a steady laterally propagating detonation and show that it depends on the density and composition of the helium layer, specifically 12 C and 16O. Though gravitationally unbound, the ashes still have unburned helium (~80% in the thinnest cases) and only reach up to heavy elements such as 40Ca, 44Ti, 48Cr, and 52Fe. It is rare for these thin shells to generate large amounts of radioactive isotopes necessary to power light curves, such as 56Ni. This has important implications on whether the unbound helium burning ashes may create faint and fast peculiar supernovae or events with virtually no radioactivity, as well as on off-center ignition of the underlying WD in the double detonation scenario for Type Ia supernovae.",,,
1068,Stability and Change in Travel Behavior and the Built Environment,"The study of dynamic travel behavior explores the individual and environmental triggers that drive new travel patterns over the life course. In the context of urban planning, these triggers hold vital information regarding the strength of land use policies and demographic shifts on individual responses to public investments in smart growth planning. This study describes a new approach to identifying drivers for change using the life-course behavioral framework to describe dynamics in task allocation over the individuals' lifetime. Using longitudinal travel behavior and land use data from the Puget Sound region, years 1989--2000, and latent growth modeling, the study finds that part of behavioral change is explained by yearly changes and part is explained by long-term planning and adaptation to changes in the household structure, such as having children. In addition to the study of individual behavior, the dynamics of the built environment are examined in the context of smart growth planning and the jobs-housing balance. Smart growth planning in the Puget Sound attempts to create a jobs-housing balance by intensifying and diversifying residents and businesses in 26 regional growth centers. The success of these planned centers to meet the jobs-housing needs is measured using commuting behavior of the center residents for 2010. Using the National Establishments Time Series dataset, centers with high levels of professional employment (~65%) and low levels of retail employment (~30%) have short commute times and low levels of single-occupancy commutes.",,,
1069,The Decline of Moral and Political Authority: Mainstream Protestants in McCarthyite America,"The early Cold War in the United States had a religious dimension, but not merely between ""Godless Communism"" and the Judeo-Christian West. Equally important, and of continuing significance, this era marked an internal battle within the American mainstream churches, a political and theological conflict that weakened the Social Gospel tradition and opened the door to the revival of a highly nationalistic and evangelical Protestantism. The mainline Protestant elite was surprised to find its loyalty questioned and reacted by distancing itself from its more radical adherents. Because of its very prestige and establishmentarian character in American politics, it adapted less effectively in the Cold War context than did Catholics, Evangelicals, and Fundamentalists, who organized as outsiders seeking political influence. This dissertation examines this paradox: how a liberal Protestant establishment that believed it still held cultural and political authority nevertheless felt forced to demonstrate its national loyalty in competition with other religious groups. During the first decade of the Cold War the domestic definition of acceptable religious belief and practice became entwined with that of national loyalty, and thus subject to intense national debate. Church membership grew rapidly after 1945, as did public religiosity, symbolized by the 1954 insertion of ""under God"" into the Pledge of Allegiance. Political leaders encouraged attempts to define America as a religious nation, and to link its founders and democratic political system to Christian doctrine. This effort to make religious belief a bulwark of patriotic loyalty in an era of expanding religious pluralism challenged the traditional status of many liberal Protestants. These individuals faced scrutiny for having previously embraced social action, as well as their past critiques of American capitalism, cooperation with Popular Front radicals, and defense of the New Deal state and its labor partisans. By the mid-1950s, denunciations of ""Reds in the Churches"" had taken a toll on the moral authority and social prestige of even the most influential and established U.S. churches.",,,
1070,An Investigation in Decision Making and Destination Choice Incorporating Place Meaning and Social Network Influences,"Travel demand models in the field of transportation have become increasingly sophisticated through the past several decades. The use of activity based modeling methods requires the integration of highly detailed information with statistical models but still substantial variation is unobserved. The pursuit of richer and more accurate models requires thinking outside of the proverbial box, and extending our research into various directions. This dissertation examines the process of destination choice, and the potential influence of place meaning and social networks in the process and in our ability to computationally replicate and predict behavior. Aspects of place meaning are examined, including different geographical aggregations, and the contributions of several theories such as sense of place. In addition, the role of individuals as decision makers is examined, in an attempt to determine whether there are different situations in which an individual's preferences or attitudes have more weight in the decision process. The research presented in this dissertation is motivated by the theoretical assumptions and underpinnings of the discrete choice framework. Misspecification of choice models can lead to incorrect estimations, or biased parameters. It is therefore important to take care in specifying the models as accurately as possible to the actual decision process, and not relying on a stochastic error term to correct for any absent information. Although this work is framed by the discrete choice framework, the implications of the research also apply to broader domains in planning. Results show that we can and should include sense of place attributes in a quantitative manner in modeling behavior. In addition, attitudes and perceptions of attributes of place can be used to challenge current assessments of accessibility and attraction to parts of a region. Though sense of place is a well-founded and widely discussed theory, there is still a considerable amount of work to do in capturing the emotional aspects of place in a quantitative manner. The work in this dissertation also explores the potential and shortfalls of the quantification of sense of place, and how we might better incorporated the phenomenon in models of decision-making. Lastly, findings of research conducted on the influence of social networks on decision making show that there is a wide range of cooperative decision making strategies, and as such, we must be more careful to model the influence of individuals in decision making more accurately.",,,
1072,Conjugate Systems Utilizing Roussin's Salts for Nitric Oxide Delivery,"Therapeutic noninvasive drug delivery methods are desired as a means of simplifying medical procedures. This dissertation focuses mainly on utilizing light as the trigger for photochemical delivery of nitric oxide, a bioactive gaseous molecule. Relatively non-toxic delivery systems triggered by near infrared light are explored. The ideal wavelengths of light that penetrate biological organisms must take into account the various tissue components such as water, fat, and muscle content. The wavelength range best capable of not being absorbed by the previously mentioned tissues is situated in the near infrared from 650 to 1350 nm. It is noted that particular tissues have different extinction coefficients at various wavelengths. Light is an ideal trigger for photochemical release of a drug due to its ability to be pulsed, focused, or mixed with other wavelengths, allowing temporal, spatial, dosage control. The nitric oxide delivery systems explored in this dissertation were based on sequential multi-photon absorption of 980 nm light by lanthanide ions within crystal nanoparticles, which then upconvert the light into shorter wavelengths utilized to trigger the photochemical release of nitric oxide. The first delivery system consisted of meso-porous silica coated upconverting nanoparticles loaded with the nitric oxide precursor Roussin's Black Salt anion Fe4S3(NO)7-. The nanoparticles were dispersed in aqueous media and irradiated with 980 nm light and the nitric oxide released was determined by a Sievers based detection system. Such a system holds future promise due to its ability to be injected. The second method explored is a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film loaded with upconverting nanoparticles and infused with Roussin's Black Salt. This latter system was also irradiated with 980 nm light in a helium environment and the nitric oxide released was determined. The polydimethylsiloxane film method was explored further by placing them behind approximately 2.5 mm porcine tissue samples of muscle, fat or skin, then irradiated with 980 nm diode laser light. Interestingly, sufficient nitric oxide was released demonstrating the viability of material systems to encapsulate photochemical biological precursors.",,,
1073,University Internationalization: A Case Study on Faculty International Programming,"Despite the complexity university internationalization presents, university faculty members have contributed and continue to contribute to internationalization in impactful ways. To examine one aspect of faculty contribution to university internationalization, this exploratory case study focused on short-term faculty international programming as it drew upon the examination of an institutional context. Experiences of internationally engaged faculty members of two different academic areas at one research institution were collected through in-depth interviewing to examine international programming practices. Results of this study suggested that the institutional context influenced international programming as it both hindered and enabled faculty practices. It also suggested that program typology was dependent on faculty availability, financial resources and creativity. Additional findings touched upon the importance of departmental support for faculty international programming, faculty professional development to enhance international programming and the impact of fragmented international structures on university internationalization efforts and initiatives.",,,
1074,Unity and the Struggle of Opposites: The Evolving New York City Filipino Left,"My main research questions explore how contradictions of unity, organizing structures, gender, sexuality, citizenship, class, and ability are addressed within Filipino leftist organizations that utilize dialectical materialist theory. I also ask: How have US-based women of color feminist and queer of color theory impacted Filipino nationalist frameworks in the US? How do they also remain at odds with one another? I interviewed 21 NYC-based activists and organizers involved in anti-imperialist Filipino organizations the summer of 2012. I also used participant observation as an active member of study groups, educational workshops, and a town forum. My central framework explores conflict as contradiction using Mao Tse-tung's ""On Contradiction"" and the Haitian concepts of balans and konesans. In doing so, I examine how hard-lined leadership has impeded dialogue. I also interrogate how sexism, transphobia, masculinist organizing structures, and neoliberalism impact women, trans, queer, disabled, working class, and undocumented organizers---particularly those with overlapping identities of marginalization. ""The Movement's"" familial dynamic, combined with the value of utang na loob, creates hierarchies that cause some members to feel both silenced and guilty. I name these feelings as indicators of invisible emotional labor ""for the sake of the movement"" that lead many members to eventually leave their organizations. Their departures raise questions of sustainability. Lastly, I ask how the Fil-Am Left can draw strength from its familial dynamic but still address hierarchical issues that mirror societal hierarchies of oppression. Applying work by Patricia Hill Collins, Audre Lorde, and other women of color, along with feminist grounded theory and sociological movement theory, I highlight three strategies that New York City based Filipino organizations have taken within the past ten years. I argue that organizations have recognized problems with sustainability and are creating their own interventions as theory-producers. Organizers' relationships to the National Democratic movement in the Philippines shape both the creation of interventions and how they respond to new ideas. Drawing on Arlie Hoschchild's concept of ""stalled revolution,"" individual behaviors lag behind organizations' formal ideological shifts. Thus, they are works in progress.",,,
1075,California's Movement to Legalize Marijuana: Discursive Opportunity Structures in Prop 19,"In the 2010 midterm elections, California voters decided on Proposition 19, The Control, Regulate, and Tax Cannabis Act of 2010. The ballot initiative contested the criminal legality of cannabis use, yet it also challenged the social construction of the marijuana user. Leaders for and against Prop 19 employed familiar discourses embedded in political and cultural texts, such as legal documents, political speeches, public service announcements, and films. What discourses were available and how social activists interpreted their meanings is the subject of this study. I examine the ways that the symbolism of slogans such as the ""War on Drugs"" affected the choices of leaders for and against Prop 19. The units of analysis are the imagery and language employed by campaign leaders, representatives of social movement organizations (SMOs), marijuana reform activists, and professionals in law, criminal justice, and politics. Proponents of marijuana legalization argued that ""just saying no"" is flawed public policy, while opponents employed prohibitionist language to support U.S. drug laws. Other culturally-embedded discourses---such as public safety, individualism, the budget crisis, drinking-and-driving, the medical marijuana patient, and ""stoners""---influenced the framing processes of both sides of the debate. I use direct and participant observation, document analysis, and interviews to analyze the discursive environment that shaped the proposition's path. I find that the pro- and anti-Prop 19 frames were not produced by strategy alone. Rather, the cultural environment facilitated or constrained leaders' choices, which ultimately affected what messages resonated with voters. California's Proposition 19 was not merely a political campaign with a definitive end. I therefore propose theoretically situating cannabis ballot propositions within the greater social movement that calls for ending the ""War on Drugs."" Studying the interplay of citizen-led initiatives and social movements broadens our understanding of how symbolic language mobilizes political action.",,,
1076,"Capability, environment, and deliberation: Applying the capabilities approach to environmental policy-making and institutional design","In recent years scholars of the capabilities approach (CA) have turned their attention to two important questions: (1) how to integrate the environment into the conceptual framework of the CA, and (2) which political structures are consistent with the CA. I argue that their work is flawed to the extent that they do not address the issue of public deliberation directly, and that this neglect leaves them at a loss to articulate a conception of politics which aims to realize the normative ideal of active and capable democratic citizens. To remedy this, I develop an account of the necessary conditions for good democratic deliberation from Martha Nussbaum's political justification for the CA. This account emphasizes the need for a rich, cognitively diverse information environment, observance of deliberative norms of mutual respect, sympathetic listening, and a shared concern for the common good (as opposed to individual or group interest), and adequate opportunities for citizens to develop the capacities associated with democratic deliberation and citizenship. With regard to environmental policy-making, I argue that the reliance on the ecosystem services approach (ES) by CA theorists is problematic since it cannot incorporate the multiple ""ways of knowing"" about ecosystems present in the ecological sciences, and cannot draw upon sufficient empirical data to make policy recommendations. In light of this, I advocate for a deliberative policy-making process, one which brings experts and lay citizens into dialogue with each other. This raises the question: how are lay citizens to judge competing expert claims? I argue that citizens can use the criteria of ""fidelity to representation"" as a guide in assessing the quality of the discourses in which these claims are embedded, since they lack the expertise to judge particular expert claims regarding climate change, the effects of pollution, and so on. With regard to political institutions, I argue that CA theorists should pay more attention to electoral institutions based on proportional representation (PR) and deliberative mini-publics, as an analysis of the scholarly literature on these institutions suggests that they facilitate the conditions for deliberation and judgment I derived from Nussbaum's account of the CA.",,,
1077,The Qur'an According to Ibn Taymiyya: Redefining Exegetical Authority in the Islamic Tradition,"By challenging the discursive scholarly tradition, and attempting to return to another type of tradition (i.e., the early generations of Muslims) Ibn Taymiyya carved a niche in Islamic intellectual history as a thinker who worked outside of the standard genre of running Qur'an commentaries and redefined what exegesis should be. He argued that legitimate interpretation of the Qur'an should rely on intra-textual relations within the Qur'an, reports of the Prophet Muhammad, and reports of the early Muslims, the salaf. My dissertation suggests that although Ibn Taymiyya's Muqaddima fi us&dotbelow;ul al-tafsir (Treatise on the Principles of Qur'anic Interpretation) articulates a system for performing qur'anic exegesis, it proves difficult to find a definitive method that he consistently employs in his exegetical writings. Ibn Taymiyya often applies general principles from his Treatise but not always systematically or exhaustively. To fully apply his ambitious vision for interpreting the Qur'an, one would require an exhaustive appendix of reports from the salaf and Prophet that bear on exegesis, which he admits does not exist. The challenge, then, asks exegetes to find relevant and reliable reports while applying them to particular verses in the Qur'an. Although one might consider Ibn Taymiyya's method to fall under the category of ""tafsir bi-l-ma'thur"" (exegesis according to tradition), I argue that his exegesis in practice indicates something more flexible. He applies a tempered freedom to interpret the Qur'an based on scholarly discretion, which I demonstrate in the second chapter and third chapters by way of examining his views on Pharaoh's faith, Sufism, and the soteriological fate of non-Muslims. Even though Ibn Taymiyya's writings on the Qur'an were but a small portion of his work, examining these writings and their underlying hermeneutics offers a window into the foundations of his epistemology and broader intellectual concerns. In the final chapter, moreover, I draw parallels with Ibn Taymiyya's articulation of normative authority and contemporary qur'anic studies scholars. Although these scholars---many of whom are non-Muslims---operate in different socio-historical context, I demonstrate how their desires to interpret the Qur'an correctly nonetheless reflect similar concerns held by Ibn Taymiyya many centuries ago.",,,
1078,"Ay Tijuana mi Tijuanita: una iconografia de ciudad, desde las formas breves literarias y extraliterarias","This study analyses and deconstructs the representations of the border and the city of Tijuana through an iconographic approximation. Amongst the many representations of Tijuana there are recurring themes, such as poverty, violence, drugs and prostitution. This study is centered around the character/icon that stands as the masculine archetype of the border: the bandit from the mid XIX century to the beginning of the XX, revolutionary during the XX century, and narco (drug lord) by the end of the XX century and beginning of the XXI. Most of these representations are external in origin and usually follow the parameters of brevity. Some examples are pictures from Battles in Tijuana, tourist postcards, corridos (folklore songs), poems, short stories and American Dime Novels. For almost 200 years, the identity of Tijuana was held hostage by outsider representations. In response, Tijuana developed a new form of representation: a divergent aesthetic. Some of the first exemplars of internal representation regurgitate the simulacra imposed by the external---two-dimensional imaginaries of border identity---but this was due to two main reasons: the need for a homogeneous identity and that this identity caricatured the border and made it more attractive to American tourists, it was simply economically beneficial. There internal representations follow a divergent aesthetic. In the realm of expression or content they follow the guidelines of short form fiction, amongst these features they are: serial, fractal, metafictional, intertextual, elliptic, paradoxical, and hybrid genres. In the realm of the content or story they respond to the previous representations by rejecting any loyalty to form. Amongst other characteristics, divergent literatures create their own non-codes, disassociate from the postmodern, prefer crude reality, make tireless use of mass codes and reject canonical ones, they are self-destructive, have no epiphany, suspense is routine, and they cannot achieve a synthesis. Divergent aesthetics compose an activist literature that questions form, genre, and the parameters of the canonical by exposing representational methods that have formed part of the hierarchical structuring of identities and space within the Tijuana border region.",,,
1079,Exploring Inorganic catalytic pathways for Carbon dioxide reduction: Metal-oxide nanowires and Iron sulfide minerals,"The conversion of CO2 to is an attractive possibility for lowering concentrations in Earth's atmosphere since its reduction can yield useful high-energy fuels. TiO2 nanowires have been previously highlighted as attractive catalysts for CO2 conversion. However, the mechanism of nanowire formation by APCVD methods is not well understood which limits their production in bulk. TiO2 nanowire growth experiments were performed using a novel phosphorus-doped seed particle method. Results show phosphorus doping enhances nanowire growth and may be applicable to other metal-oxide nanowire fabrication methods. Although there are current concerns for atmospheric concentrations of CO2, Earth's earliest atmosphere (~4.5 Ga ago) is thought to have been dominated by ~1-10 bar CO2. In equilibrium with Earth's ocean, the reduction of dissolved CO2 in an ancient ocean may have been the earliest pathway for the emergence of life. Ancient alkaline hydrothermal vents, formed by serpentinization of the oceans crust are proposed to be dominated by iron sulfide catalysts that are capable of reducing CO2 toward organic synthesis. Yet, few laboratory experiments have been performed to simulate ancient hydrothermal conditions and test this theory for the earliest emergence of life. Iron sulfide precipitation experiments were performed and show species including mackinawite [FeIIS], proposed as a catalyst in CO2 reduction, which could line the interiors of ancient hydrothermal systems. Additionally, a hydrothermal reactor was assembled and new protocols developed for testing CO2 reduction under simulated ancient alkaline hydrothermal vent temperatures (120C), pressures (~100 bar) and pH conditions. H2-rich hydrothermal simulants were mixed with CO2-rich ancient ocean simulants and allowed to react across ultramafic, and iron sulfide compositions. The resulting mineral compositions and dissolved inorganic species suggest partial serpentinization is occurring during reactor experiments. Dissolved formate, a known intermediate of CO2 reduction to methane, was detected in the resulting solutions. These results suggest that the methods and protocols developed here are uniquely capable of testing the catalytic capability of hydrothermal systems. Since serpentinization can occur anywhere an ocean is in contact with the mineral olivine, these methods may be useful for understanding the alkaline hydrothermal vents that are suggested to exist on other planets in our solar system.",,,
1080,Estimating root-zone soil moisture in the West Africa Sahel using remotely sensed rainfall and vegetation,"Agricultural drought is characterized by shortages in precipitation, large differences between actual and potential evapotranspiration, and soil water deficits that impact crop growth and pasture productivity. Rainfall and other agrometeorological gauge networks in Sub-Saharan Africa are inadequate for drought early warning systems and hence, satellite-based estimates of rainfall and vegetation greenness provide the main sources of information. While a number of studies have described the empirical relationship between rainfall and vegetation greenness, these studies lack a process based approach that includes soil moisture storage. In Chapters I and II, I modeled soil moisture using satellite rainfall inputs and developed a new method for estimating soil moisture with NDVI calibrated to in situ and microwave soil moisture observations. By transforming both NDVI and rainfall into estimates of soil moisture I was able to easily compare these two datasets in a physically meaningful way. In Chapter II, I also show how the new NDVI derived soil moisture can be assimilated into a water balance model that calculates an index of crop water stress. Compared to the analogous rainfall derived estimates of soil moisture and crop stress the NDVI derived estimates were better correlated with millet yields. In Chapter III, I developed a metric for defining growing season drought events that negatively impact millet yields. This metric is based on the data and models used in the Chapters I and II. I then use this metric to evaluate the ability of a sophisticated land surface model to detect drought events. The analysis showed that this particular land surface model's soil moisture estimates do have the potential to benefit the food security and drought early warning communities. With a focus on soil moisture, this dissertation introduced new methods that utilized a variety of data and models for agricultural drought monitoring applications. These new methods facilitate a more quantitative, transparent `convergence of evidence' approach to identifying agricultural drought events that lead to food insecurity. Ideally, these new methods will contribute to better famine early warning and the timely delivery of food aid to reduce the human suffering caused by drought.",,,
1081,CAD Solutions for Preventing Electromigration on Power Grid Interconnects,"Electromigration (EM) is a major reliability problem for on-chip interconnects. With the trend of shrinking wire dimensions and higher current densities, EM concerns emerge. In this thesis, we mainly investigate EM problems in power grids. We provide design guidelines and CAD solutions to improve full-chip EM reliability for power grids. Current density is the most important factor that affects interconnect EM lifetime. We demonstrate that the wildly held belief that the worst grid currents occur when all current sources are turned on is misleading. We study the correlation between current sources and wire currents, and use linear programming to determine true worst case currents on power grid wires. Temperature is another important factor since EM lifetime has an exponential dependency on temperature. In modern designs, wire Joule heating causes a non-negligible temperature rise above substrate, which is not taken into account in many EM reliability check tools. We propose a two stage thermal analysis to efficiently estimate wire temperatures for EM analysis purpose. Today, process variations affect circuit behavior significantly, including EM. We study the effect of chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) dishing and lithography edge placement error (EPE) on EM. Variation tolerance of each wire is determined as a design aid. In power grids, via arrays are widely used for inter-layer connections, their EM behavior is very different from that of a single via. We develop a compact model to quickly determine current distribution in a via array, and numerically obtain via array EM lifetime using Monte-Carlo method. We notice that a power grid provides plenty of redundancy such that not all via arrays are crucial to power integrity. This inherent redundancy allows us to explore the trade-off between EM reliability and power grid integrity. We develop a heuristic power track upsizing algorithm to minimize the extra metal used for EM reliability budget.",,,
1082,Three Essays on Property Rights to Natural Resources and Institutional Change,"Externalities arise when the full costs and benefits of actions are not borne by the actor and, in the absence of governance, self-interested individuals have an incentive to overexploit environmental resources, underprovide public amenities, and underinvest in conservation technology. This dissertation focuses on historical changes to natural resource property institutions and investigates their causes and consequences. The first chapter presents joint work with Gary Libecap and Dean Lueck, which looks at the relative prevalence of rectangular grids and alternative demarcation systems in agricultural land, and investigates the economic factors that explain this variation. We develop a model and test its implications against data from temperate colonies of the British Empire. Three arrangements were implemented: individualized, idiosyncratic metes and bounds; a centralized, uniform rectangular system; and a centralized, non-uniform demarcation system. We find that centralized systems provide coordination benefits, but adoption is less likely when implementation is slow and controlling settlement is costly. Uniform rectangular demarcation lowers transaction costs, but its rigid structure is costly in rugged terrain. The second chapter investigates coordinating effects of rectangular grids in cities. In 1811, Manhattan adopted its iconic rectangular street grid, contrasting with the decentralized, haphazard development of Lower Manhattan. The spatial patterns of both systems are largely persistent today and I exploit the spatial discontinuity in land patterns to estimate the effects of the institutional change. Regression estimates provide evidence that grids significantly increase land values and land use density relative to more haphazard demarcation patterns. The third chapter presents joint work with Claudio Tagliapietra and investigates common management of forests and grazing land by communities in the 18th and 19th-century Italian Alps. While many villages rely on customs to regulate their common property resources, some adopt legal charters, which are then forcefully abolished by Napoleon in the early 19th century. Using archival data, we find that charter villages experience an initial increase in population growth relative to non-charter populations after Napoleon's invasion, followed by a later increase in mortality rates. Combined with historical accounts, this evidence suggests that legal charters were critical for stabilizing communal populations by restraining renewable resource exploitation.",,,
1083,"Learn, Respect, Enjoy On Sex Education in Iran","Sexual health education has, and will continue to be, an issue that the international community confronts regularly. It has been recognized widely that sexual health is an important aspect of reproductive rights, as well psychological and physical well being. In Iran, the same concerns regarding the mental and physical aspects of sexual health exist, however they are severely neglected. Drawing on my own experiences and my research in graduate school, I initiated a project that addresses this disparity of sexual health information in Iran. Taking into account the diversity of the population, and the sensitivity of the discourse, I developed an online platform, in Persian, which the Iranian public could access in order to obtain a fundamental sexual health education that might help them better understand their own circumstances. This report will elaborate on the implementation and progression of this project in greater detail. The logistics of the website's development will be addressed, along with the strategic planning and consultation that helped shape the displayed content. Most importantly, I will demonstrate the effective nature of this project, and how that has evolved throughout the past year. Future plans will include what can make the website a stronger and more applicable source for sexual health education of the Persian speaking population, inside Iran and Afghanistan, and within the diaspora communities.",,,
1084,Universities as Global Actors in the Apparel Supply Chain: The Designated Suppliers Program,"Buyer-driven supply chains of modern capitalism put power into the hands of consumers. In the absence of a unified transnational labor movement, activists focus on mobilizing consumers to push corporations to adopt socially responsible practices. Universities have exclusive power over the multi-billion dollar collegiate apparel market and have used their influence to raise labor standards for ""sweatshop"" workers. Recognizing that monitoring organizations are incapable of examining thousands of factories involved in collegiate apparel production and that pricing practices of apparel brands prevent sustainable increases to labor conditions, student-activists have proposed the Designated Suppliers Program (DSP). Recently cleared by the Department of Justice, the DSP represents an opportunity for universities to ensure that factory workers have stable employment in a dignified workplace while earning a living wage. This would be a fundamental shift in production that could have far reaching impacts on the apparel industry and third-party monitoring. Currently, there is no academic literature on the program (or on the collegiate apparel industry in general), which needs to be placed in the broader context of social movements, labor rights, and global capitalism. The purpose of this thesis is to explore why the DSP has not been successfully implemented since it was first proposed in 2005. Before directly assessing this, the collegiate apparel industry is explored and the history of the DSP is presented. The necessity, desirability, and feasibility of the DSP are evaluated with specific emphasis on the perspective of universities. Ultimately, the study concludes that there are no flaws inherent in the design of the DSP that would prevent successful implementation and the primary reason it is not being pursued by universities is because of a lack of awareness of the program. Student campaigns for the DSP are poised to surge within the year, and along with success of the first factory that meets DSP criteria (Alta Gracia), universities will soon be faced with the task of critically and reflexively considering their position and influence in the global apparel industry.",,,
1085,Redistributed video codec complexity with relaxed latency constraints,"In this dissertation, we develop a video compression scheme that is suited for applications such as UAV video surveillance where the encoder complexity needs to be low, but the decoder complexity can be high. We propose an encoder that uses the global motion information available in UAVs for global motion compensated prediction. This encoder is superior to a complexity-constrained H.264/AVC encoder because it does not need to transmit motion vectors and it replaces the highly complex block motion estimation engine with the relatively simpler global motion compensation. The adoption of global motion compensation in place of the block motion estimation in standard H.264/AVC encoders saves about 40-61% of the bits required to achieve a given frame quality or equivalently achieves BD-PSNR improvements of 1.7--2.7 dB. We also propose a second low complexity encoder with global motion compensation and quantization matrices designed using a spectral entropy based bit allocation scheme that achieves near constant PSNR within groups of pictures at the cost of small increases in delay and complexity, and a small drop in compression efficiency. This encoder has lower complexity and requires 28--46% fewer bits to achieve the same frame quality as a complexity-constrained H.264/AVC encoder. In addition, we design a high complexity decoder that takes advantage of the computational resources and relaxed latency constraints at the ground station to further improve the performance gains of the proposed encoders for non-real-time applications. This decoder utilizes the correlation across frames through a colored observation noise Kalman filter applied along motion trajectories on the transform coefficients reconstructed by the ""matched"" decoder and improves the reconstructed frame quality by 0.1--0.5 dB on average. The proposed compression system consisting of the low complexity encoder and the high complexity decoder achieves about 50% or more bitrate savings or equivalently 2--3 dB BD-PSNR improvement over the complexity-constrained H.264/AVC encoder with a standard-prescribed low complexity decoder. Our proposed approach also provides substantial bitrate savings of 65% or equivalently 4 dB BD-PSNR improvement over the Wyner-Ziv DISCOVER codec, which also has a low complexity encoder and a high complexity decoder. Further, our high complexity decoder can be paired with a low complexity H.264/AVC encoder with motion estimation constrained to 8 x 8 blocks and half pixel accuracy, to improve the frame reconstruction quality by 0.2--0.6 dB on average over the standard-prescribed decoder.",,,
1086,"Deciphering landscape drivers and signatures in tectonically active landscapes using Google Earth imagery, remote sensing, and cosmogenic radionuclides","Understanding how the surface of the Earth records and responds to various climatic, tectonic, erosive, and biotic forcings is at the heart of the geomorphology discipline and requires complex topographic, numerical, and geochemical toolsets to test and evolve current axioms. Google Earth has revolutionized the way people interact with high-spatial resolution imagery across Earth and the solar system, yet has remained largely underutilized to date for making quantitative measurements of landscape form and function. Examples of such utility and potential caveats are demonstrated for quantifying hillslope mass wasting events in Haiti, strike-slip offsets in the eastern California shear zone, and channel planform geometry in the tectonically active Himalaya. More detailed analysis comparing channel widths from Google Earth using the ChanGeom extraction methodology, as developed in this study, with field- and lidar-derived datasets attests to the quality and utility of such methods and provides key information about channel response to tectonic forcings across a host of regimes. Lastly, accurate channel widths are utilized in the Himalaya to derive erosion proxies based on specific stream power estimates and are compared with 60 cosmogenic radionuclide derived erosion rates in the western Himalaya. Within the complex interactions among surface processes, precipitation gradients, and relict topography in the Himalaya, these data indicate that tectonic deformation emerges as the dominant driver of landscape form at the centennial to millennial timescale.",,,
1087,Uncovering Interesting Attributed Anomalies in Large Graphs,"Graph is a fundamental model for capturing entities and their relations in a wide range of applications. Examples of real-world graphs include the Web, social networks, communication networks, intrusion networks, collaboration networks, and biological networks. In recent years, with the proliferation of rich information available for real-world graphs, vertices and edges are often associated with attributes that describe their characteristics and properties. This gives rise to a new type of graphs, namely attributed graphs. Anomaly detection has been extensively studied in many research areas, and finds important applications in real-world tasks such as financial fraud detection, spam detection and cyber security. Anomaly detection in large graphs, especially graphs annotated with attributes, is still under explored. Most of existing work in this aspect focuses on the structural information of the graphs. In this thesis, we aim to address the following questions: How do we define anomalies in large graphs annotated with attributive information? How to mine such anomalies efficiently and effectively? A succinct yet fundamental anomaly definition is introduced: given a graph augmented with vertex attributes, an attributed anomaly refers to a constituent component of the graph, be it a vertex, an edge, or a subgraph, exhibiting abnormal features that deviate from the majority of constituent components of the same nature, in a combined structural and attributive space. For example in a social network, assume there exists a group of people, most of whom share similar taste in movies, whereas the majority of social groups in this network tend to have very diverse interests in movies; or in a collaboration network, there exists a group of closely connected experts that possess a set of required expertise, and such a group occurs scarcely in this network; we consider the groups in both scenarios as ""anomalous"". Applications of this research topic abound, including target marketing, recommendation systems, and social influence analysis. The goal of this work therefore is to create efficient solutions to effectively uncover interesting anomalous patterns in large attributed graphs. In service of this goal, we have developed several frameworks using two types of approaches: (1) combinatorial methods based on graph indexing and querying; (2) statistical methods based on probabilistic models and network regularization.",,,
1088,An evaluation of English versus Spanish language choice during conversation training intervention for children with autism,"In children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, social communication deficits are identified as core developmental impairments. The ability to carry on a conversation through verbal exchanges poses challenges for individuals on the spectrum. The impact of exposure to a multilingual and multicultural environment on children with ASD is unknown and few empirical studies have investigated possible effects. Linguistically and culturally diverse families and settings are complex topics of discussion when addressing the instructional needs of children, including those with special needs. Controversy in bilingual language development theory has continued for decades, with few solid answers resulting from these efforts. The current study is a first step in the process of understanding what, if any, effects multilingual upbringings have on the conversational abilities of children with autism. A multielement (alternating treatments) design was implemented to compare whether children's expressive language output substantially differed when the interventionist spoke either English or Spanish during conversation training based on the methodology of Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT). Naturalistic interventions, such as PRT, are evidence-based in their effectiveness for improving a wide range of behavioral and socio-communicative skills for children with ASD and were utilized in the current study to maintain a natural home setting for the children. The data suggest no difference across a variety of dependent variable for expressive language for the child participants. Further directions for research and implications of these findings are discussed.",,,
1089,Personality and retributive vs. utilitarian criminal judgment: Anxiety and extraversion influence punishment style,"The criminal justice system relies heavily on normative judgments by judges and juries. However, people do not make judgments based solely on the merits of a case. Instead, individuals tend to employ punishment styles that tend toward being either more retributive (i.e., a vengeful punishment style) or more utilitarian (i.e., a punishment style based on considering possible future consequences). Previous research suggests that individuals with more psychopathic traits - including low anxiety, impulsive or antisocial behavior, and emotional detachment - are deficient in retributive punishment and tend to punish offenders using a utilitarian method. Because a lack of anxiety has been noted as predominant in major accounts of psychopathy, this study was undertaken in part to investigate whether anxiety was the driving factor behind previous findings of difference in punishment style. Since individuals high in psychopathic traits were more utilitarian in their punishments, it was hypothesized that high levels of anxiety would correlate with more retributive punishment decisions. Participants' anxiety was measured using the Neuroticism scale of the 48-item version of the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI-48). All participants also read two vignettes involving a crime committed by a male offender. After reading each vignette, participants completed a questionnaire to indicate the appropriate punishment for the respective offender. The questionnaire consisted of questions regarding the appropriate punishment for the offender as well as manipulation checks and filler questions. Participant's scores on the EPI-48 Neuroticism subscale were then correlated to their individual punishment ratings. A total rating was also calculated for each participant for both vignettes and correlated to participant's scores on the EPI-48 Neuroticism subscale. There were no observed correlations between participants' EPI-48 Neuroticism sub-scale scores and punishment responses for the offenders in either condition, except for one. Participants' scores on the EPI-48 Neuroticism sub-scale positively correlated with how much time in a mental institution they assigned to the offender in the low-intent, high-recidivism-risk condition. Extraversion, another sub-scale of the EPI-48, also weakly negatively correlated with one of the punishment scores in the low-intent, high-recidivism-risk condition style. Contrary to expectation, anxiety as measured by EPI-48 Neuroticism did not appear to underlie punishment style in this study. Instead, a more complex mechanism is likely at work.",,,
1090,Cultivating opportunity in the soil of crisis: Urban agriculture and local food in Michigan and California,"The local food movement offers the simple premise that changing the way we eat can change the world. As the global adoption of neoliberal practices has encouraged the ""privatization of survival,"" where states deregulate, sell, and commodify social services once provided for free or at low cost, people without monetary means to access them have gone into debt or gone without. This reduction in public services, rising unemployment rates, soaring fuel and food costs, and a ""race to the bottom in food"" production that makes food less nutritious and less safe, have made more people unable to provide for basic needs and consume healthy food. Additionally, as neoliberal policies have triggered extreme economic inequality, acute difficulties meeting basic needs, and the erosion of political representation, people have responded by rejecting globalization outright or attempting to guide it down a more sustainable path. To better understand the nature of such responses to globalization, where the local food movement fits in, and how urban agriculture efforts in Detroit, Flint, and Ypsilanti are unique, this project documents how the local food movement seeks to relocalize the economy and adopt more sustainable consumption practices to counter the economic inequality, resource scarcity, and social fragmentation exacerbated by neoliberal policies and practices. This project is an ethnographic study of the local food movement in southeastern Michigan and California conducted through urban agriculture experiments and participant observation of farmers markets, urban farms, farmers' cooperatives, community and school gardens, restaurants, non-profits, and local food distribution networks. It also included an online survey investigating motives to support and participate in the local food movement, a comparison between the physical environment, food system, and social environment in Michigan and California, and informal interviews with growers, producers, eaters, chefs, and business owners. It found that although California agriculture is dominant in crop diversity, growing season, and production volume, Michigan has advantages in water and land access, food safety legislation, and zoning ordinances that enable urban agriculture initiatives to be more successful.",,,
1091,"Stratigraphy, structure, and geochronology of the Abanico Formation in the Principal Cordillera, central Chile: Evidence of protracted volcanism and implications for Andean tectonics","Long-term (>10 Myr) spatial and temporal patterns of magmatism and upper crustal deformation along Andean-type subduction margins are poorly understood. New geologic mapping, petrographic observations, structural analysis, and 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb zircon geochronology of the Abanico Formation in the Rio Tinguiririca region shed light on the long-term evolution of central Chile's subduction margin, and permit testing of opposing tectonic models for the southern Andes. Results indicate the Abanico Formation is ~3.6+ km thick in the Tinguiririca region and consists dominantly of volcanic and volcaniclastic strata, with subordinate epiclastic intervals; 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb age data acquired for the Abanico Formation span the Late Cretaceous through Miocene (~74-11 Ma). Stratigraphic relationships within the Abanico Formation and the tight clustering of age data indicate that pulsed volcanism in the region was punctuated by long periods of emergence, erosion, and aggradation of volcaniclastic and epiclastic sediments, presumably in an intra-arc setting. A strong, generally N-S trending transpressional overprint deforms the Abanico and older map units. Radiometric dating of growth strata and an age correlated sill crosscutting fault propagation structures indicate that shortening was underway prior to the late Eocene and continued through the late Miocene, coeval with continued magmatism. Collectively, results from this study significantly revise previously proposed chronologies of magmatism, sedimentation, and deformation within this sector of the Andes. 40Ar/39Ar geochronology was critical to dating mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks examined in this study. The primary phases used in 40Ar/39Ar dating are highly susceptible to low grade and/or hydrothermal alteration that can frequently be difficult to identify in hand sample or thin section, however. Electron microscopy was employed in this study to assess the extent of alteration and the potassium distribution within six volcanic samples whose corresponding 40Ar/39Ar spectra range from slightly to strongly disturbed. Results indicate that both alteration and potassium distribution within a sample exert a first order control on the Ar isotope systematics, and that electron microscopy is highly effective for screening samples for 40Ar/39Ar geochronology.",,,
1092,Nonpolar Gallium Nitride-based VCSELs,"GaN vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) are of increasing interest as sources of high-quality coherent light in the visible spectrum, particularly in blue wavelengths. These devices so far suffer from many problems, including low output power, low yield, and high costs. Nonpolar GaN offers many advantages for VCSELs. Anisotropic electric fields in the plane of the emitting quantum wells results in higher gain and crystallographically-oriented polarization of emitted light. This should result in the unique property of polarization locking, whereby the polarization direction of each device is identical, and determined by the crystal structure of the material in the device. Prior demonstrations of GaN VCSELs have relied on epitaxially-grown n-DBR mirrors, or mechanical polishing to remove the substrate to allow for deposition of dielectric DBR mirrors. Epitaxially-grown DBRs give epitaxial control of cavity length, but are very difficult and costly to grow. Mechanical polishing and deposition of dielectric DBRs simplifies fabrication, but gives no control of cavity length. This thesis reports on a novel fabrication method using photoelectrochemical (PEC) etching that gives epitaxial control of cavity length, while still allowing for the use of dielectric DBR mirrors. Using this novel fabrication method, the first nonpolar GaN-based VCSELs are demonstrated. These devices exhibit polarization locking, where each device is highly polarized parallel to the crystallographic a-direction of the wurtzite crystal structure. Electrically-injected lasing under pulsed operation at room temperature is reported, with an output power of approximately 20 uW at a wavelength of 411.9 nm.",,,
1093,"Elections, protests, and the provision of public goods","This dissertation analyzes how political behavior influences the allocation of public goods. The first chapter studies the effect of conventional political participation (electoral competitiveness) on natural disaster preparedness spending in the United States. The second chapter analyzes the effect of non-conventional political participation (protest) on water policy outcomes using Mexico's data. I discuss that contentious actions such as protest (from sit-ins to sabotage) are pervasive in many democratic countries, yet their effect on public policy has been overlooked, leaving a gap in our knowledge of how the public may influence the policy-making process. From the social welfare perspective, the crucial question is the following: What is the overall effect of protest (performed by a few) on policy outcomes (affecting the utility of a wider group)? I show theoretically that even a social planner with complete information will allocate water sub-optimally and, empirically --using an estimation of propensity to protest in Mexico-- I show that protest affects the provision of water water at the municipality level. The last two chapters analyze why citizens engage in protest, contributing to a better understanding of a behavior that has consequential effects for social welfare. I address why citizens engage in protest as an alternative or as a complement to electoral participation. The results show that the chosen actions depend of the relative costs and benefits of each strategy. The fourth chapter explores why some citizens engage in illegal protest specifically. The empirical model shows that affiliation to some organizations increases the probability of that type of protest. As a whole, the paper expands the knowledge of political participation in Mexico and addresses the implications for policymaking in democratic countries.",,,
1095,We Build Up This Community Together: Examining Khmer Heritage Language Learning in the Context of Asset-based Community Development,"For many immigrant groups living in host countries, the fostering and maintenance of their heritage language and culture or languaculture (Agar, 1994, 2006) are placed as the sole responsibility of the immigrants and their families (Kloss, 1998). As such, the establishment of the majority of the heritage language schools in the United States has always been a private endeavor carried out by the ethnic communities themselves (Fishman & Nahirny, 1966; Zhou & Li, 2003). Previous studies have well documented independently run community heritage language schools across the United States (Bradunas, 1988; Chik, 2010; Long, Needham, 1996; Shibata, 2000). This dissertation contributes to this body of work by examining an alternative framework used to establish a heritage language school, a multi-institutional partnership in which different groups of people from the heritage community as well as the geopolitical community joined forces in providing ethnic language program for their community members. Grounded in an ethnographic perspective and using constructs of discourse analysis and intertextuality, this two-year ethnographic case study focuses on a community-based Khmer heritage language program in California. In particular, by focusing on the individuals who spearheaded the language program, this study explores their role in constructing a language learning environment for their community members. Questions guiding this study include: What factors contribute to the construction of this learning environment? How do their inter-agencies influence the creation of this language program? How do the founders' past histories shape and influence the current language program? What factors contribute to the construction of this learning environment? How do their inter-agencies influence the creation of this language program? How do the founders' past histories shape and influence the current language program? The study led to the identification of a multi-institutional partnership that was facilitated by the individuals' prior experience with similar events, their social networks and relationships that were built through their sustaining residence in the community as well as their inter-agency relationships that they brought to the process to ensure the actualization of the collaboration. The data also showed how the partnership fostered home-community connections among stakeholders involved, how multi-layer resources are needed in sustaining the program as well as how the partners spoke about the power and efficacy of community force. The findings, therefore, form the basis for a multi-agency partnership framework that reflects the nature of the weekend-language program and its benefits that otherwise would not exist if the program was independently run.",,,
1096,Effects of stimulus presentation frequency on rule based human category learning of 6 dimensional binary valued stimuli,"An increase in accuracy prior to rule acquisition in a rule based category learning task of six dimensional binary valued stimuli has been consistently observed. To probe whether this increase was a consequence of procedural learning mediated by the striatum, stimuli were divided in to three frequency groups such that subjects responded to some stimuli much more frequently than others. The lack of significant differences in accuracy increases prior to rule acquisition for stimuli with higher numbers of presentations suggests that the relative frequency of stimulus presentation is not relevant to this effect and therefore it is unlikely that this increase is a consequence of procedural learning mediated through the basal ganglia. Subjects demonstrate the same accuracy increase regardless of the number of repetitions of an individual stimulus, and a clear explanation for this effect has yet to come to light. Further possibilities will be explored through future experiments.",,,
1097,Estrategias filosoficas y discursivas de Estela Portillo Trambley,"The critical world has primarily centered on Estela Portillo Trambley's feminist stance. Up to a point, this study can be inserted in this analytical vein. I have studied how Portillo Trambley confronts the patriarchal discourse and her solutions to overcome its grip. But contrary to previous studies, however, I am proposing that her feminist vantage point is a portal for a more integral objective. Although her literary pieces addressed the Chicana's clamor for justice, they also revealed that her tribulations were of global concern. As a starting point, she advocates for Chicano women. But she perceived the feminism of her time as a circumscribed effort that focused on defending the victim and repudiated the victimizer, and at the end, incapable of reconciling them. Portillo Trambley's goal is that the changes produced by feminism benefit all of humanity. She comprehends that progress is vital to her ethnic group, but at the same time, she takes into account her community's relationship to the rest of the world. Simultaneously, we argue that Portillo Trambley positions her work against Catholicism and the Chicano Movement, in particular ""cultural nationalism"". The spirituality manifested in her literary pieces is based on pre-Columbian religious beliefs, primarily the Toltec, Aztec and Mayan cultures. This ideology is enlaced with Carl Gustav Jung's metaphysical concept, the ""Collective Unconscious"", to deconstruct the hegemonic apparatus that dominates the Chicana's life: the Catholic dogma and the macho practices in her culture. Lastly, we propose that her work, rooted in Chicano culture, can be interpreted as cultural and intellectual currents that have an idealist aspiration, namely a brotherhood of humanity. Like a multi-colorful quilt made of diverse treads, Portillo Trambley interweaves various philosophies and discourses in her literary works, among them indigenism, feminism and Hinduism, to create and consolidate her world view. As a result, her literary corpus is a humanist discourse or transcendental chicanismo that transgresses and transforms the physical and imaginary borders that divide humanity, and instead celebrates a mythical union among human beings as the ""cosmic race"".",,,
1098,Essays in Applied Microeconomics,"This dissertation consists of three papers in the field of applied microeconomics. The first paper investigates whether or not physical tests used in the hiring process negatively impact the number of women hired. Previous studies have reported that physical tests administered to new recruits adversely impact women. Although interesting, these papers have not applied econometric analysis to determine the effects of physical exams on the composition of local police departments. Instead they use case studies and test of means to derive their conclusions. The purpose of this paper is to use econometric analysis to determine the discriminatory effects of physical exams. Our main contribution is to use a fixed effects approach to control for unobserved discrimination. Our results indicate that once discrimination has been controlled for physical exams do not affect the proportion of women employed in police departments. The second paper investigates the economic variables and data used to model notices of default in California during the financial crisis of 2008--2009. Forecast models are notoriously complicated and require sophisticated software to run. Few businesses, particularly small enterprises, have the necessary resources to engage in large-scale model building. Furthermore, data can be difficult and expensive to obtain and usually requires significant analysis. The paper will focus on methodology to give the model a general appeal. The model has been kept simple and easy to use in the hope that others will use it. The final paper investigates the impact of foreign aid on tuberculosis outcomes. Each year foreign aid organizations give billions of dollars to developing countries with the goal of improving their economic and social welfare. Most research suggests that foreign aid is ineffective. However, we believe that most researchers do not compare aid to the right outcome variable. To correct this problem we compare aid designated specifically for tuberculosis control to specific tuberculosis outcomes. Our results suggest that tuberculosis aid reduces the incidence of tuberculosis.",,,
1099,Characterizing spatial and temporal patterns of cloud cover and fog inundation for the Northern Channel islands of California,"The presence of low-lying stratocumulus clouds and fog has been known to modify biophysical and ecological properties in a variety of ecosystems in different climates. This is especially true for California's Channel Islands, where forests are frequently shaded by low-lying clouds or immersed in fog during warm and dry summer months. Previous studies suggest that clouds strongly modulate forest distributions as well as carbon and water budgets in these semi-arid environments by reducing solar insolation and raising relative humidity and thus reducing evapotranspiration, while also potentially supplying water directly to the landscape from fog-drip. While summertime fog and stratus cover in California's Channel Islands can ameliorate summer drought stress and enhance soil water budgets, they often have different spatial and temporal patterns. These differing patterns and the resulting shifts in relative ecological importance of fog and stratus are understudied. The overall objective of this study is to map spatial and temporal distributions of daytime cloud cover frequency for the California Channel Islands, and to predict probabilities of surface cloud (fog) contact and immersion for these islands. The results of this research are significant for water balance modeling, help explain vegetation patterns on the islands, and better identify locations where native vegetation restoration efforts are likely to be most successful.",,,
1100,Africa's wars of liberation: Impact and economic recovery,"Do the ways in which Africa became independent from colonial rules have persistent adverse effects on subsequent economic development? To examine this question, I construct a panel data set with two categories of countries: one that became independent through the Wars of Liberation against its former European colonizers, and the other which did so through peaceful agreement. I use the Synthetic Control Method to jointly estimate the income gap between the two groups before and after independence. Relative to their counterparts without conflict, I find that annual per capita income for the conflict group that gained independence through wars (Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe) would have been 7% higher, had it achieved peaceful independence. This income gap increased to 10% as these countries transitioned closer towards independence. The gap remained constant at 10% for about a decade after independence. However, the gap narrowed over time, then dissipated after 15 years as both groups' per capita incomes converge to a similar growth pattern. That is, the results suggest that independence via conflict has no persistent effect on today's economic performance.",,,
1101,Beyond Words: The Sensuous Turn in Jacobean England,"Beyond Words begins by rethinking the relationship between the sciences and the humanities in the early seventeenth century. While recent scholarship has increasingly acknowledged an overlap between the two fields, we largely continue to conceive of them as manifesting two discreet cultures with distinct allegiances and forms of knowledge making. Reading Francis Bacon's treatises on natural philosophy alongside the poetry and drama of Fulke Greville, Ben Jonson, John Donne, and George Herbert, Beyond Words examines how all these writers developed sensuous, often visual and emblematic, representational strategies to surmount what Bacon identified as the epistemological limitations of language. This project is largely a generational study, focusing on a group of writers who, with the exception of Donne, were loosely affiliated with Bacon's project as advocates and translators. Nonetheless, it also seeks to position these writers within a larger intellectual history. Not only do their efforts anticipate a mid seventeenth-century shift towards image-based learning in English pedagogy, but they also inform the emphasis late seventeenth-century philosophers (Locke and Hobbes, for instance) would place on the epistemological centrality of vision.",,,
1102,Crowded Margins: Modernist Performances of the Agile Crowd and Multitude,"This dissertation studies the representations of crowds, their marginalized figures and paradigmatic types in Irish and British fiction from the fin de siecle to the mid-twentieth century. ""Crowded Margins"" anatomizes twentieth-century fictional crowds as they act in counterpoint with established imagined communities such as nation, shared history and language, and compares literary crowds to models operating in the realms of political, psychoanalytic and social theory. The project demonstrates the centrality of collective experience to modernist style, analyzes how modernist fictional representations of crowds intervene in theorizations of agency, identity and operation, and draws new connections between aesthetic productions and political change during the period. It shows that a considerable number of the period's literary texts anticipate postmodernity's anti-totalizing identities, and current academic work on the political multitude, such as what has been produced about the multitude's mobility or its discursive indeterminability, in empire studies and theories of biopolitics. ""Crowded Margins"" proposes a fresh account of collective autonomy and efficacy by positing that in these literary texts the crowd recognizes itself as a diasporic and agile network which supervises its own world-making and negotiates its cultural exchanges.",,,
1104,Camera coordination for intruder detection in 1D environments,"This work proposes surveillance trajectories for a network of active (pan-tilt-zoom) cameras to detect intruders. We consider smart intruders, which appear at arbitrary times and locations, are aware of the cameras configuration, and move to avoid detection for as long as possible. As performance criteria we consider the worst-case detection time and the average detection time. We focus on the case of a chain of cameras, and we obtain the following results. First, we characterize a lower bound on the worst-case and on the average detection time of smart intruders. Second, we propose a team trajectory for the cameras, namely Equal-waiting trajectory, with minimum worst-case detection time and with guarantees on the average detection time. Third, we design a distributed algorithm to coordinate the cameras along an Equal-waiting trajectory. Fourth, we design a distributed algorithm for cameras reconfiguration in the case of failure or network change. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithms via simulations and experiments on a camera network testbed.",,,
1105,Two-Terminal Bonded III-V Multijunction Photovoltaic Devices,"Multi-junction solar cells combine multiple junctions made of materials with different band gaps that are carefully selected to optimize power conversion efficiency. Current state of the art triple-junction devices achieve power conversion efficiencies over 40% under concentrated sunlight. As the industry drives for higher efficiency with additional junctions, lattice matching becomes a limiting factor due to specific band gap requirements for each junction. This work describes a bonding method that was developed to enable the creation of multi-junction cells using sub-cells, which cannot be grown monolithically due to lattice constant constrains. A four-junction (4J) configuration is proposed in which an upper GaInP/GaAs 2J tandem cell is bonded to a lower GaInAsP/GaInAs 2J tandem cell. In this 4J configuration, the upper tandem is grown inverted and lattice-matched to a GaAs substrate and the lower tandem is grown upright and lattice-matched to an InP substrate. A five-junction (5J) configuration with a GaN-based wide-band gap material integrated with the four-junction structure described above is also possible, and the expected efficiency for this 5J device exceeds 50%. A wide variety of other device configurations using similar bonding methods can be explored. Devices have been fabricated using Au-Au bonded interconnects and either SiO2 or GaInP2 as a transparent filler for the remainder of the interfacial volume. Several different sub-cell configurations have been successfully fabricated, using both SiO2 and GaInP 2 fillers. So far, the most complex configuration fabricated is a GaInP/GaAs two-junction cell bonded to an InGaAs cell using a GaInP2 optical coupling layer. This configuration results in Voc= 2.70 V, J sc = 12.66 mA/cm2, FF = 83.0%, and efficiency =28.39% under the 1-sun ASTM G173 direct spectrum. This dissertation will discuss the design of the bonded III-V multi-junction device, such as band gap selection, metal topology design and optical design. The fabrication development process is also discussed and both device characterization and results will be presented.",,,
1106,Global Shakespeare at the Globe: Challenging the Tourist-Spectator,"Between 1997 and 2001, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre invited troupes from South Africa, Cuba, India, Brazil, and Japan to present translations of Shakespearean plays on its London stage. Known as the ""Globe to Globe"" series, this set of productions received ambivalent and sometimes condescending reviews from British critics who did not understand the translation languages or performance conventions. Taking these reviews to encapsulate the productions' reception, scholars have agreed that the series reinforced hegemonic hierarchies between spectators and performers. They argue that the displacement to London rendered the performances' original meanings unintelligible; further, that this dislocation stimulated national superiority in British spectators who measured the performances against their expectations of Shakespeare and their tourist-like desires to witness an exotic Other. However, this perspective obscures both the agency of the performers as participants in the encounter and the diversity of audience response, presenting a fatalistic view of touring performance. I argue that that in a performance across language and culture, failures in understanding do not indicate the failure of the event; rather, they can provoke spectators to suspend their preconceptions and negotiate new relationships. Reading professional reviews against the grain and placing them in conversation with video records and other documentation of the mass audiences' reactions, I suggest that the productions subverted the tourist gaze by resisting easy comprehension. As translation and 'foreign' performance conventions reshaped famous texts, the productions undermined audiences' expectations of both Shakespeare and the culture onstage. Confronted with the limits of their knowledge, spectators improvised new strategies of viewing, learning habits of listening and questioning that challenged cultural hierarchies. These events further undermined dominant power dynamics by attracting audiences from London's diasporic communities and privileging their knowledge and reactions over those of the normative British spectator. This trend intensified in 2012, when the Globe to Globe concept was revived as a massive festival for audiences containing many translation-language speakers. Through spectator surveys, I show that the 2012 performances contributed to a shift in the norms of mainstream London theatre, challenging the centrality of English as the standard for both Shakespearean performance and the source of audience privilege.",,,
1107,Identifying Genetic Determinants of Distinct Cell Types in the Mouse Retina,"The brain is a complex structure comprised of hundreds of functionally distinct types of neurons: each type having different population sizes, positioning within the tissue, morphology, and connections to other cell types. This diversity underlies the ability of the brain to perform the complex functions with which it is continually tasked. The research described in this dissertation seeks to identify the genes involved in the establishment of these different features for specific neuronal populations. The genetic determinants of different traits were investigated for three retinal cell types, including bipolar cell population size, amacrine cell positioning, and retinal ganglion cell differentiation. Novel functions in neuronal development were identified for both Gpr56 and Sox2 in the establishment of specific bipolar and amacrine cell populations, respectively. The differentiation of retinal ganglion cells and the role of alternative splicing as a potential mechanism for increased neuronal diversity were investigate; revealing possible distinct functions of two isoforms of Isl1 in retinal development. The work described herein has furthered understanding of the developmental events and molecular mechanisms required for the formation of mature neuronal tissue.",,,
1108,Modular decomposition of a metabolic network,"The modular decomposition of a metabolic network is discussed. We show that a metabolic network can be decomposed into isolated functional modules using the spectral method with knowledge of the chemical reactions alone. Moreover, it can be seen that the modular decomposition can be improved by taking the reaction dynamics into account. We present our work using the metabolic network obtained from a cell simulation model called Whole-Cell Model.",,,
1109,Advancements in iii-nitride materials for thermoelectric applications,"Thermoelectrics have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their ability to directly convert heat into electricity using a completely solid state device. Additionally, thermoelectrics are capable of operating as a heat pump and are promising for small scale cooling applications. The lack of moving parts in solid state devices imparts the important advantages of being highly scalable, noise and vibration free, and extremely reliable. These advantages make thermoelectrics desirable for a diverse range of applications such as distributed waste heat recovery and rapid small-scale cooling. The most commonly cited metric for thermoelectric materials is the thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, which is directly related to device efficiencies. Traditional commercial thermoelectric materials have maximum ZT values near one. In order to break through this threshold and make significant improvements in thermoelectric device efficiencies new material systems and novel thermoelectric strategies must be pursued. III-Nitride materials (InN, AlN, and GaN) and their alloys have seen recent commercial success in visible spectrum optoelectronic devices as well as in power electronics. These materials also exhibit very good temperature stability, wide band gaps, and are non-toxic, which makes them highly desirable for thermoelectric electricity generation applications. The current work investigates the high temperature thermoelectric properties of ternary III-Nitride alloys (InGaN, InAlN, and AlGaN) both experimentally and theoretically. InGaN shows the highest ZT values experimentally reaching 0.34 at 875 K and theoretically reaching 0.85 at 1200 K. This high ZT makes InGaN competitive with commercial materials for high temperature electricity generation applications. Further improvements in ZT are demonstrated in metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) grown GaN/AlN/AlGaN superlattices. These structures demonstrate a novel strategy for breaking through traditional limitations on thermoelectric efficiencies by using the exceptionally strong internal polarization fields present in III-Nitride materials to concentrate electrons into high mobility channels, thus improving electrical conductivity and ZT past conventional bulk limits. Using this strategy GaN/AlN/AlGaN superlattices demonstrate vastly improved electron mobilities and a four fold increase in room temperature ZT.",,,
1110,"Transpacific utopias: the making of new Chinese American immigrant literature, 1945-2010","This dissertation looks at theories of hope and utopia in the works of transnational and first-generation Chinese American authors from 1945-2010. By beginning after the Maoist Revolution and the Second Sino-Japanese War, this project follows the development of the transnational and first-generation new immigrant through the works of Lin Yutang, Li-Young Lee, Nieh Hualing, Ha Jin, and Wang Ping. In addressing these authors the dissertation considers how they have sought to leave behind the social and political conditions prevailing in China then, to journey across the Pacific and thence to imagine and author worlds different from their original sources. How do writers fictionalize migration and land-orientation to signal the emergence of a new hope, one less nation-based and instead invested in a global identity? These texts engage histories of Chinese Communism, American capitalism, and American democracy, and their re-imagined representations of these issues arguably have helped shape the new transnational immigrant sensibility in U.S. literary studies. The dissertation examines the resilience of hope as a re-generative affect in the social imaginary drawn in these texts when dreams of financial success, political freedom and upward social mobility fall short. As failure is dramatized and thematized, hope as a motivating idea becomes more and more situated in the immaterial world, and this alternative productively complicates the theories of utopia and hope that I review in this thesis. Studying immigrant attempts to achieve a utopia ""of one's own"" puts pressure on the US as a presumed utopian site and re-frames the conventional image of the country as a promised land. While the dissertation focuses on a select Chinese American canon as a signifier for a national shift in global identity, this focus, I argue, enables a larger investigation into and sustained discourse on the representations of hope in contemporary and ethnic U.S. writing.",,,
1111,Quadratic Convexity and Sums of Squares,"The length of a sum of squares sigma in a ring R is the smallest natural number k such that sigma can be realized as a sum of k squares in R. For a set S contained in R, the pythagoras number of S, denoted by PS , is the maximum value of length over all sigma belonging to S. This dissertation is motivated by the following simple question: if R is the ring of polynomials in n indeterminates over the reals and S is the span of forms of degree 2 d, then what is PS ? By parametrizing the set of sums of k squares, we obtain a new formulation of the problem: when is the image of a quadratic map convex? We prove several results on the structure of quadratic images and of the set of quadratic maps in general. In particular, we give conditions under which convexity of a quadratic image is equivalent to convexity of its compact intersection with an affine hyperplane. We prove a relationship between convexity of a quadratic image and rank of the derivative of a quadratic map. We then show how an arbitrary quadratic map can be modified so that its image is preserved and the result on the derivative may be exploited. A necessary condition for quadratic convexity is thus derived.",,,
1112,"Correlating optical and physical properties of few-atom, fluorescent silver clusters","Here we investigate the correlations between optical and physical properties of few-atom fluorescent silver nanoclusters, stabilized by DNA. Specifically, we examine how fluorescence colors depend on the stabilizing strand's base and sugar type, on the number of silver atoms in the cluster and on cluster shape. We study the fluorescence properties of silver clusters stabilized by DNA and RNA homopolymers under a wide range of synthesis conditions and discover that both DNA and RNA display the same striking base dependence, establishing a C,G vs A, T(U) dichotomy. Despite demonstrating the same general base dependence, DNA and RNA homopolymer analogs display unique optical properties, suggesting that the composition of the backbone additionally plays a role in controlling cluster properties. To examine the physical properties of the cluster, we develop a high performance liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) method with in-line absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy, which directly correlates optical properties with the mass and charge of the complex. We find that emission colors trend to longer wavelengths as the number of silver atoms (NAg) in the cluster increases. We additionally find a direct correlation between cluster charge and NAg, which together with absorbance spectral features and polarization dependencies reveals that DNA-stabilized silver clusters have rod-like structures, whose emission colors are dictated by the length of their free electron systems. Our findings have motivated two new applications for oligonucleotide-stabilized silver clusters. We first exploit the sequence dependence of Ag:RNAs and their bias against formation on dsRNA to track the assembly of an RNA nanostructure. This new method is highly advantageous over current laborious methods to verify the complete assembly of RNA (or DNA) structures. Lastly, we broach the long-term goal of incorporating fluorescent silver nanoclusters into DNA assemblies with the aim of constructing highly ordered optical arrays on the nanoscale. We demonstrate a proof-of-principle for such a structure by developing a method to bring two distinct silver clusters together, producing a dual-color assembly. We verify the nanoscale proximity of the two clusters by observing inter-cluster FRET, an optical readout occurring only when a donor and acceptor fluorophore are within nm proximity.",,,
1113,Designing reliable modern memory systems,"Memory errors are an important threat to computer system reliability. In production sites running large-scale systems, memory errors are one of the most common hardware problems that lead to machine crashes and are ranked near the top of component replacements. Memory errors are projected to increase in future systems not only because of the continuous increase in capacity, but also because of the integration of emerging non-volatile memory technologies within the memory hierarchy. As conventional memories scaling is in jeopardy, researchers are investigating the use of emerging technologies such as Phase-Change Memory (PCM) and Memristors as potential future scalable replacement for their traditional counter-parts. These memories promise several common advantages such as scaling, high density, and non-volatility. In addition, each technology has its unique properties such as analog-computations for Memristors and temperature-friendliness for PCM. However, in order for these memories to be used as a successful replacement for conventional memories, we need to address their major challenges such as limited endurance, high defect rates and high write energy. In our work, we explore potential directions to improving the reliability of DRAM as well as new memory technologies. Our work is guided by current trends in designing reliability features and major milestones in emerging memory technologies. We build a modeling tool to guide the design of future reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) features. Furthermore, we present two case- studies that exploit materials properties and unique characteristics to address their reliability concerns and/or improve their energy efficiency. The first case-study explores using Memristors to implement a highly accurate neural branch predictor. This application relies on Memristors' high density and ability to do analog computations efficiently to implement a highly accurate predictor that lasts 5-years under a high frequency of updates and in presence of high defect rate. The second case-study explores using Phase-change memories to build heterogeneous 3D-memory stack. We exploit the temperature variation across layers within the 3D-stack to enable building heterogeneous stack. This improves the write energy by up to 3.5X and extends the lifetime of the memory system by 30%.",,,
1114,Optimization in Stochastic Hybrid and Switching Systems,"This work focuses on optimal quadratic control of a class of hybrid and switching systems. In the first part of this dissertation, we explore the effect of stochastically varying environments on the gene regulation problem. We use a mathematical model that combines stochastic changes in the environments with linear ordinary differential equations describing the concentration of gene products. Motivated by this problem, we study the quadratic control of a class of stochastic hybrid systems for which the lengths of time that the system stays in each mode are independent random variables with given probability distribution functions. We derive a sufficient condition for finding the optimal feedback policy that minimizes a discounted infinite horizon cost. We show that the optimal cost is the solution to a set of differential equations with unknown boundary conditions. Furthermore, we provide a recursive algorithm for computing the optimal cost and the optimal feedback policy. When the time intervals between jumps are exponential random variables, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the optimal controller in terms of a system of linear matrix inequalities. In the second part of this monograph, we present the problem of optimal controller initialization in multivariable switching systems. We show that by finding optimal values for the initial controller state, one can achieve significantly better transient performance when switching between linear controllers for a not necessarily asymptotically stable MIMO linear process. The initialization is obtained by performing the minimization of a quadratic cost function. By suitable choice of realizations for the controllers, we guarantee input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system when the average number of switches per unit of time is smaller than a specific value. If this is not the case, we show that input-to-state stability can be achieved under a mild constraint in the optimization.",,,
1116,Development of novel technologies for discovery of high performance affinity reagents,"Comprehensive understanding of the proteome holds the promise for revolutionizing medicine. In order to functionally explore, understand and exploit the proteome, the availability of a comprehensive, well-characterized collection of renewable affinity reagents that specifically bind to the target proteins is an absolute necessity. Unfortunately, monoclonal antibodies cover only a small fraction of the proteome, despite decades of development. Thus, a quantum leap in affinity reagents discovery is urgently needed. Toward meeting this demand, we present two novel technologies that can generate high quality synthetic affinity reagents (nucleic acid aptamers and polypeptides) in a rapid and economic manner, towards accelerated exploration of the human proteome. First, we will present a high-throughput aptamer screening technology that reproducibly yields high quality aptamers. Our method (termed Particle Display) transforms libraries of solution-phase aptamers into ""aptamer particles"", each displaying many copies of a single sequence on its surface. We then use fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to individually measure the relative affinities and specificities of 10 8 aptamer particles and sort them in a high-throughput manner. We used particle display to obtain high-affinity DNA aptamers for various protein targets, including proteins for which previous aptamer selection attempts have repeatedly failed. Second, we will expand the particle display technology to discover aptamer pairs that bind to distinct binding sites of the same protein target. We identified multiple pairs that bind to PAI-1 at different binding sites. Preliminary results showed that these aptamer pairs can be directly deployed in sandwich format assays and can reach pM range limit of detection in the presence of diluted serum. Finally, we present the microfluidic phage selection (MiPS) system, which is the first microfluidic system for selecting phage-displayed peptides against surface markers from live mammalian cells. Compared to conventional biopanning methods, microfluidic selection enables more efficient discovery of peptides with higher affinity and specificity by providing controllable and reproducible means for applying stringent selection conditions against minimal amounts of target cells without loss. Using our microfluidic system, we isolate peptide sequences with superior binding affinity and specificity relative to the well-known NRP-1-binding RPARPAR peptide.",,,
1117,Efficient guidance of underpowered vehicles in time-varying flow fields,"In this thesis we study high-level trajectory planning for underpowered vehicles in spatially complex, 2D, time-varying flow fields. In particular, we consider a minimum time problem and a minimum energy problem. These problems are difficult because locally optimal trajectories abound and currents stronger than the vehicle can push it far off course. Nevertheless, globally optimal trajectories can be obtained by numerical solution of a dynamic Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation (PDE) for the time-varying optimal cost-to-go function---the gradient of which yields an optimal feedback control law. Locally optimal trajectories are associated with shocks---discontinuities in the gradient of the cost-to-go. Strong currents are associated with discontinuities in the cost-to-go itself. Existing work is primarily concerned with the proper capturing of shocks, and is mostly limited to weak, time-invariant flows. But strong, time-varying flows play a large role in the real-life problem. Thus the characterization of solutions for realistic flows has involved significant experimentation with novel solution approaches. A key theme has been the complementary nature of Eulerian or semi-Lagrangian finite difference methods and Lagrangian particle methods. The former methods are associated with implicit front tracking methods such as Level Set Methods and Fast Marching, and rely on shock-capturing (e.g. Godunov) schemes. The latter methods are associated with explicit front tracking methods but compute particle trajectories in a higher-dimensional state-``costate'' space using the well-known Euler Lagrange ordinary differential equations; these are variants of the so-called ``extremal field'' method. Other themes include the use of adaptive grids and the dichotomy between backward-in-time methods for closed-loop optimal trajectories and forward-in-time methods for open-loop optimal trajectories. In all cases, the resulting trajectories are globally optimal. First, we present a forward-in-time Lagrangian method that exploits a special property of minimum time control to obtain open-loop optimal trajectories, without actually solving the dynamic HJB equation. The algorithm proved highly dependent on adaptive remeshing of the Lagrangian marker particles along the tracked front and a rather complicated trimming procedure for local optima. Examples include a numerically defined strong, time-varying flow field from a model of the Adriatic Sea. Second, we present a backward-in-time semi-Lagrangian method on an adaptive triangle grid for the fixed final time minimum energy problem. The algorithm effectively transforms the optimal control problem into a point wise optimization problem, which we choose to solve exactly by keeping the discretizations first order in space and time. In the end, there turn out to be fundamental limitations on the performance of this algorithm, due to the computational complexity of the point wise optimization problem. Third, we briefly present an idea for a coordinate transformation based on the Jacobian of the so-called flow map---the state at the fixed final time if one were to turn the control off. This suggests a greedy heuristic control scheme, which we compare to the minimum energy control. Finally, we conclude with a 1D proof of concept for a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian minimum energy algorithm that combines the best of the Lagrangian minimum time algorithm and the semi-Lagrangian minimum energy algorithms.",,,
1118,An Exploration of Teacher Support for Performance Pay in Southern California,"To meet the continued demand for educational reform and improved student achievement policy makers have been urging performance related pay in public education. The problem of this study was that research on teacher performance rewards in education is mixed, and throughout U.S. education history teacher rewards programs tend to be abandoned for a variety of failures. The purpose of this study was to explore teachers' perceptions of performance related pay (PRP), prior to local/state implementation of such plans, including their agreement/disagreement about various aspects and effects of these plans. Additionally, this research sought to determine if there were relationships among perceptions of PRP, teacher experience, and job satisfaction. Finally, the study sought to explore teachers' perceptions about acceptable alternatives to PRP plans. A random sample of teachers within four suburban Southern California K-12 schools was surveyed about their attitudes regarding PRP when performance is measured with two distinct models: a) teacher performance measured through student standardized test outcomes, and b) teacher performance measured through administrative evaluation. A small sample of respondents completed online surveys indicating attitudes related to aspects of each model and additional items regarding their level of job satisfaction. Data from these survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients examining relationships among teacher experience, job satisfaction, and perceptions of PRP. Lastly, open-ended comments captured several themes related to evaluation and alternatives to merit pay. In general, teachers did not agree that PRP would improve student learning or provide an incentive to work harder toward improving student achievement. However, there were some indications that the teachers surveyed in the current study may be open to PRP models or features not studied by this research. Teachers also expressed concerns about the fairness and complexity of teacher evaluations. The findings of this study suggest that PRP plans should be better aligned with school goals, and that teacher evaluation systems need to be re-evaluated before considering implementation of a PRP plan.",,,
1119,Adding to the pool of methods for program evaluation: A comparison of latent class analysis and propensity score analysis,"Considering the amount of funding that is distributed to educational research each year, leaders and policymakers have a vested interest in finding scientifically based evidence that answers causal questions regarding program effectiveness. The importance of program evaluation has long been recognized in many fields of research; however, the most appropriate methods for evaluating programs and estimating the causal effect is less clear. In an effort to gain insight into some of the methods used in program evaluation, this dissertation highlights the advantages and disadvantages of a commonly used statistical method called propensity score analysis. Additionally, this dissertation introduces latent class analysis as a possible new method in program evaluation. The dataset chosen for this dissertation comes from a study done by Shadish, Clark, and Steiner (2008), which consists of both a randomized and a quasi-experimental component. In having the unique feature of both a randomized group and a nonrandomized group, I hope to show that latent class analysis can produce similar outcome results as propensity score analysis and a randomized design, while also presenting how the unique features of latent class analysis would be beneficial to program evaluation. The current study consisted of four main analyses. Analysis 1 was a latent class analysis that evaluated the method's ability to work with missing values. Analysis 2 consisted of both a latent class analysis and a propensity score analysis using the Shadish et al. (2008) imputed dataset and all 25 predictor variables. Analysis 3 used the theory-reduced set of variables to conduct multiple latent class analyses and propensity score analyses on four varying sample sizes (i.e., 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%). Analysis 4 conducted multiple latent class analyses and propensity score analyses on the reduced set of variables, created from theory and latent class analysis standards applied to the same four sample sizes from Analysis 3. All propensity score analyses were completed in Stata 12.0, using the pscore command, while, all latent class analyses began in Mplus 6.0, and then were exported to SPSS 20.0 Results of the independent sample t-test, conducted on the randomized dataset, placed the target average treatment value for the vocabulary posttest at 8.11 and the mathematics posttest at 4.19. When looking at each of the analyses, the closest estimate to the randomized design for the vocabulary posttest was produced by the propensity score analysis; while for the mathematics posttest, the closest estimate to the randomized design was calculated by the latent class analysis. In general, the results do not indicate which method is better at producing more accurate average treatment effects. However, the latent class analysis identified four unique response patterns where the individual mean difference varied for each of the classes. This could have interesting potential for many program evaluations.",,,
1120,"Probing interfacial properties of polymeric and soluble surfactants -- New tools, new insights","Surface-active materials such as amphiphilic molecules, copolymers, proteins, and particles are used throughout engineering and science to modify both equilibrium and dynamic properties of fluid-fluid interfaces in applications as varied as wettability modification, emulsification/foaming, and detergency. A significant challenge facing processing engineers in various industries is the ability to create, control or prevent the formation of foam. The rational incorporation of foaming/de-foaming surfactants into industrial formulations thus requires fundamental knowledge of the physico-chemical mechanisms responsible for properties and performance of the processes/products. Over the past 60+ years, a general belief has developed that the surface shear viscosity of a given surfactant solution is correlated to the stability of the foam it produces. Published surface shear viscosity measurements for the heavily-studied foaming surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), however, show almost no agreement. Motivated by a critical re-evaluation, in this dissertation, we use a sensitive technique designed specifically to excite surface shear deformations alone, making the most sensitive and precise measurements to date of the surface shear viscosity of SDS solutions. Our measurements reveal the surface shear viscosity of SDS to be immeasurably low, and below the sensitivity limit of our technique, giving an upper bound on the order of ~10-8 Ns/m. Multiple control and complementary measurements support our conclusion, for SDS and a wide variety of high- and low-foaming soluble surfactants of polymeric, ionic, and non-ionic character. These results cast serious doubt on previous measurements of surface shear viscosity for soluble, small-molecule surfactants in general, and particularly on any foam stability/surface shear viscosity correlations based upon on them. In the second part of the dissertation, we focus on the self-assembly of polymer-based surfactants and nanoparticles on a liquid substrate. These materials are central to many applications, including dispersion stabilization, creation of novel 2D materials and surface patterning. Very often these processes involve compressing interfacial monolayers of particles or polymers to obtain the desired material microstructure. At high surface pressures, however, even highly interfacially-active objects can desorb from the interface. Methods of measuring directly the energy which keeps the polymer or particles bound to the interface (adsorption/desorption energies) are therefore of high interest for these processes. We demonstrate a technique to quantify desorption energies directly, by comparing surface pressure-density compression measurements using a Wilhelmy plate and a custom-microfabricated deflection tensiometer. Focusing on poly(ethylene oxide)-based polymers and nanoparticles, we find that the adsorption energy of PEO homopolymer chains scales linearly with molecular weight, and can be tuned by changing the sub-phase composition. Moreover, the desorption surface pressure of PEO-stabilized nanoparticles corresponds to the saturation surface pressure for spontaneously-adsorbed monolayers, yielding trapping energies of ~ 103 kBT.",,,
1121,Agency and Action: Immigrant Lives and Immigrant Politics in the Deportation Nation,"This dissertation, entitled ""Agency and Action: Immigrant Lives and Immigrant Politics in the Deportation Nation,"" examines the ways in which undocumented Mexican immigrants manage and contest the threat of apprehension and deportation in two communities in California. This project employs a comparative ethnographic approach, including in depth interviews with 61 immigrant respondents in two cities in one county and participant observation in both places over the course of three years. In this study, I make three interrelated arguments: First, the ""post-border"" turn in immigration enforcement demonstrates that the state has geographically displaced but not resolved a growing contradiction between neoliberal economic demands for the free movement of capital and competing national security demands for control over the movement of people. Second, I argue that the increasingly local character of immigration enforcement renders it susceptible to local political climates; this both opens up and closes down avenues to greater inclusion for immigrant communities. Various structural conditions and biographical idiosyncrasies increase or decrease the likelihood of four types of immigrant resistance: avoidance/insulation, ""everyday"" resistance, advocacy, and collective mobilization. Third, at the level of subjectivity, I characterize immigrants who engage in political activism as ""instrumental activists"": willing to participate in social movement organizing, not out of a generalized commitment to social justice, but motivated by material and mundane desires for the betterment of self and family that largely align with largely normative visions of work and family life. Earlier studies of immigration have focused on the mechanisms of social control that circumscribe the life chances of immigrants. In this dissertation, I take a different tack and examine the forms of agency within immigrant communities as people manage intensified risks in their daily lives. While there is a growing literature examining various forms of immigrant agency, these studies tend to focus on only one type of immigrant agency, producing varied empirical portraits of the efficacy and impact of immigrant agency and political activity. I explicitly examine the relationships among four different types of immigrant agency in order to examine the biographical idiosyncrasies and structural conditions that influence the form that immigrant agency will take. These developments raise important questions about shifting forms of state power, the status of race relations in the U.S., and the place of immigrants in liberal democratic and capitalist societies.",,,
1122,Antibody repertoire profiling using bacterial display random peptide libraries for biomarker discovery,"Antibody biomarkers have been used to help diagnose autoimmune, inflammatory, and infectious diseases. Serologic diagnostic assays are non-invasive and relatively inexpensive in comparison to common diagnostic tools. The problem is a majority of diseases do not have a known or reliable biomarker because we lack generally applicable biomarker discovery techniques. To address this problem, we developed a general strategy to identify serum antibody specificities associated with a given disease state and peptide reagents for their detection. To validate the novel antibody repertoire profiling technology, random peptide libraries were screened for peptides that react specifically with antibodies from individuals with celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune disease with well understood pathology. The libraries were screened by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for peptides that simultaneously cross-react with pooled CD patient antibodies present in two separate patient groups labeled with spectrally distinct fluorophores, thus affording a quantitative separation. A panel of six unique peptide sequences yielded 85% sensitivity and 91% specificity on a set of 60 samples not used for discovery, proving the success of the technique. The biomarker discovery technology was further optimized and applied to address an unmet diagnostic need in non-responsive celiac disease (NRCD). Since current assessments of CD recovery are limited to invasive and costly serial duodenal biopsies, we sought to identify novel antibody biomarkers for CD patients that do not respond to traditional therapy. The dominant consensus epitope sequence identified by unbiased library screening was highly similar to reported deamidated gliadin peptide (dGP) B-cell epitopes. Measurement of anti-dGP IgG titer by ELISA discriminated between NRCD and responsive CD patients with 87% sensitivity and 89% specificity. Importantly, dGP antibody titer correlated with the severity of mucosal damage indicating that IgG dGP titers may be useful to monitor intestinal mucosal recovery on a gluten-free diet. Finally, the technology is currently being applied to identify unique antibody specificities in schizophrenia, which is a mental illness that lacks objective diagnostic measurements. These results demonstrate that bacterial display provides a highly effective tool for the unbiased discovery of disease-associated antibody specificities and peptide reagents for their detection that may have broad utility for diagnostic development.",,,
1123,Atom probe tomography of iii-Nitrides,"Atom Probe Tomography (APT) is a technique that couples time of flight mass spectroscopy with an approximate point projection imaging. The advent of ultra-short duration pulsed-lasers with high optical quality has made rapid acquisition of data from materials with poor electrical conductivity practicable. APT analysis of the III-nitrides based devices has value due to the technological significance of these materials. 3D metrology of the active regions of III-nitride based devices provides insight into their electrical/optical performance. APT analysis of a commercial grade c-plane light emitting diode showed that the indium fluctuations in the active region significantly impacted the device's internal quantum efficiency, droop behavior, and current-voltage curves. Comparative analysis was performed on 20-21 and 20-2-1 Gallium Nitride (GaN)-based semipolar light emitting diodes (emission wavelength ~450 nm) using APT. The quantification of 3D Indium distribution in the single quantum well active region in these devices revealed a higher Indium incorporation in the 20-2-1 GaN light emitting diode single quantum well, consistent with the predicted polarization influenced potential energy landscape in the well. APT analysis of aluminum indium nitride nanostructure grown on Gallium Nitride demonstrated the influence of substrate orientation and growth methodology on nanoscale morphology. Gallium Nitride nanorods were also characterized to analyze the indium incorporation in the Indium gallium nitride quantum wells grown on the nanorods' sidewalls.",,,
1124,Si/Ge photodiodes for coherent and analog communication,"High-speed photodiodes have diverse applications in wireless and fiber communications. They can be used as output stages for antenna systems as well as receivers for fiber optic networks. Silicon is an attractive substrate material for photonic components for a number of reasons. Low cost manufacturing in CMOS fabrication facilities, low material loss at telecommunications wavelengths, and relatively simple co-packaging with electronics are all driving interest in silicon photonic devices. Since silicon does not absorb light at telecommunications wavelengths, photodetector fabrication requires the integration of either III-V materials or germanium. Recent work on germanium photodetectors has focused on low-capacitance devices suitable for integration with silicon electronics. These devices have excellent bandwidth and efficiency, but have not been designed for the levels of photocurrent required by coherent and analog systems. This thesis explores the design, fabrication, and measurement of photodetectors fabricated on silicon with germanium absorbing regions for high speed and high power performance. There are numerous design trade-offs between speed, efficiency, and output power. Designing for high bandwidth favors small devices for low capacitance. Small devices require abrupt absorption profiles for good efficiency, but design for high output power favors large devices with dilute absorption. The absorption profile can be controlled by the absorber layer thickness, but this will also affect the bandwidth and power handling. This work quantifies the trade-offs between high speed, high efficiency, and high power design. Intrinsic region thickness and absorption profile are identified as the most important design variables. For PIN structures, the absorption profile and intrinsic region thickness are both functions of the Ge thickness, but in uni-traveling carrier (UTC) structures the absorption profile and intrinsic region can be designed independently. This allows optimization of the absorption profile independently from the RC-limited frequency response and compression current and ultimately enables larger saturation current-bandwidth products. This thesis includes the first theory, fabrication, and measurement of a uni-traveling carrier photodiode on the Si/Ge platform. Key contributions include an accurate nonlinear device model and a complete set of processes and design rules for fabricating Ge devices in the UCSB nanofab. The UTC structure is shown to be useful in extending the bandwidth and power handling capabilities of waveguide-integrated photodiodes, especially at high frequencies.",,,
1125,"Structural evolution of the central schell creek range, White Pine county, Nevada","The central Schell Creek Range (SCR) in eastern Nevada records some of the oldest extensional faulting in the eastern Great Basin. The geometries and kinematics of these early normal faults are poorly documented in this portion of the range, yet they have major implications for the shallow levels of the northern Snake Range metamorphic core complex and faults within major extensional accommodation zones. New detailed 1:12,000 scale geologic field mapping and structural analysis has documented six separate tilt domains along with numerous high- and low-angle, east- and west-dipping-normal faults. Two of the largest and oldest faults are the low-angle, west-directed, Majors Place Detachment (MPD), and the low-angle, east-directed, Schell Peaks Detachment (SPD). These faults along with their hanging wall splays have thinned the exposed rocks underlying the range from 7 km to 2-3 km. The stratigraphy in the footwall of the SPD and MPD is sub-parallel to faults and is largely unmetamorphosed. The SPD has top-to-the-east displacement and shows a switch in the tilt polarity in the hanging wall from west-tilted in the south to east-tilted in the north. The MPD is a west-directed normal fault, and, based on Ar40/Ar39 analysis of footwall rocks and syntectonic ignimbrites in the hanging wall of the MPD (Gans and Norman, in prep.), was active between 35-40 Ma. The MPD cuts hanging wall structures of the SPD implying the SPD is older than the MPD. The SPD and MPD are cut by a second generation of high-angle normal faults associated with the modern range bounding fault system. The data presented here suggests a three stage model for the structural evolution of the central SCR. 1) Cretaceous shortening created ~NNE trending folds across the eastern Great Basin. 2) Extension, beginning in the Eocene, forming closely spaced normal faults - the SPD and MPD. The SPD and MPD possibly exploited the limbs of a pre-existing antiform transecting the SCR. The east-directed SPD exploited the east-dipping limb and the west-directed MPD exploited the west-dipping limb. 3) Miocene and younger range bounding normal fault systems at a high angle to bedding and cut the low-angle faults within the range.",,,
1126,Computational study of a model inverse catalyst and of defects in an oxide surface,"In recent years, significant research efforts on fundamental catalytic research have been undertaken, driven by the need to control and improve heterogeneous catalysis processes at a molecular level. Model systems have been designed and studied to investigate catalytic processes, while most of the work so far has involved metal nanoparticles deposited on oxide supports. Recently, another type of model catalyst system has been suggested which consists of a metal single-crystal surface decorated with submonolayer quantities of an oxide phase. This ""inverse-catalyst model system"" offers interesting possibilities to explore the effects of the metal-oxide interface on the reactivity. In this thesis, we use density functional theory, with the GGA-PBE functional, to investigate the ability of vanadium oxide clusters, supported on Ag or Au, to break the C--H bond in methane. We perform a thermodynamic analysis to show that the VO4 cluster is the most likely oxidant and then proceed to calculate the energy of the dissociative adsorption of methane and its activation energy with the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method. It appears that isolated VO4 clusters supported on Au (111) are promising catalysts for the first step in methane activation, the breaking of the C--H bond. We explain some peculiar features of the reaction path and propose that they are general for alkane activation on oxides. We also observe that the support makes a substantial difference and that Au is a much better support than Ag. This probably happens because Au makes weaker bonds with the oxygen in VO4, or, equivalently, because VO4 binds less strongly to Au than to Ag. We propose that if one compares the activity of the same cluster on a variety of supports, then the reaction energy for the dissociative adsorption is higher when the bond of the cluster to the support is weaker. We emphasize that these ""rules"" are, at this point, based on very few examples and need to be tested further. An important role in catalysis is the surface mobility of active species in the catalytic process and also during activation or regeneration treatments of the catalysts. To quantify the degree of difficulty for VO4 clusters to move on Au (111) and Ag (111) surfaces, we calculate, by using the NEB method, the energy barrier for the motion of the VO4 cluster along the surface. The energy barrier for VO4 moving on a Ag surface is higher than that on a Au surface, which is not surprising considering the bonding character between the cluster and metal surfaces. The high mobility verifies our observation that the bonding connection between the cluster and the surface is much weaker after the dissociation and less sensitive on the positions of the VO4 cluster. We observe that the adsorption and the dissociation of methane on the cluster are equally probable for all intermediate cluster geometries during the motion from one lattice site to another. As another model system for catalysis, MgO oxide surfaces have been an active research topic in the last decade and it is believed that oxygen vacancies on oxide surfaces can participate in various chemical reactions. The formation of oxygen vacancies on MgO surfaces has been studied extensively. However, previous works are largely limited to the neutral case and the studies of charged defects are mainly focus on their geometric and thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, the doping effect is barely included in the previous theoretical works due to its complexity. In this work, we study the geometric and electronic properties of the oxygen vacancies with different charge states on the MgO (001) surface. We have developed a methodology for calculating charged defect formation energies at surfaces. From first-principles calculations we obtain the formation energies of the oxygen vacancies on MgO surface with 0, +, 2+ and -1 charge states under both oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor conditions. We investigate the effects of doping on the formation energy and concentration of oxygen vacancies. The doping effect is considered in our calculations through the corresponding change of the Fermi level. We further study the absorption of oxygen molecules at these vacancies, calculate their relative energetic stability, and analyze its implication on their surface catalytic properties. This study will shed light on the catalytic activity of charged oxygen vacancies on oxide surfaces.",,,
1127,Leveraging heterogeneity for energy optimization and performance enhancement of mobile apps,"High quality cameras, rich wireless connectivity, and augmented sensors available on smartphones and tablets, combined with their increasing computing and communication capabilities, have enabled many new applications. Mobile augmented reality (MAR) and location based services (LBS) are exemplar categories of such emerging apps. While the extreme integration of a mobile system presents a great opportunity for these new apps, it also imposes an extra burden on app development in order to achieve a satisfactory user experience and energy efficiency for these emerging apps. In this thesis, I address two key challenges of realizing these emerging apps on a battery-powered mobile device. First, mapping a compute-intensive app to a heterogeneous multi-core platform has a huge and complex program optimization space. We address this optimization problem by characterizing the computation and power efficiency of mobile cores and accelerators (e.g., the CPU, GPU, and DSP) and developing solutions to assist the app-to-platform mapping based on analysis of the algorithm's data access patterns. We further develop an indoor localization solution which dynamically combines measurements from multiple sensors to jointly estimate the location of a mobile user in an indoor environment. The low quality sensors embedded in the phone often lead to poor location estimations. To boost the estimation accuracy, we develop an adaptive sensor fusion method which combines location estimations from different sources by adaptively calculating the confident level of each estimation source.",,,
1128,"After Plan Chontalpa: The Impact of a Regional Watershed Management Development Program on the Livelihood Strategies of Small-scale Producers in Chontalpa, Tabasco, Mexico","This dissertation analyzes the outcomes of a capital-intensive large-scale development program known as Plan Chontalpa, in the livelihood strategies of small-scale producers in Tabasco, a tropical state located in southeastern Mexico. Drawing on fifteen months of participant observation, interviews and archival research, this person-centered ethnography examines some of the Plan's socio-economic impacts on the livelihoods of a small-scale sugarcane producer, Jesus, from the 1960s when the Plan started to be implemented in the region until today. Though his personal experiences are not identical with other members of his community or residents in other regions, his story offers a valuable reference to a larger ""shared reality"". His experiences are a lens through which to understand the evolution of the Plan, the community, and the environment, from the subsistence farming that characterized the area before the Plan to the sugarcane production that dominates the region today. A political and economic historical perspective is critical in this research as both the town and the Plan have been changing and adapting through time. As a result, the analyses of historical socioeconomic transformations in the Chontalpa shows us the Plan's role as the vehicle of the economic and political integration of the region into the national and international market economy. Consequently, this dissertation argues that local production systems go through transitions that, in many cases, increase economic marginalization, social vulnerability and overexploitation of natural resources on which the local population depend, as a response to these integrations. Despite well-intentioned economic development policies---designed in a framework of moral-economic assumptions different from those of the targeted communities--these initiatives are leading in many cases towards dependency, undermining of local social and economic practices, and negatively impacting the natural environment. Development strategies like Plan Chontalpa continue being implemented despite the shift of the development discourse in recent decades to focus on ""women-centered"" initiatives and environmental sustainability. They are being promoted throughout Latin America as solution to poverty alleviation, and food and energy crises. It is my goal that this study can contribute to better inform future policies in the region.",,,
1129,Interfacial Transport Processes in Microfluidic Systems for Precision Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy,"Microfluidic systems can revolutionize chemical detection by providing accurate chemical analysis in a fraction of the material and time requirements of current laboratory-based techniques. Due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, microfluidic systems can exploit interfacial phenomena to control mass transport and chemical processes with near molecular precision. Coupled together with a label-free detection method such as surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), a generalizable detection scheme can be developed with countless applications. SERS is a powerful detection method able to identify single molecules based on plasmonic enhancement of the molecule's vibrational spectrum. Appropriately nanostructured metals are necessary to achieve the high scattering cross-sections associated with SERS. In this dissertation, engineered systems create microfluidic interfaces for the purpose of chemical detection via SERS. Mass transport across the interfaces was controlled by the interplay of advective and diffusive flows, preferential molecular partitioning between phases, and compartmentalization of chemical reactions spatially and temporally. Chemical detection was achieved by the controlled bottom-up assembly of SERS-active silver nanoparticle clusters. Chemometric analysis methods were developed for the automated identification of target analytes. Three systems were developed to exploit different interfacial effects. Numerical studies in COMSOL were employed to investigate the relevant physical phenomena in each system. (1) In the first, concerted action of the diffusion-driven mass exchange across parallel laminar flows, and the independent control of nanoparticle aggregation enabled the detection of nanomolar concentrations of methamphetamine in saliva samples. (2) The second system used the principles of interfacial tension to produce nanoliter aqueous plugs with very high surface-to-volume ratios, and in this way achieved the 100-fold concentration of a trace vapor analyte. Quantities as low as 2 picograms of 4-amino-thiophenol were detected in real time. (3) Finally, a droplet-based system was developed that enables the encapsulation of small numbers of nanoparticles and analyte molecules within _10 mum diameter droplets. In this way the interactions of very small numbers of the relevant species can be investigated. Together, SERS and microfluidics provide a powerful platform for detection of a wide range of analytes, with unparalleled specificity, precision, and accuracy.",,,
1130,Physical controls to hydrologic exchange and heat exchange at different scales in a large lowland river,"This study investigates the physical controls to hydrologic exchange and heat exchange in a large lowland river at different scales. Through a combination of field experiments and modeling, this work addressed two ecologically-relevant scales in the San Joaquin River, CA: the riffle-pool scale (150 m) and the longitudinal scale (240 km). At the riffle-pool scale, in situ measurements of hydraulic conductivity (ksat) were collected over the length of two riffles, interstitial pore water temperatures were measured within artificial redds, and near-bed temperatures were obtained using 2 km of fiber optic cable and distributed temperature sensing (DTS). These data were used to inform a two-dimensional numerical model of subsurface flow and temperature in gravel bars. Asymmetry of bar morphology is a first-order control to the extent and magnitude of infiltration, which is greater at low flow than high flow. Hydraulic conductivity varies by orders of magnitude and systematic downstream coarsening arises related to the process of bar genesis. The lowest values of ksat were observed where the difference between the topographic gradient and the water surface gradient is at a maximum and thus where the infiltration would be greatest into a uniform bar. Morphology and fine sediment accumulation in recharge zones exert an important control over the mechanisms driving subsurface heat exchange. Conduction dominates heat exchange when infiltration fluxes are _ 0.4 -- 0.9 m/d-1 and depends on sediment grain size. A ksat value of approximately 135 -- 300 m/d-1 is required for advection-dominated exchange. At the longitudinal river scale, a spectral energy balance model was developed, assessed, and used without calibration to investigate the fluvial and hydroclimatological controls to the energy balance over the length of a river during a large-scale flow experiment. Absorbed shortwave radiation is the dominant heat flux and is controlled by changes in sediment, depth, and streamwise patterns in velocity which drive the advective exchange. Downstream variation in sediment results in a 20 percent change to total absorbed radiation and the relationship between net absorption and streambed sediment albedo is shown to be linear. During periods of low flow, up to 45 percent of absorption occurs at the bed.",,,
1131,Fiber-Optic Communications with Advanced Modulation Formats for Datacenter Networks,"It is an obvious trend in our daily life that the world is more and more digitized and connected. It took the human race thousands of years to build the physical world that we are in today, but we have now created a ``virtual'' world in less than half a century. It is made possible because of the deepest understanding in physics and information. We can store all books that were written in human history in just several hard drives. But even then, the digital world has grown so large that it is now starting to show an impact on the physical world, reflected most noticeably by the physical size and power consumption of modern datacenters. It requires information technology to be even more efficient in every way. Datacenters, where centralized computing is performed by thousands of servers, require enormous bandwidth for internal networking as well as input/output. In order to increase capacity per optical wavelength, coherent fiber-optic communications with advanced modulation formats has being developed to increase the spectral efficiency (SE). It is made possible by advances in electronics especially digital signal processing (DSP). High order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) formats which are commonly seen in radio frequency (RF) communication systems, are now at the research frontier for fiber-optic communications. Large constellation such as 256-QAM could provide 8-fold capacity increase over conventional systems with on-off keying (OOK) modulation format at the same modulation speed. However, high order QAM signals require higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and are more vulnerable to fiber impairments such as nonlinearities. In this dissertation we thoroughly studied the principle, implementation and qualification of high order QAM formats in fiber-optic communications, and we demonstrated a dual-channel 96~Gb/s 256-QAM signal transmission over 50~km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF). The link BER was 4 x 10 --4 which is below the forward error correction (FEC) threshold. We studied fiber nonlinear effects such as self-phase modulation (SPM) and cross-phase modulation (XPM) on high order QAM signals. We experimentally determined the nonlinear power thresholds for various conditions such as different transmission distances. Meanwhile, we also explored incorporating advanced modulation formats with ultra-fast optical time-division multiplexing (OTDM) systems. We demonstrated a 64-QAM OTDM experiment and discussed the technical challenges. These results are valuable to our understanding of the system limitations and will help guiding future high SE system design. This technology could enable ultra-high speed optical Ethernet beyond Terabit/s for future datacenter networks.",,,
1132,"Don't Fence Me In: Architecture, Tourism, and Segregation in Las Vegas","Don't Fence Me In: Architecture, Tourism, and Segregation in Las Vegas examines the architecture, planning, and social choices that contributed to the creation of a landscape of heightened inequity in Las Vegas, Nevada, from the development of the Westside to the integration of the school district. This study explores patterns of segregation in Las Vegas and considers the communities and architecture, including clubs, schools and churches, as well as the material culture, such as signage, posters and promotional materials, that expand our understanding of segregated living in the desert city. Intermingled histories of image and building reflect the intersections of both the social and built landscape; therefore, my analysis moves between three scales and modes of evidence---the visual and oral, architectural, and the larger scale of the city. Patterns of discrimination and separation began in the city's earliest days and remnants of these divisions continue to resonate in Las Vegas. Thus, while the period of de facto segregation is the core of this work, chapters are structured chronologically to follow patterns in Las Vegas' racial landscape from the incorporation of the city as a railroad settlement to 1970. These include discussions of Depression-era growth supported by federal investment in the region, the resultant division of labor and community simultaneous with the growth of tourism, creation of the segregated Westside and its clubs and casinos, the opening of the integrated Moulin Rouge, the rise of political resistance in the face of racism, and the results of interstate construction and school district desegregation between 1965 and 1971. This study takes into account Las Vegas' rich material culture and spatial problematic in order to understand the interrelationship of violence, class, racism, and architectural practice that has produced the city's urban and cultural topography and traces the ways in which architecture and urban spaces were implicated in the struggle to locate opportunities for resistance in the face of rapid urban growth and discrimination.",,,
1133,Toward a More Humane Kind of Progress: Alternative Modernities in Post-Civil War Spanish Exile,"Toward a More Humane Kind of Progress: Alternative Modernities in Post-Civil War Spanish Exile investigates the uses of Spanish history and culture for the rehabilitation of the constitutive ideals of European modernity in the creative and theoretical work of three major figures of Spanish exile: Ramon Gaya, Francisco Ayala, and Maria Zambrano. In the case of Ramon Gaya, it finds an effort to posit, by way of the figure of the ""great artist,"" the possibility of a perspective at once sprung from its embeddedness in the world and the relativism such a position implies and at the same time grounded in the living, feeling body. In that of Francisco Ayala, it identifies in the elaboration of a relationship between literary text and meaning distinct from than that between sign and referent a mechanism for transforming the interpretative effort to determine the true meaning of the text from one that suppresses difference and multiplicity to one that motivates empathy. Finally, in philosopher Maria Zambrano's signature concept of razon poetica, or poetic reason, it finds a means of locating an emancipatory social politics within a history structured by inclusion, rather than exclusion. In each chapter, and in particular in the introduction and conclusion, the dissertation attends to the value of the perspectives and ideas it studies to the essential work of understanding and assessing responses to ongoing social and political crises in Spain and beyond.",,,
1135,Impacts of Biodiversity on Sediment Transport in Streams,"Plants and animals can have large impacts on landscape morphodynamics, and a growing body of literature suggests that physical models that do not incorporate these biological impacts can generate qualitatively incorrect predictions of sediment transport. However, work to date has focused almost entirely on the impacts of single, usually dominant, species. In addition, including biological traits of organisms in geomorphic process models remains a challenge. Here, I ask whether multi-species communities have different impacts on sediment mobility compared to single-species systems due to competitive interactions and variation in traits among species. Using a combination of modeling, laboratory, and field studies, I investigate how silk produced by two common species of net-spinning caddisfly larvae (Ceratopsyche oslari, Arctopsyche californica) influences the critical shear stress required to initiate sediment grain motion in streams where the caddisflies are alone in monoculture versus together in polyculture. Experimental results suggest that the presence of caddisfly silk when in monoculture can increase the force required to initiate sediment motion by more than a factor of two. When the species are together in polyculture, critical shear stress increases non-additively. A novel theoretical model that accounts for the mechanical properties, geometry, and vertical distribution of insect silk, as well as interactions between different caddisfly species, on the threshold of sediment motion helps explain how species-specific differences among silk net characteristics, such as tensile strength, can determine the magnitude of the biological effect on incipient sediment motion. Finally, field experiments suggest that non-additive effects of species polycultures on the threshold of sediment motion may be density-dependent and limited to streams in nature where densities are relatively high. Taken collectively, my findings indicate that stream insects can significantly increase the forces required to initiate sediment movement and that species interactions will be an important consideration for future studies that mechanistically link biology and geomorphology.",,,
1136,"The antechamber of zapatismo: National liberation, civil society, and autonomy","This thesis examines the three-decade long evolution of the political proposal of the Zapatista movement pertaining to national liberation, civil society and autonomy articulated through its political culture of opposition and creation, Zapatismo. Drawing upon the communiques, interviews, and declarations of the movement, I argue that the movement's political proposal pertaining to national liberation suggests an alternative modernity until 2001 seeking to transform the modern state-form instead of calling to detach from it as often claimed. Moreover, I argue the failure of the movement in mobilizing Mexican civil society lies in its conceptualization of nation and dignity as horizontal and radically inclusive unifiers among various struggles. Such radical inclusiveness and horizontalism cannot be observed until the 2003 reorganization of the Zapatista bases in the conceptualization of autonomy, which up to date stands to be the most concrete achievement of the movement. Instead, I claim autonomy in Zapatismo acknowledges the need for ""temporary hegemonic mediations,"" a degree of leadership, which defined the framework in which the building of another world should take place. I conclude with the implications of the findings on the increasing horizontalist and autonomist aspirations in global uprisings since 2011.",,,
1137,Characterizing human mobility from mobile phone usage,"Today's mobile information society depends increasingly on the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) such as mobile phones. A thorough understanding of the correlation between mobile phone usage and human mobility will help in predicting people's mobility patterns and therefore provide important guidelines for maintaining sustainable transportation, updating environmental policies, and designing early warning and emergency response systems. This dissertation develops a generalizable framework for extracting and characterizing human mobility patterns from georeferenced mobile phone datasets. It begins with analyzing the different types of information that can be stored in mobile phone datasets. Extended human mobility models and data mining methodologies are developed for spatio-temporal knowledge discovery based on mobile phone data. These models provide the basis for investigating and quantifying the correlation between human physical travel, communication travel, and environmental structure from two perspectives: individual-oriented and urban-oriented. This research also addresses issues of uncertainty, which arise from the natural variability of human mobility, the inaccuracy and imprecision of recorded trajectories, and the imperfection of the underlying models. Finally, a large dataset of northeast China is utilized for a comprehensive evaluation of the developed methods and models and the correlation between spatial structure, human mobility patterns, and mobile phone usage. The intellectual merits of this research include a generalization UML model, algorithms to model movement patterns, and various empirical studies. The results of this research will provide references for policy makers and urban planners to understand the characteristics of individual mobility with wide spread ICT usage, as well as updating environmental and transportation policies. This research enhances our understanding of the relationship between human mobility and ICT in general, and between human mobility patterns and mobile phone usage in particular. In addition, it advances conventional geographic knowledge discovery by focusing on knowledge extraction from sparse datasets with low resolution and individual attributes. The case study from northeast China allows us to examine the influence of mobile phone usage in a highly populated and rapidly developing country.",,,
1138,Re-territorializing Money? International Diffusion and Dollarization,"A significant consequence of economic interdependence has been the informal dollarization of financial systems in many developing countries. Dollarization means that a popular foreign currency comes to perform the traditional functions of money in the domestic economy: unit of account, store of value, and medium of exchange. While dollarization produces benefits - including, typically, defense against inflation and stimulus to investment - it limits the ability of governments to raise revenue through the production of money, restricts the country's ability to conduct monetary and exchange rate policy, and increases exposure to foreign political coercion. My dissertation provides evidence that efforts to reduce dollarization spread among countries through economic connections among governments. The results of my quantitative analysis suggest that policies spread -- or ""diffuse"" -- among governments as a result of learning about how to craft policy.",,,
1139,Adding judgments of understanding and problem-solving transfer to the metacognitive toolbox,"People generally make inaccurate judgments of their knowledge. This is demonstrated by low correlations between learning judgments and learning outcomes in metacomprehension research (i.e., low accuracy). Three experiments investigate how the framing and wording of a metacognitive judgment affects accuracy. Experiments 1 and 2 extend metacomprehension research by systematically varying whether judgment prompts ask for a judgment of learning or understanding, measuring both retention and transfer performance, and using a computer-based multimedia lesson. In two experiments, college students viewed a lesson on how solar cells work and were asked to indicate at five points in the lesson either how well they remember (JOL) the material or how well they understand the material (JOU). Although the pattern of results differed in the two experiments, the combined results yield large correlations between retention and transfer with judgments of understanding (r = .62 and r = .59, respectively), and medium correlations with judgments of remembering (r = .39 and r = .38, respectively). Experiment 3 investigated the effect of framing knowledge judgments for four categories of judgments. The judgment prompts either asked about one's amount of knowledge, one's confidence in knowledge, one's ability to answer questions about their knowledge, or one's perceived difficulty in obtaining knowledge. The former three judgments all significantly predicted retention and transfer performance, but the judgment of difficulty did not predict transfer. These results show the benefits of including judgments of understanding and transfer tests to studies that examine metacomprehension of expository materials, and the importance of choosing appropriate wording for judgment prompts.",,,
1141,It and Bit: Decoherence and Information Storage,"We studied two topics: i) how much physical resources are needed to store information and ii) decoherent histories theory applied to Grover search. Given a system consisting of d degrees of freedom each of mass m to store an amount S of information, we find that its average energy, H, or size, r2, can be made arbitrarily small individually, but its product P = H r2 is bounded below by (exp{S/d} - 1)2d2/m. This result is obtained in a nonrelativistic, quantum mechanical setting, and it is independent of earlier thermodynamical results such as the Bekenstein bound on the entropy of black holes. The second topic is decoherent histories applied to the Grover search problem. The theory of decoherent histories is an attempt to derive classical physics from positing only quantum laws at the fundamental level without notions of a classical apparatus or collapse of the wave-function. Searching for a marked target in a list of N items requires O( N) oracle queries when using a classical computer, while a quantum computer can accomplish the same task in O( N ) queries using Grover's quantum algorithm. We study a closed quantum system executing Grover algorithm in the framework of decoherent histories and find it to be an exactly solvable model, thus yielding an alternate derivation of Grover's famous result. We also subject the Grover-executing computer to a generic external influence without needing to know the specifics of the Hamiltonian insofar as the histories decohere. Depending on the amount of decoherence, which is captured in our model by a single parameter related to the amount of information obtained by the environment, the search time can range from quantum to classical. Thus, we identify a key effect induced by the environment that can adversely affect a quantum computer's performance and demonstrate exactly how classical computing can emerge from quantum laws.",,,
1142,"Viola Transcriptions: History, Rationale, and Process, with Focus on Selected Works by August Halm","Since the viola attained soloist status in the early to mid 20 th Century, violists have been faced with the never-ending task of matching the performance standards of their more agile violin brethren. Much of the violinist's technical facility comes from their study of pre-twentieth century musical offerings; yet, the development of the viola student is handicapped by the lack of original viola repertoire from that time. More repertoire of this ilk needs to be made available as transcriptions to violists. Moreover, violists should be the ones creating these transcriptions because they know best the intricacies of the instrument. This may seem a daunting task since not all violists are experienced in composing or transcribing. Further, no standard transcribing process exists in print. The aim of this document is to purpose a set of general guidelines for transcribing music from the violin to the viola, while isolating the various problems that can occur during that process. The Two Sonatas for Violin and Piano, as well as the Three Solo Sonatas for Violin of German composer, August Halm (1869--1929), will serve as the case study from which to build this method. While Halm is admittedly a Modern era composer, his compositional style leans more heavily on Bach, Beethoven, and Bruckner than his contemporaries. A secondary aim of this document is to inform the reader of Halm's pedagogical and theoretical opinions, and to demonstrate how they remain relevant for today's performers and students.",,,
1143,Continuum and coarse-grained modeling of lipid bilayer membranes,"Biological membranes are complex mixtures of lipids, proteins, and other molecules that serve versatile functions within living organisms. The lipid membrane serves as the primary barrier between the cell and the outside world and serves within cells as the boundaries of organelles. Biological membranes play an important role in cellular functions through their many embedded proteins whose collective organization and functions depend importantly on the mechanical interplay with the lipid bilayer. To gain insight into biological processes requires an intrinsic understanding of the basic mechanisms by which inclusions such as proteins interact with the lipid bilayer structures. This has been an active area of research. We contribute through the development of new models and computational methods at both the level of continuum mechanics and at more mesoscopic scales where essential features of lipids are taken into account at a coarse-grained level to gain efficiencies over fully atomistic descriptions. We use these new approaches to perform a number of investigations of lipid bilayer membranes and protein interactions to gain new insights. First we introduce continuum methods at the level of individual proteins embedded within the bilayer in a manner closely related to the Immersed Boundary Method. We approximate the membrane-protein interaction by introducing a kernel function in the Hamiltonian that modifies the membrane energy in the neighborhood of the protein location. The proteins are naturally represented using a Lagrangian reference frame that tracks location while the membrane is represented using an Eulerian reference. In the same spirit as the Immersed Boundary Method, the kernel function serves to couple the Eulerian and Lagrangian representations without resorting to explicit boundary conditions. By approximating the interaction in this manner at the level of the Hamiltonian, a set of self-consistent forces are obtained that act to deform the membrane and to perturb the protein. As we shall discuss in more detail, we capture in our model the elastic mechanics of the bilayer, membrane tension, leading-order hydrodynamic interactions, and thermal fluctuations. For proteins that induce curvature, we show how the numerical approach has important consequences for the effective diffusivity of embedded proteins. We also provide a condition which ensures that the system satisfies detailed balance with respect to the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution, which when analyzing prior work in the literature we find is often overlooked. This property turns out to be non-trivial in such approximate models since when both the protein and membrane simultaneously fluctuate important stochastic cross-terms are required that are difficult to treat. Some interesting features we can study with our methods include how collective effects arising from different area fractions of the embedded proteins impact the membrane bending mechanics. We find these can have a significant impact on the spectrum of bending fluctuations and on the renormalized flexural rigidity of the membrane bilayer sheet. In recent experiments by the group of Patricia Bassereau (Marie Curie Institute, Paris), protein diffusion within lipid bilayer membranes subjected to various levels of tension have been studied. By using quantuum dots, protein locations have been tracked at the single molecule level providing an ensemble of trajectories for different levels of tension. Interestingly, whethor tension effects diffusivity depends importantly on the level of apparent curvature a protein induces in the bilayer. We have collaborated with this research group to help understand these findings by performing simulation studies using our membrane-protein model and developing related theory. Overall, our modeling approach and computational methods are quite general and we expect they could be useful in the investigation of a wide variety of phenomena involving membrane-protein interactions. At the molecular level of description we have also investigated coarse-grained models for the lipid bilayer vesicle. Our description of the bilayer is based on the implicit-solvent coarse-grained (IS-CG) lipid model developed by Markus Deserno, Kurt Kremer, and Ira R. Cooke for equilibrium studies. We extend this work for studies of dynamic processes within bilayers by using the Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian Method (SELM) to couple the coarse-grained model to fluctuating hydrodynamic fields. This approach provides a thermostat incorporating momentum-transfer from the the hydrodynamics of the surrounding solvent that would otherwise be missing in such implicit-solvent descriptions. In the past, the Deserno-Cooke IS-CG models have primarily been concerned with equilibrium properties of bilayers and used Langevin thermostats which neglect these effects. We have shown that by incorporating the hydrodynamics important correlations are manifested within the bilayer that could play an important role in many processes within the bilayer, such as the transport of proteins or the kinetics of self-assembly. To obtain continuum fields for comparison presents a number of challenges. We develop a fitting method for lipid bilayer vesicles based on the use of spherical harmonic (SPH) representation of the vesicle shape. We use the SPH representation to perform a spectral analysis of vesicle shape fluctuations.",,,
1144,When Attention Fails: Exploring the Theoretical and Empirical Significance of Task Difficulty during the Attentional Blink,"There is simply too much information in our environment to process. Attention allows for the selective processing of relevant information, at the expense of other information. Importantly, attention has both a spatial and a temporal distribution. While the spatial distribution of attention has commonly been measured by having individuals attend to one location over another, the temporal distribution of attention has been studied by examining the influence that selecting and processing one item has on the processing of subsequently presented information. For instance, in studies of the attentional blink (AB), two targets are presented in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of distractors. When the second target (T2) is presented within 200-500 ms after the first target (T1), there is a substantial decrease in accuracy on the T2 task. In contrast to the spatial distribution of attention, this decrease in accuracy has commonly been attributed to a failure of attention at a post-perceptual, or late, level of selection. While T1-difficulty has been studied extensively, as it has important theoretical contributions, studies attributing the AB to post-perceptual processes have repeatedly failed to manipulate task difficulty. This is particularly problematic, as task difficulty has been found to be critical to observe the influence of attention on earlier perceptual processing. The current experiments critique and falsify previous attempts to explain the influence of T1-difficulty, show that T1-difficulty influences early perceptual processing of task-irrelevant information, and demonstrate that flexible processing of T2 occurs independent of T1-difficulty. In short, these experiments disprove one of the most basic assumptions regarding the temporal distribution of attention and prove that flexible processing of information is not only a basic characteristic of attention in space, but also in time.",,,
1145,Linewidth narrowing and the onset of coherence collapse in an integrated hybrid Silicon laser with external feedback,"The effect of power, length and external reflectivity and its impact on key laser parameters such as linewidth broadening and power spectra are investigated utilizing hybrid silicon lasers coupled to ultra-low-loss waveguides (ULLW's) in a completely integrated system. Numerical simulations are done utilizing non-linear rate equations. Process flow is examined in mitigating the inadvertent effects that arise in fabrication of this system and address the best methods for controlling key parameters pertinent to linewidth narrowing. Time-domain and power spectra are captured to determine linewidth broadening as a function of feedback. Limiting terms such as feedback lengths, laser power, and interface reflectivities are analyzed and the best parameters for operation in the area of narrowest linewidth are determined. It is determined that increasing the length and reducing intensity noise will result in the narrowest linewidth laser.",,,
1146,"Group Agency, Moral Agency, and Moral Patiency","This dissertation focuses on the phenomenon of group agency and its moral and social implications. I begin by examining the history of collective intentionality and addressing some of the early criticisms. While I admit to many problems associated with original theories, I discuss more nuanced approaches in theories of intention that have relevance for a narrower conception group intentions (and thereby group agency), particularly theories developed by Peter French and Philip Pettit and Christian List. I then defend the basic features of these views against several current and likely critics. These are the main emphases of Chapters 1 and 2. Despite the plausibility of group agency, the concerns regarding group moral agency remain, which I address in Chapter 3. Group agents, particularly exemplified by the large modern business corporation, exert a tremendous amount of power over the direction of the economy and society, some of which are problematic and present key challenges for members of a polity. Without proper administrative structure, such group agents are unlikely to be responsive to moral reasons. I present and defend two key structural features of group agents that should help to make a group agent more likely to be responsive to moral reasons, elements of the grant theory of incorporation and Christopher McMahon's theory of managerial democracy. I finally explore the limitations of group moral agency in Chapter 4. While it is possible that a moral agent is capable of acting and having intentions in a way that is generally responsive to moral reasons, I point out that there are arguments against the view that a group moral agent can also be a group moral patient. If group agents are not moral patients, they cannot be accorded moral rights. The implications for this view are that corporations and other highly structured organizations have no moral right to engage in lobbying practices to affect government policy. I point out other avenues of rights for group agents, but they cannot serve as the basis for a right to lobby the government directly.",,,
1147,Mother-son conflict over sib-mating,"Genomic conflict occurs when mothers, sons, and daughters bear asymmetrical costs and benefits associated with sib-mating. This conflict was quantified by using Hamilton's rule of altruism as a framework. We show that mothers are selected to prevent inbreeding in their offspring when CSis/BBro > 1, where CSis and BBro represent the sister's cost and the brother's benefit from a sib-mating. This relationship sometimes leads to conflict between a mother and her son, because sons are selected to mate their sisters when Csis/BBro < 2. Drosophila melanogaster provided a useful model system with which to test one application of this theory because i) brothers feasibly benefit from mating their sisters while mothers are harmed from such sib-mating, and ii) despite the smaller size of males relative to females, males have counter-intuitively longer egg-to-adult development time than their sisters. We hypothesized that mothers use maternal effects to delay the development of their sons relative to their daughters, allowing the females of a brood to disperse before males eclose and become sexually competent -thus avoiding sib-mating. We further hypothesized that epigenetic modification of the Y chromosome could be the mechanism by which mothers manipulate the development of their sons. To test our hypothesis, we created females with paternally inherited Y chromosomes and males that lacked Y chromosomes. With these constructs, we predicted that sex-specific maternal effects would decrease the sexual dimorphism of development time when both sexes of offspring carry a Y chromosome, and would reverse the trend when sisters (but not brothers) carry a Y chromosome. No change in the development time of sons and daughters was observed in response to our experimental manipulation of the presence/absence of Y chromosomes in sons and daughters. While our experimental results indicate that maternal epigenetic modification of a son's Y chromosome is not responsible for delayed male development in D. melanogaster, our modeling analysis clearly demonstrates the opportunity for mother-son conflict over a wide region of parameter space.",,,
1148,"Herbivore Community Dynamics and Functional Compositions in Moorea, French Polynesia","Herbivorous fishes and sea urchins help control coral community structure by grazing both micro- and macroalgae and are vital to coral reef resilience and recovery. The two major groups of herbivores present in Moorea are herbivorous fishes and the sea urchin Diadema savignyi. D. savignyi occurs in two abundance states in the lagoon habitats of Moorea: a low abundance state where urchins occur as solitary individuals and a high abundance state in which individuals occur in aggregations. Using a combination of field surveys and experiments, results indicated that the observed spatial patterns of abundance are likely alternative stable states in population abundance that can be explained by the existence of alternative attractors in the population dynamics of D. savignyi.. This dissertation also assesses the changes in the functional composition of the herbivorous fish assemblage following two large disturbances on Moorea. Results showed that despite having unique functional assemblages among the fringing reef, back reef, and fore reef habitats, the herbivorous fish communities at all three habitats responded similarly to the two disturbances by moving towards communities with increased representation of scrapers. The increase in scrapers appear to be sufficient thus far in preventing a regime shift from occurring as macroalgae remains a relatively minor space holder and a massive recruitment of juvenile coral has been observed on the fore reef. I also assessed the amount of functional redundancy that exists in the herbivore community, how functional redundancy changed among functional groups due to the disturbances, and the amount of response diversity among species of the same functional group. Results indicate that not only is functional redundancy higher for ""preventer"" functional groups (i.e., those that prevent macroalgal establishment) than ""removers"" (i.e., those that remove established macroalgae) but that functional redundancy also increased following the disturbances for ""preventers"" but decreased for ""removers"". Results also showed that a considerable amount of response diversity occurred among species of the same functional group suggesting that the herbivore community of Moorea may be able to withstand a variety of disturbances as there is large variation in how functionally similar species respond to perturbations.",,,
1149,An Exploration of GaN-based Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors,"In this work, the exploration of GaN based Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors (HBTs) is presented. The material properties of GaN, specifically, the high critical electric field for breakdown and the high electron saturation velocity combined with the merits of an HBT such as high transconductance, normally-off operation, high power density, uniform threshold voltage, etc. make GaN HBTs attractive for high frequency and high power applications. AlGaN/GaN HBTs structures grown by MOCVD typically have a problem of Mg diffusion from the base into the emitter layers during growth, resulting in a Mg concentration tail in the emitter layer. To circumvent this problem, Ga-polar AlGaN/GaN HBTs grown by MOCVD with Regrown Emitters were fabricated. The HBTs had a high current density with good current gain. However, the fabrication of these devices revealed a problem of effectively activating the p-type GaN base layer buried underneath the emitter layer. Ammonia Molecular Beam Epitaxy (NH3 MBE) is attractive as an alternate method for the growth of GaN HBTs and other vertical devices. Chief benefits include sharp Mg concentration profiles, absence of Ga-filled dislocations that can cause vertical leakage currents, and active p-type layers. AlGaN/GaN HBTs grown by NH3 MBE are demonstrated. To obtain good ohmic contacts to the base layer, devices were fabricated with two different processes involving regrowths---Regrown base contact and Regrown emitter. HBTs with high current density and current gain were obtained by both processes and the results are discussed. High base resistance is found to limit the performance of the devices. InGaN layers doped with Mg are a better option compared to GaN as the base layer of the HBT. Due to higher ionization efficiency of Mg in InGaN than GaN, higher hole concentrations can be obtained in p-type InGaN layers. GaN/InGaN/GaN HBTs with Common-Emitter operation and good collector current densities are demonstrated. Recombination of electrons at the emitter sidewalls and extrinsic base surface due to ion etch-damage is found to lower the current gain. A photoelectrochemical (PEC) etch treatment is found to enhance device performance and is discussed. High hole concentrations can be obtained in graded AlGaN or InGaN layers doped with Mg by the mechanism of polarization-induced doping. N-polar GaN enables design of HBTs with graded base layers that can have high hole concentrations from polarization doping as well as quasi-electric fields that propel electrons from emitter to collector enhancing current gain. N-polar HBTs were constructed using both MOCVD and NH3 MBE growth techniques. The device results are presented. Problems in the device behavior and possible solutions are discussed. Finally, Collector-up Ga-face HBTs were investigated. Collector-up HBT structure has the advantage of lower Base-Collector capacitance but the disadvantage of undesired injection and recombination of electrons from the emitter to the extrinsic base region. In addition, HBTs with graded base layers can be designed to obtain polarization hole doping as well as quasi electric field in the base similar to the N-polar HBTs while employing the more mature Ga-polar growth to grow the devices. The device results are presented and future challenges are presented.",,,
1151,Self-assembly of conjugated polymers and small-molecules,"Organic semiconductors have shown promise in a number of applications well-suited to their low-cost and compatibility with large-scale manufacturing methods, but much remains unknown about the self-assembly and structure that leads to high performance devices and materials. Focusing on the newest generation of solar cell and thin-film transistor materials, we investigate the self-assembly of a series of high-performance small-molecule and polymer materials. The work primarily uses transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate short- and long-range crystalline order unique to each material, aspects of the morphology that are difficult to observe by any other technique. Two common themes emerge in the thin-film morphologies. First, neighboring crystallites often adopt a preferred epitaxial arrangement known as a quadrite. Such an interface is intimately related to the details of the molecular structure; their presence is expected to be beneficial to the transport properties by increasing the connectivity on the nano-scale and allowing dead-ends, defects and grain-boundaries to be bypassed efficiently. Second, a portion of the film is found to possess micron-scale orientational order while simultaneously coexisting with a more complex nano-structure. This order can be confined to a single apparent layer similar to a liquid crystal or several overlapping layers. In addition to the TEM investigations, a new technique, polarization-dependent photoconductive atomic force microscopy was developed to investigate the consequences of micron-scale orientational order on the opto-electronic properties of a device. Overall, the results suggest that both the epitaxial and long-range order are important aspects in the best materials and that explicitly engineering self-assembly into these new materials may lead to better devices.",,,
1152,Studies on Cambrian Small Shelly Fossils,"Phosphatized and phosphatic small shelly fossils are a major source of information about Cambrian animal evolution, but many remain enigmatic, both with regard to their phylogenetic affinities and the overall morphology of the animal from which they came. Four studies on these fossils are presented. First, Cambrothyra is a jar-shaped fossil that has often been interpreted as a protistan test, but a detailed redescription based on specimens from the lower Cambrian of southern Shaanxi Province, China, supports the identification of it as the sclerite of a coeloscleritophoran, a problematic group of Cambrian scleritome-bearing metazoans. In particular, Cambrothyra resembles chancelloriids, but differs from them in having simple rather than compound sclerites. Second, results are presented on large samples of chancelloriid sclerites from the Meishucunian of eastern Yunnan Province, China (Dahai Member, Zhujiaqing Formation, and Shiyantou Formation). The material from the Dahai Member appears to come from a single species, while statistical analysis of morphotype co-occurrences in different samples suggests that at least four species are present in the Shiyantou Formation. The species from the Dahai Member is among the oldest well-characterized chancelloriids, and the irregularity and poor organization of its sclerites compared to those of younger forms support the hypothesis that chancelloriid sclerites are compound structures arising from the fusion of originally separate elements. In the third study, two further fossils are described from the Xihaoping Member: a cap-shaped fossil with a spine on its lower surface, and Acidocharacus, a tall spine, often bearing barbs, attached to a rounded conical base. Both of these fossils appear to be sclerites and may have functioned as attachment sites for soft tissues, but their affinities remain unknown. Finally, new microstructural data are presented for hyoliths, a group of problematic calcareous fossils, based on material from the middle Cambrian Gowers Formation of Queensland. These preserve a lamello-fibrillar microstructure reminiscent of both some molluscs and some annelids. Because of the convergent evolution of lamello-fibrillar microstructures in different groups of animals, it does not offer clear support for any particular phylogenetic position for hyoliths; instead, this plywood-like microstructure probably evolved to strengthen the shell against predators.",,,
1153,Nineteenth-century playground: Imagining the past in contemporary middlebrow culture,"This dissertation investigates the diverse and abundant afterlife of the British nineteenth century in contemporary culture, arguing that contemporary appropriations of nineteenth-century culture use narrative forms to reimagine the period as a site of immersive and creative play. My work advances current scholarship on the legacy of nineteenth-century culture by focusing on an area of critical oversight in neo-Victorian studies: the ""middlebrow,"" or the cultural space where high art merges with mass culture. Despite scholars' tendency to ignore the middlebrow in favor of ""high brow"" works, I demonstrate that middlebrow culture is not only worthy of academic inquiry, but that it is in fact integral to contemporary conceptions of the nineteenth century within both popular and academic circles. To this end, I investigate a diverse body of cultural objects, including adaptations of Jane Austen's novels in fiction and film; the prolific afterlife of Jack the Ripper; reinterpretations of Victorian media in contemporary film and comics; and the practice of ""visiting"" the Victorian through literary tourism. I argue that these seemingly disparate objects and activities all function according to a similar logic of imaginative play. Recent research has shown that play is a formative mode of human behavior that contributes to identity formation and our ability to imagine the minds of others. Using theories of play drawn from cultural history, psychoanalysis, and developmental psychology, I assert that the nineteenth century has come to function as a cultural and psychological playground within the middlebrow, a space that allows its players to work through contemporary anxieties about cultural change, shifting gender and sexual mores, modern violence, and evolving media. My work demonstrates that, despite prevalent assumptions that middlebrow culture's use of the nineteenth century is an exercise in uncritical nostalgia, middlebrow appropriations of this period often function as productive--if at times problematic--modes of historical engagement that, through play, promote social understanding and self expression. These reiterations of the nineteenth century offer significant insight into the period's cultural legacy, the uses of history in contemporary culture, and the role of play in modern life.",,,
1154,TraJECT-3D: Track and Junction Based Exploit over Complex Terrain,"This thesis presents TraJECT-3D (Track and Junction based Exploit over Complex Terrain), a realistic generator of node movement trajectories for simulating tactical Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs). TraJECT-3D models the macro- and micromobility of different types of tactical nodes (e.g., soldiers, scouts, unmanned aerial vehicles) with a bidirectional track and junction strategy. The novel aspects and distinguishing features of our mobility model are: (1) supporting a three-dimensional topology which is essential for realistic modeling of tactical scenarios in difficult terrains, and (2) considering variable-size group mobility, multiple mission-based formations, and the inclusion of aerial traffic at the macro-mobility level and correlated movements at the micro-mobility level. TraJECT-3D is validated by illustrating how the interactions between terrain characteristics, macro-mobility and micro-mobility models reproduce typical phenomena of tactical networks. Evaluation results show that the choice of mobility model heavily impacts node movement and density over terrain which in turn has a large impact on the performance of networking protocols.",,,
1155,The influence of savanna oaks on california grassland plant composition,"Over the last century many of the world's grassland and savanna communities have experienced significant changes in the abundance of shrubs and trees. In light of this there is a need to better understand the influences of trees on the herbaceous community. In particular, the potential for trees to exert long-term impacts on communities following their death and the role of spatial factors such canopy size or isolation in determining species diversity have rarely been evaluated in a single system. I used observational and experimental approaches to explore the overarching question: how do isolated Quercus in California grasslands affect the surrounding community? I specifically tested whether co-occurring deciduous and evergreen oaks influence understory composition differently and how this influence varies along a latitudinal gradient in California using an extensive survey. Because canopy oaks die often or have been actively removed I also evaluated the longevity of tree impact by surveying dead individuals. Using this survey data I examined how spatial heterogeneity in resources created by savanna trees as well as their relative arrangement within the grassland matrix contributes to landscape patterns of species richness. Lastly, I performed an experiment manipulating the mechanisms by which trees might create gradients in vegetation, focusing on the response of two species of native perennial grass that are potential restoration targets. I found a regionally consistent influence of oaks on understory species composition; all oaks were associated with increased abundance of non-native annual grasses. This pattern continued long after the death of the tree. Community composition outside the canopy did differ between evergreen and deciduous trees. These differences were correlated with the density of shallow oak roots and not environmental differences. Oak trees also added species to the landscape pool, especially those with large canopy areas. Experimental manipulation of possible mechanisms suggested that for some native perennial grasses, a major limiting factor under oaks is interference from non-native annual grasses, particularly under trees. Together, these results suggest the influence of Quercus on California grasslands is multi-faceted, and may contribute to the distribution of non-native species on the landscape after extant trees are gone.",,,
1157,Dynamic nuclear polarization instrumentation and methodology for generating high signal sensitivity and signal contrast,"Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is an NMR method to dramatically increase NMR sensitivity and generate signal contrast by transferring the high spin polarization of electrons to nuclear spins. As an emerging NMR technique that directly addresses the inherent lack of sensitivity of NMR, the instrumentation and methodology for this technique is still in its discovery phase. This dissertation will expound on the DNP instrument and methods development to achieve the goals of generating high nuclear spin polarization, and the usage of that polarization to obtain structural information in solids and generate signal contrast for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The design, performance optimization and implementation of solid state DNP (ssDNP) and liquid state Overhauser DNP-MRI (ODNP-MRI) is presented. A series of ssDNP instrument improvements culminated in the achievement of up to 61 % nuclear spin polarization in the solid state and the ability to perform versatile fundamental studies on the effect of polarizing agent, electron spin concentration, temperature and nuclear spin density on ssDNP. A case study on triblock co-polymer hydrogels was performed to demonstrate the ability of ssDNP to provide structural information in solids, revealing the capability of ssDNP detect domain separation and provide domain lengthscales from the DNP buildup measurement. To demonstrate the ability of DNP to provide signal contrast, DNP optimization was conducted in the liquid state where the ODNP mechanism is responsible for polarization transfer via the electron and nuclear spin motion. The signal enhancement and signal phase inversion generated by ODNP on water resulted in the ability to distinguish between incoming flow of ODNP-enhanced water and unenhanced bulk water during MRI. This enabled in vitro and in vivo ODNP-MRI studies with applications in microfluidics imaging and biomedical imaging. The versatility of DNP to advance different magnetic resonance fields both in the solid and liquid state shows that the enhanced signal sensitivity and contrast produced by DNP can extend magnetic resonance techniques beyond the current state of the art.",,,
1158,Anxiety and Test Anxiety: General and Test Anxiety Among College Students with Learning Disabilities,"This study compares the state, trait, and test anxiety scores of 145 college students with and without learning disabilities against categories such as demographics, general anxiety, test anxiety, and disability experience. This study used a questionnaire and compared answers among groups. The analysis indicated that students with learning disabilities have a statistically significant difference on trait, F(1, 143) = 9.83, p = .002, and test scores, F(1, 142) = 11.97, p = .001, when compared to students without disabilities. This study found that anxiety statistically significantly affects college students with learning disabilities in terms of age, years in school, gender, perception of grades, self-reported anxiety ratings, feelings of control, and Office of Disability experience. This study informs future research regarding many variables affecting college students with learning disabilities.",,,
1159,Honor and dignity culture differences in the concept of worth: Consequences for response to group insults,"Honor cultures place importance on socially conferred worth, reputation, and a positive social image, all of which can be granted or taken away by others. In contrast, dignity cultures place importance on context independent, individual, and inherent worth, which is less affected by the social regard of others. Thus, responding to insults is more important in honor cultures than dignity cultures. Study 1 first examined students' responses to different insults from a faculty group to a student group in the UAE (honor culture) and in the USA (dignity culture). This cross-cultural comparison of honor and dignity concerns was intended to illustrate whether heightened responses to group insult occur in honor cultures. Results exhibited initial evidence for differences in group-based responses to insults in the sampled honor and dignity cultures. Study 2 delved into the measurement of honor and dignity values. It sought to explain findings from Study 1 involving self-reported endorsement of honor or dignity culture values. Results demonstrated two separate underlying constructs for dignity and honor values.",,,
1160,Public At Work: Direct Job Creation Policy From The New Deal to the Rise of Reagan,"At the lowest ebb of the Great Depression, the Federal government broke with centuries of economic orthodoxy to grapple with an economic crisis that had thrown anywhere from a quarter to a third of the American workforce onto the breadlines. For the first time in American history, the government would directly employ the jobless in an effort to bring down national unemployment rates. ""Public At Work: Direct Job Creation Policy From the New Deal to the Rise of Reagan"" traces the tumultuous and often unexplored history of direct job creation policy, beginning with an exploration of the intellectual and programmatic development of the Works Progress Administration within the New Deal and its impact on the Great Depression, which was far more successful in combating mass unemployment than many historians have recognized. By 1945-6, when debates over full employment consumed the Congress, direct job creation stood at the verge of becoming the foundation of American economic and social welfare policy. ""Public At Work"" points to intellectual and ideological choices within liberalism as the reason why at the very moment when the Full Employment Bill of 1945 promised to make the U.S a leader in the full employment field, jobs policy was rapidly de-institutionalized and pushed to the margins of policy discourse. Despite this setback, direct job creation survived as an intellectual and policy contender within the War on Poverty task forces where it challenged then-dominant ""culture of poverty"" theories of poverty - creating a bridge between New Deal liberalism and post-war liberalism. ""Public At Work"" concludes by demonstrating how direct job creation -- through the vehicle of the Humphrey-Hawkins Act -- was very much the fulcrum of the crisis of the New Deal order, as the collapse of the Keynesian consensus divided the economic establishment and the Democratic Party at a time of high unemployment and high inflation.",,,
1161,Human Craniofacial Variation among Pacific Rim Populations through the Holocene: A Test of the Coastal Migration Hypothesis using 3D Morphometric Methods,"This dissertation research is directed at understanding migration patterns of the New World's first inhabitants. Although the question of the origins of the first Americans has been resolved through molecular research, the migration routes of the earliest inhabitants continue to be intensely debated among scholars. The traditional migration hypothesis maintains that the first Americans traveled by foot across the Bering Land Bridge and into the interior of North America in search of megafauna. However, recent archaeological, genetic, and bioarchaeological research suggests that a Pacific Rim coastal migration may have occurred during the initial colonization of the Americas. Based on these lines of evidence, this research seeks to investigate whether the skeletal morphology of the earliest American inhabitants show affinities to skeletons from the Pacific Coast, supporting the coastal migration model, or the interior, supporting the Clovis model. To investigate this question, three-dimensional (3D) imaging and geometric morphometric methods were used to examine craniofacial variation among early Holocene Paleoamerican (skeletons >8,000 cal BP) and a comparative Holocene (7,500 - 1,000 cal BP) sample from 30 coastal and interior sites in North and South America. A NextEngine 3D laser scanner was used to create high resolution models of human crania and a digital replica of the original cranium, which were then used to record craniofacial landmarks. The coordinate data were used to assess variation using a suite of 3D geometric morphometric procedures. The assessments of cranial variation among the comparative sample of coastal and interior groups showed that the coastal populations are slightly more heterogeneous than the interior groups. The computed distances showed closer affinities between the Paleoamerican and coastal samples, respectively. Procrustes distances were smaller between several Paleoamericans and the coastal samples, but some Paleoamericans also were also very similar to interior samples. The posterior probabilities classified all the Paleoamerican skeletons in coastal groups, providing more definitive support for the Coastal Migration Hypothesis. This research is in accordance with recent archaeological, genetic, and geological studies that support an early coastal migration during the initial peopling of the New World.",,,
1162,An overview of hgcdte mbe defects and analysis of defect size,"HgCdTe is the most widely used material for high performance infrared detection applications. Growth of HgCdTe epitaxial layers by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has ushered in advanced devices that take advantage of the unique properties of the material. Formation of defects during the growth process is one of the largest drawbacks to this technology, and must be minimized to increase device operability. In this paper, the defects encountered in HgCdTe are categorized, along with formation mechanisms and possible means of reduction. A new method of defect identification is proposed, which takes advantage of full wafer defect mapping capabilities. A correlation between the thickness of the grown film and the size of defects initiated at the substrate surface is found. This allows further defect information to be extracted from the size and density of the defects.",,,
1163,Broadband Simulation With Physics-based Seismic Source Models,"This dissertation focuses on using dynamic rupture models to study earthquake source physics and generate earthquake scenarios for the sake of regional seismic hazard estimation. We use a 3D finite element code MAFE (Ma and Liu, 2006) to study rupture dynamics. This code is capable of incorporating 3D velocity structure, non-planar fault geometry and topographical effect with a linear slip-weakening friction relationship. We also use the UCSB method toolchain in the SCEC BBP platform to calculate broadband ground motion due to an earthquake scenario. Our study of dynamic rupture interpretation of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake suggested a simple patchy initial stress model could explain the major features observed by seismic inversion techniques, which results complicated local tectonic environment. Our study of the ground motion level due to potential seismic hazard due to Wasatch Fault Salt Lake City (WFSLC) segment indicates the ground motion level should be pretty consistent with the GMPE predictions. In addition, we discussed how the non-trivial fault geometry of WFSLC would affect the ground motion in the earthquake scenarios.",,,
1164,"Survivors Ink: Self-Transformation, Self-Creation and Healing Through Tattoo","This dissertation is an analysis of the mechanism by which tattoo acts as a method of self-transformation, coping and self-healing for young college-educated Chicanas. The purpose is to investigate how tattoo, accessing complex mind/brain/body interconnections, allows participants to re-negotiate and transform the meaning of stressful and/or traumatic events into narratives of strength, agency and survival. While tattoo has been explored as a means of empowerment, there has not been an empirically grounded examination of the mechanisms by which tattoo might act as a practical therapeutic tool. My focus is on college-educated Chicanas/Latinas between 18 and 40 years old. This embodied subject position offers an opportunity to investigate how intersecting vectors of oppression shape participants' experience as one of self-transformation, healing and agency. I argue that a consideration of the ways in which gender, race, culture and class intersect is critical in understanding how participants construct meaning around stressful and/or traumatic events and circumstances. Methodologically, my research model combines quantitative and qualitative data collection methods in a 3-phase interdisciplinary project. In Data Collection Phase 1, a heterogeneous sample of 588 undergraduate and graduate students responded to an online questionnaire entitled ""The General Tattoo Perceptions and Practices Questionnaire."" This established a baseline for cross-comparison of attributes, backgrounds, and life experiences. In Data Collection Phase II, the online questionnaire entitled ""The Chicana Tattoo Questionnaire"" gathered 38 tattooed Chicana participant responses across multiple lines of inquiry, including motivations and level of bodywork. Data Collection Phase 3 used 8 personal interviews to probe individual histories and uncover relationships between tattoos and ideas of coping/healing. Analyzing these, I used a grounded-theory approach integrated with phenomenological analysis. Examining the crosscutting influences of gender, class, ethnic and cultural status, we see how tattoo's unique properties make it an effective mechanism for self-transformation, coping and healing. Findings suggest that tattoo, directly tapping into the brain/mind/body continuum of trauma, acts as a mechanism to gain access to --- and retranslate --- stressful and/or traumatic events, initiating healing and recovery. This suggests that tattoo offers a powerful tool to not only affect personal transformation, but to challenge dominant social systems of meaning.",,,
1165,Molecular Beam Epitaxy Growth of Rare Earth Elements in III-V Semiconductors for Thermoelectrics,"Over half of the energy from non-sustainable sources such as coal, natural gas, and petroleum that is converted for electricity and transportation is lost as waste heat. In 2012 alone, the U.S. rejected _58.1 quadrillion BTUs as unusable energy everywhere from power plants to automobile exhaust pipes to laptop CPUs. Thermoelectric materials, which convert heat into electricity within a solid-state device, offer a viable technology to capture some of this widely-spread waste heat and convert it directly into usable electricity. Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) provides a means to explore new ideas through fine control of doping and heterostructures, and opens the door to new nanostructures accessed only in a kinetically-limited growth regime. ErAs:InGaAlAs nanocomposites grown by MBE have previously shown a high thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT_1.33 at 800 K, which make them promising for thermoelectric applications. But those results have raised several key questions: why does an isovalent atom like Er cause n-type conductivity in InGa(Al)As, and would other rare earth elements or other III-V semiconductors be even better suited for thermoelectric applications? Beyond rare earth doping, are there new and better heterojunction engineering schemes to improve a variety of thermoelectric composites? Working with researchers in Arthur C. Gossard and John E. Bower's groups, ErAs semimetal nanoparticle - InGaAs semiconductor composites were optimized and measured, yielding a ZT of _1.7 at 850 K. A solubility limit of Er in InGaAs was identified, and along with researchers in Chris G. Van de Walle's group, it was shown that Er, which is isovalent with In and Ga, is a n-type dopant when positioned on an interstitial crystallographic site. Furthermore, it was found that the position of Er atoms and formation of ErAs particles can be controlled in the kinetically-limited growth regime by changing growth temperature and growth rate. Hong Lu and I explored other rare earth elements, such as Ce, Sm, Yb, and Eu and other semiconductors, such as InGa(Al)Sb and InAsSb, offering a wide range of thermal and electrical properties. ErSb:InGaSb was shown to have improved p-type thermoelectric properties, and independent control of electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity was demonstrated by codoping Ce and Si in InGaAs. Additionally and unrelated to rare earth doping, John E. Bowers and I conceived and demonstrated a new strategy for improving Seebeck coefficient using heterojunctions.",,,
1166,Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Retinal Circuitry Development,"The retina is a sensory structure of the central nervous system that initiates the perception of vision. Due to its highly organized and laminar structure, and its well-defined connectivity patterns, the retina provides an ideal model to elucidate the mechanisms of neural circuit formation. Additionally, study of the mouse retina across genetically dissimilar strains facilitates the identification of genes necessary for its development. In this dissertation, three features of neural circuits will be examined in the mouse retina in order to determine the mechanisms underlying their establishment. First, the genetic control of neuronal population size will be determined for three retinal neurons that participate in the same microcircuit, and the degree to which they are co-regulated will be assessed. Second, the plasticity of neuronal differentiation will be determined for neurons of the outer retina by manipulating the composition of cells in the local environment. Finally, a molecular requirement for the assembly of neural mosaics will be identified for one type of retinal neuron. Through these analyses we will gain insight into how the complexity of nervous system arises, which is relevant for the advancement of genetic and cellular therapies.",,,
1167,Effects of density on behaviorally-mediated tradeoffs between growth and survivorship,"The influence of density-dependent and number-dependent processes on individual demographic rates often results in ecological tradeoffs. Because such processes have important implications for individual level fitness and population regulation, they long have been an important topic in ecological research. I used Dascyllus trimaculatus, a site-attached planktivorous coral reef fish, to determine independently the effects of population density and group size on rates of individual growth and mortality. Somatic growth of D. trimaculatus was positively related to the density of D. trimaculatus outplanted to their host anenomes, Heteractis magnifica, with nearly twice as much growth observed in individuals living in the highest density treatment. By contrast, survivorship of D. trimaculatus on H. magnifica exhibited a negative relationship with density. There was no significant effect of group size on either the growth or mortality rates of D. trimaculatus . These relationships suggest a tradeoff between density-dependent growth and survival in this species. My analysis of behavioral data indicated that D. trimaculatus living under conditions of higher local population densities displayed decreased rates of intraspecific aggression because of positive feedback between local population density and the foraging distance from an individual's host anemone. In turn, lower rates of aggression and feeding higher in the water column resulted in increased somatic growth rates due to: (1) a reduced energy expenditure and (2) an increase in prey consumption.",,,
1168,Naturalism and Libertinism in Seventeenth-Century Italian Painting,"The work of Caravaggio, which was recognized as revolutionary in his own time and exerted a profound influence on seventeenth century painting all over Europe, has prompted a wide range of interpretations among modern art historians. Some, emphasizing the controversy generated by his religious pictures, have seen him as a daringly irreverent artist, while others have found his unidealized ""naturalistic"" style fundamentally well-suited to the spirit of the Catholic Counter-Reformation. Some detect a boldly overt homoeroticism in many of his pictures, while others claim not to see it at all. Some understand him to have worked in an unprecedentedly direct, almost visceral way, while others emphasize his sympathy with new directions in the sciences or the intellectual sophistication with which he played his naturalistic style against the precedents of classical and earlier Renaissance art. Caravaggio's difficult personality has also lent itself to different readings. Some see him as a sociopath, if not a psychopath, while others see him calculatedly performing the role of social rebel in a manner that looks forward to the self-consciously dissident posturings of modern artists. Some art-historians have been led to conclude that he had highly-developed non-conformist values and tendencies that could be described as ""libertine"" in at least some of the varied senses in which that word was used during his time. The aim of this dissertation is to discuss the relation of Caravaggio's work and personal example to his immediate art-historical and cultural context, but also to trace their influence on an ever-more-disparate group of artists active in the seventeenth century in order to see whether his style, sometimes characterized as ""Baroque Naturalism,"" actually implied a set of values beyond its efficacy as an artistic strategy, whether a commitment to it implied or was understood to imply a non-conformist or libertine orientation that might be a matter of deep conviction on the part of the artist or a position felt to be appropriate to certain themes or in certain contexts. The first chapter examines Caravaggio himself, while the second discusses three artists---Giovanni Baglione, Orazio Gentileschi, and Guido Reni---who knew him personally and responded to his work as it burst so dramatically on the scene in the very first years of the century. The third chapter discussed three artists who were active shortly afterward, whose engagement with Caravaggio testifies to a wider field of influence: Valentin de Boulogne, Domenico Fetti, and Guido Cagnacci. The final chapter sets two very different artists---Salvator Rosa and Nicolas Poussin---side by side in order to expose both the radically different responses to Caravaggio's legacy and the diverse senses in which the word ""libertine"" must be understood. While the evidence does seem to suggest that at least some artists utilized Caravaggesque naturalism in order to invoke a well-defined ""alternative tradition,"" one that was understood to imply a certain range of values, very few committed themselves to his approach strictly or for very long. Poussin rejected it emphatically. Yet Poussin, too, deliberately positioned himself on the margins of the Roman art world in order to cultivate a distinctive approach to art, one that seems to have been consciously based on deeply-held philosophical convictions. The lesson seems to be that Caravaggio's example made it possible for later artists to develop strategies with which to express their dissent from the prevailing values and practices of their time, and that even if their work did not look like his, they were indebted to him.",,,
1169,An analogue of lebesgue decomposition for finite measures with respect to bessel capacity,"Let Omega be an open ball in R. N and B the sigma-algebra of Borel setson Omega. The Lebesgue decomposition theorem states that if mu is a finite measure on (Omega, B), then there exists a finite measure mu_1 which is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure lambda. N and a finite measuremu_2 which is singular with respect to lambda. N such that mu = mu_1 + mu_2,and mu_1 and mu_2 are unique. Moreover, the Radon-Nikodym theorem states that there exists a function f in L. 1(Omega) such that mu_1(E) = int_E f dx. For a real number p greater than 1, we define a set function cap_p( . , Omega) on B that is countably subadditive. We present a proof of a statement very similar to the classical Lebesgue decomposition, namely an arbitrary finite measure mu on (Omega, B) is uniquely decomposed into a finite measure mu_1. *which is absolutely continuous with respect to cap_p( . , Omega) and a finite measure mu_2 which is singular with respect to cap_p( . , Omega). We then present a proof of a statement very similar to the Radon-Nikodym theorem regarding mu_1. *, namely mu_1. * is decomposed into a finite signed measure mu_0 whichbelongs to L. 1(Omega) and a finite signed measure mu_1 which belongs to theSobolev dual space (W. {1,p}(Omega)). *, so that mu = mu_0 + mu_1 + mu_2.",,,
1170,Non-suicidal self-injury among European-American and Latino/a-American inpatient adolescents,"Although there has been an increase in research on non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) there continues to be a need to explore this phenomenon in light of evidence that this behavior is increasing rapidly among adolescent populations. Multiple formulations exist that have gained research support for the onset and maintenance of NSSI; impulsivity, addictive behavior, alexithymia and dissociative symptoms, maladaptive social/interpersonal relationships, personality pathology, and affect regulation. This study examined the affect regulation model proposed by Suyemoto (1998) in a sample (N = 175) of inpatient adolescents using an objective, self-report assessment instrument (PAI-A). This study also examined potential differences between European-American and Latino/a-American participants to test whether the affect regulation model is a useful cross-cultural explanation for NSSI within this sample. Mutivariate analysis revealed no group differences related to ethnicity but participants within the self-injuring group scored significantly lower on the PAI-A subscales that measure aggression with self-injurers scoring lower than their non-injuring counterparts on aggressive attitude, and physical aggression. Results suggest that adolescent inpatient self-injurers may attempt to regulate anger/hostility/aggression by employing self-harm as a maladaptive coping strategy. Results were consistent with previous research studies investigating functions of intentional self-harm.",,,
1171,"I. Green Chemistry and Metathesis II. Copper Hydride 1,2- and 1,4-Reductions of Enones","As the chemical industry is becoming more conscious about the amount of hazardous waste they are generating, green chemistry and its underlying principles are becoming more relevant. One approach that can be taken to eliminate unnecessary waste would be to remove organic solvents from organic reactions. A second approach would be to use catalysis whenever possible. Research into both of these approaches is the focus of this thesis. Nonionic surfactants in water, namely the vitamin E based amphiphiles (PTS and the newly developed TPGS-750-M), have played important roles in enabling these two approaches. Numerous transition metal catalyzed transformations can now be accomplished in water at room temperature. The Lipshutz group's chemistry in water is an important advance in surfactant technology evidenced by its recent award of the EPA's Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award. This thesis will detail both cross- and ring-closing metathesis, Miyaura borylations, copper hydride-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate reductions, and copper(I)/TEMPO catalyzed oxidations. The copper hydride-catalyzed conjugate reduction has become a valuable and reliable method for generating a stereocenter beta to what was an beta,beta-unsaturated system. The method is mild, and in general, selective. Curiously, when alpha-substituted or acyclic beta,beta-disubstituted enones are subjected to the reduction conditions created when nonracemic DTBM-SEGPHOS is employed; reduction of the ketone, rather than the enone takes place. The newly formed alcohols are generated in high enantiomeric excesses. A mechanistic investigation was pursued using computational chemistry.",,,
1172,Ultra-Low Voltage Wide Bandwidth Substrate Removed III-V Electro-optic Modulators,"We live in times with ever increasing demand for data. The only technology that can deliver required bandwidths is optical fiber communications. A key component of this technology is the external modulator which provides electrical to optical conversion. There are several requirements for optical modulators and among those drive voltage and electrical bandwidth are two key qualifiers. Drive voltage and electrical bandwidth are desired to be as low and as wide as possible respectively to reduce the power consumption, to eliminate modulator driver and take advantage of the ultra-wide bandwidths offered by fiber optics. Such optical modulators are also used in other applications, such as microwave photonics, instrumentation and optical signal processing. In this dissertation, novel electro-optic modulators in compound semiconductor epilayers using substrate removal techniques are reported. Submicron epilayers removed from their substrates contain buried electrodes made out of doped semiconductors. In this study three important contributions were made to the state of the art of ultra-low voltage modulators. First, a modulator was fabricated out of an epilayer consists of a p-i-n junction in which i layer is composed of an InGaAlAs/InAlAs MQW. Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulators fabricated using this approach had 0.2 V (0.6 V) V pi for 3 (1) mm long electrodes at 1.55 mum under push pull drive corresponding to record modulation efficiency of 0.06 V-cm. Second, electrode capacitance and resistance were reduced significantly using staircase waveguides and n-i-p-i-n epilayer designs. 0.8 V drive voltage for a 4.5 mm long electrode which corresponds to 0.36 V-cm modulation efficiency was obtained. Third, traveling wave electrodes suitable for wide bandwidth and low voltage operation were designed using loaded line approach. A very accurate modeling of the electrode was introduced. Such electrodes were fabricated and characterized up to 35 GHz. Theoretical and experimental results indicate that sub volt modulators with electrical to optical bandwidths in excess of 35 GHz are possible. This is the first demonstration of wide bandwidth operation of ultra-low voltage modulators. Furthermore optical scattering loss of waveguides appropriate for ultra-low voltage modulators was reduced to 2 dB/cm and insertion loss was improved 7 dB using novel mode converters.",,,
1173,"The Vanguards of Islamism: Origins, Histories, and Ideologies of the Society of Muslim Brothers in Egypt","The pivotal role Islamism will play in the post-Arab Spring global dynamic drives this thesis. It analyses the various origins and ideologies of the most seminal Islamist movement, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. As Egypt serves as the socio-political fulcrum of the Middle East North Africa region, so too stands the Muslim Brotherhood as the logical genesis for a discussion about the larger phenomenon of Islamism. My thesis argues that the Brotherhood specifically, and Islamism generally, offers far more flexibility in ideology than the West frequently concedes. Its development proves non-linear, complex and frequently interrupted by bifurcation; the ideologies it produced and still produces are therefore polymorphic, ranging from moderate and conciliatory to belligerent and radical. Which, if any, Islamism prevails in the Middle East will depend on the abilities of the various movements' leaders to offer beneficial alternatives to the decades of tyranny the masses rejected in the Arab Spring. I argue that by returning to the ideology of the Brotherhood's founding father, Hassan al-Banna, a moderate, conciliatory, and above all flexible interpretation of Islamism may be found. This requires a reconsideration of the radicalism that has spiraled out of the ranks of the Brotherhood, specifically acknowledging Sayyid Qutb's writings as aberrations of al Banna's message, rather than as natural evolutions. I conclude that Islamism and radical Islamism must be separated in academic and political discourse, treated as related but separate phenomena, in order to push the quotidial dialogue in a mutually generative direction. To do this, I first trace the historical trajectory of the Brotherhood, highlighting incidences of flexibility and cooperative methods of the movement to insure its survival through the tumultuous post-Colonial era. The second section highlights the Brotherhood's oscillations between radical and moderate ideological positions. My analysis demonstrates that the Muslim Brotherhood has a long history of pragmatic response to changing political situations. The West too often views the Muslim Brotherhood through the ""Clash of Civilization"" narrative -- in which the Muslim Brotherhood is one continuous, fixed entity in opposition to the West -- rather than acknowledging the bifurcated and malleable identity of the organization.",,,
1174,I'm not a bad person: How mentoring programs help justice-involved and high-risk youth develop new identities,"This study explores 1) how participation in a cognitive-based mentoring program helps justice-involved and high-risk youth develop new sense of selves and 2) the challenges youth face as they develop these new identities in their home neighborhoods. Findings from surveys and semi-structured interviews highlight youths' experiences in the mentoring program. The cognitive-based mentoring program is a safe space for young people to interact with their peers and role models with a similar background in the criminal justice system. Once their weekly two-hour group meeting ends, all of the youth return home to neighborhoods where violence is prevalent. Accounts from young people reveal how they reconcile their newly developing sense of selves with their street identities as they navigate their neighborhoods. Young people's accounts reveal a sense of agency, but also highlight how structural conditions complicate justice-involved and high-risk youth's efforts to change. The implications of this study for at-risk youth and mentoring programs are also discussed.",,,
1175,Three Essays on Labor Markets,"This dissertation consists of three distinct papers. The first chapter estimates the labor market value of being bilingual (English-speaking) in Mexico. The second chapter studies employers' ex ante discriminatory practices in China and Mexico. Finally, the third chapter estimates a compensating differential for fatality risk for workers in Mexico. An abstract for each chapter is provided below. Chapter 1 Abstract: In spite of the generally accepted status of English as a lingua franca, the labor market returns to English for its role as an international language are understudied. In this paper I use advertisements from Computrabajo.com.mx to estimate the returns to English in Mexico. I find that the wage premium for English speakers is approximately 28 percent for the sample as a whole. The evidence suggests that English may provide a path to upward economic mobility in Mexico, and that this holds true for persons of all skill levels. Chapter 2 Abstract: When permitted by law and custom, employers sometimes engage in ex ante screening of job candidates using demographic criteria like age and gender. We study this practice using four samples of job ads, taken from job boards in China and Mexico. Consistent with Kuhn and Shen's (2013) screening cost model, we find a strong, negative skill-targeting relationship in all four data sets: employers are less likely to express an explicit age or gender preference in a job ad as the job's skill requirements rise. We also find that employers' age and gender preferences interact in a strong and consistent way across all four data sets: relative to women, men's (revealed) desirability as workers rises dramatically between the ages of 18 and 40. While some of this pattern can be linked to an age-dependent demand for feminine beauty and to gender differences in firms' marital status preferences, other aspects of the pattern are harder to explain. Chapter 3 Abstract: The escalation in violence in recent years resulting from the Mexican government's war on drug trafficking has caused a large and unprecedented increase in workplace fatality risk for workers in Mexico. We exploit this increase to estimate a compensating differential for fatality risk using panel data constructed from a national employment and occupation survey. We also provide estimates of the value of a statistical life (VSL) in Mexico. Our results imply a VSL between $160,000 and $350,000 U.S dollars for a nationally representative sample of Mexican workers. This is well below the range of estimates typically found in developed countries, which is consistent with the notion that health and safety are normal goods.",,,
1176,An investigation of the neural substrates underlying the anxiogenic effects of cocaine,"Cocaine self-administration is known to produce both positive/euphoric and negative/anxiogenic effects. While the rewarding effects of cocaine have been well documented, the neurobiology underlying its anxiogenic effects remains unclear. Our laboratory has employed two behavioral assays to study these opposing actions of cocaine: a runway self-administration test, and a modified place conditioning test. In the runway, the positive and negative effects of cocaine are reflected in the frequency of approach-avoidance conflict behavior that animals develop about entering a goal box associated with cocaine delivery. In the place conditioning test, animals develop preferences for environments paired with the immediate/rewarding effects of cocaine but avoid environments paired with the drug's delayed/anxiogenic actions. The investigations detailed in this dissertation utilize both of these behavioral models in an attempt to understand the neurobiology underlying the negative/anxiogenic effects of cocaine. Four studies were designed and executed to address three broad aims: (1) to determine if the reward-related neurotransmitter dopamine plays a role in cocaine's negative effects, (2) to identify specific brain regions critical to the experience of cocaine's anxiogenic properties, and (3) to examine the role of neurotransmitter systems within identified structures in these properties. Altogether, the experiments detailed in this thesis do not support a role for dopamine in cocaine's anxiogenic effects, but, rather, outline a role for norepinephrine neurotransmission within the extended amygdala in the delayed/negative effects of cocaine administration.",,,
1177,Decoding human sensorimotor transformations for goal-directed movement,"Neurophysiology and neuroimaging evidence suggests that the brain represents multiple environmental and body-related features in order to compute transformations from sensory input to motor output. However, it is unclear how these features interact to facilitate the necessary sensorimotor transformations. To investigate this issue, we examined the representations of sensory and motor features of hand movements within the left-hemisphere motor network. In a rapid event- related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design, we measured blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) brain activity as participants performed right-handed movements at the wrist, with either of two postures and two amplitudes, to move a cursor to targets at different locations. Using a multi-voxel analysis technique with rigorous generalization tests, we reliably distinguished the representations of task-related features (primarily target location, movement direction, and posture) in multiple regions. Generalization tests also identified two interactions: One interaction was between the decoding of target location and movement direction in the superior parietal lobule, which may underlie a transformation from the location of the target in space to movement vector. Additionally, there was an interaction between movement direction and posture in primary motor, premotor, and parietal regions--a requisite step in combining extrinsic and intrinsically organized information. Together, these results reveal the complex interactions between different sensory and motor features that drive the computation of sensorimotor transformations.",,,
1178,Correlating long-range order and local structure to the properties of inorganic solids,"Relating the structures and compositions of inorganic materials to their function is at the core of rational design of new materials. Dopant ions are responsible for function in many inorganic materials, such as zeolites for catalysis, phosphor materials, semiconductors, solar materials, and thermoelectrics. Understanding the distribution, local structure, and local compositions around dopant ions is crucial for rational design of new and improved materials. Here, the focus will be on phosphor materials, but the methodology is applicable to the other materials mentioned. The advent of bright-blue LEDs in the mid-1990s following the developmentby Nakamura and others of (In,Ga)N devices was a landmark achievement in solid state lighting. The availability of bright radiation at the high-energy end of the visible spectrum provided a simple and cost-effective means of generating white light by the process of using phosphors to partially down-convert some of the blue emission to longer wavelengths corresponding to colors such as green, yellow, and red. This results in lighting devices that offer greater efficiency, significantly longer working lives, and a complete absence of toxic elements in their constituent parts. Phosphor compounds are an integral part of the white solid-state lighting design, since currently no efficient green and yellow LEDs exist. Although many phosphor compounds have been discovered and used in the past, they have been discovered empirically using basic solid-state chemistry intuition. New phosphors with greater amounts of red emission and high quantum efficiencies up to 500 K are highly sought after, yet no rational design rules for finding new phosphors have been proposed. Here, the structure-composition-property relations of many phosphor compounds are investigated, including the well-known phosphor Y3-xCexAl 5O12 (YAG:Ce3+), a new nitride phosphor La 3-xCexSi 6N11 (LSN:Ce3+), the phosphor Ca1- xCexSc2O4 (CSO:Ce3+), and the oxyfluoride solid-solution phosphor Sr 2:975Ce0:025Al1-xSi xO4+xF1- x (SASF:Ce3+). Using a combination of powerful experimental methods, the structural properties of these phosphors, including the nature of the Ce3+ local environments, are determined and are correlated with the macroscopic luminescent properties of the Ce-substituted phosphors. From this, design rules for rational discovery of new phosphors are presented.",,,
1179,"The queer flneur abroad : global itinerancy, cognitive mapping, and the spatial construction of queer subjectivity in four british novelists, 1886-1988","Situated at the intersection of Modernist studies, queer history, and 20th century Anglophone literature, ""The Queer Flaneur Abroad"" explores the historical and cultural contexts surrounding four queer male British novelists in order to interrogate the function of global travel and queer spaces in the formation of contemporary queer male subjectivity. Beginning with the Victorian fin de siecle and the aftermath of the Wilde trial, it examines the works and lives of Fredrick Rolfe (Baron Corvo) and E.M. Forster to argue that travel and exile in the Mediterranean and Global South afforded early 20th century queer male novelists the opportunity to pursue erotic activity in a context freed from the rigid mores of British society, while simultaneously providing, in Hellenism and classicism, the opportunity to cloak their desires in legitimating discourses and produce cultural texts whose circulation established and nurtured a burgeoning transnational community of queer men. At the same time, as demonstrated both in Forster's A Room with a View and in his biographical experience in Alexandria, modern formations of public space were creating new sites for cross-class, -race, and -cultural contacts in the imperial metropolis. As the century progressed, the role of travel and queer space shifted. In his 1962 novel Down There on a Visit Christopher Isherwood pays homage to travel as a mode of sexual exploration and self-discovery while ultimately dismissing it in favor of the radical subjective and political potential inherent in desiring queer relationships and their power to forge communal belonging. The project closes with an analysis of Alan Hollinghurst's 1988 novel The Swimming-Pool Library, in which through the exploration of queer spaces such as the gym, the night club, and others, Hollinghurst takes a backward glance at the 20th century forces of homophobia and colonialism that conspired together to produce a present in which queer men of all colors, social backgrounds and nationalities might come together in queer spaces to counter their distinctive and shared histories of oppression. Ultimately, the arc traced by the spaces formulating 20th century queer male subjectivity delineates that subject traveling, over a century, from pathologized isolation toward communal belonging.",,,
1180,Surface Engineering of Nickel Alloys to Form a Stable Alpha Alumina Barrier Layer at Temperatures Less Than or Equal to 1000 Degrees Celsius,"Alloy 617, a candidate material for the intermediate heat exchanger in the helium-cooled very high temperature reactor (VHTR), is susceptible to carburization, decarburization, and/or oxidation by impurities (H 2/H2O, CO/CO2, CH4, etc) in the He coolant, with deleterious effects on its structural integrity. The chromia scale formed naturally by this alloy does not provide adequate protection at the target operating temperatures, 950+/-50C. Alpha alumina, which has been proven as an effective diffusion barrier to protect nickel alloys in extreme environments such as gas turbine engines, is attractive as an environmental barrier for 617. To assure that this phase forms (rather than less protective metastable structures) in the low pO2 environment at 800C_T_1000C, surface modification is required. Lifetime requirements demand stability of the modified surface layers against interdiffusion with the substrate, and the ability of the oxide to re-form in the event of cracking or spallation due to thermo-mechanical stresses in the prospective applications. To provide an aluminium reservoir and enable the formation of alumina, alloy 617 was aluminized by pack cementation. NiAl formed on further heating as well as carbide and sigma interlayers that were found to control the diffusion behavior between the coating and substrate. Because NiAl coatings are known to form persistent transient aluminas at T_1000C, FeCrAlY, which readily form alpha alumina under the same conditions, was also explored as an outer layer on 617. Although cladding 617 directly with FeCrAlY resulted in extensive interdiffusion, cladding 617 that had previously been aluminized produced a more stable microstructure. While the interlayers formed by aluminizing limited diffusion in the multilayer system, there was still diffusion of nickel into FeCrAlY that resulted in the formation of ordered B2 (beta') precipitates in the disordered, solid solution bcc (beta) FeCrAlY layer. The beta/beta' microstructure resembles the gamma/gamma' microstructure of some nickel superalloys and could enhance the mechanical properties of the coating. However, continued nickel diffusion caused the formation of a solid solution fcc (gamma) layer at the expense of the beta/beta' microstructure, indicating further improvements to the stability are necessary. Oxidation in low pO2 environments promoted the formation of alpha alumina over transient aluminas for both coatings. However, the clad + aluminized coatings more readily developed an alpha alumina scale, a difference that became more pronounced at lower oxidation temperatures. Samples for evaluation in impure He environments were pre-oxidized in a low pO2 environment prior to exposure to form a thin alpha alumina scale. Exposures were carried out in flowing He environments with carefully controlled CO:CO2 ratios of _9 (decarburizing) and _1272 (carburizing). The alpha alumina scale formed on pre-oxidation was an effective barrier to carburization/decarburization in both aluminized and aluminized + clad samples.",,,
1181,Prenatal glucocorticoid stimulation and reduced function of the adult neurogenic system: Implications for vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders,"Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous chronic and debilitating disorder that affects approximately 24 million individuals worldwide. Current treatments for schizophrenia are characterized by only moderate success and relatively high side effect profiles. Accordingly, investigations of the underlying neurobiology of the disorder are essential. This dissertation reviews the evidence for a link between an early environmental disruption, prenatal stress (PNS), and an increased likelihood of developing schizophrenia in PNS offspring. Further, it reviews a biological outcome of PNS, impairment of the adult neurogenic system. Evidence in support of a link between impairment of the adult neurogenic system and schizophrenia is also reviewed. Given that alteration to the adult neurogenic system appears to be a converging factor between PNS and in schizophrenia, it is hypothesized that this system is a critical mediatior of the disproportionate occurrence of schizophrenia in PNS offspring. Presented here are empirical studies which clarify the functional link between glucocorticoid hormones released during PNS, the adult neurogenic system, and schizophrenia. The broad aims were to determine whether: 1) Glucocorticoid stress hormones mediate PNS induced impairment of the adult neurogenic system and some PNS induced behavioral deficits, 2) Ablation of the adult neurogenic system alters behaviors on tests relevant to partial animal models of psychoses, and 3) Ablation of the neurogenic system leads to an increased susceptibility to the effects of stress in these behavioral measures. These studies found that prenatal glucocorticoid administration is sufficient to impair the adult neurogenic system and alter behaviors relevant to some partial animal models of psychoses. Further, it was found that selective ablation of the adult neurogenic system leads to increased behavioral despair in the Porsolt swim test but does not alter behavior on other tests relevant to partial animal models of psychoses chosen for these experiments. Further, it was found that stress exposure does not interact with ablation of the adult neurogenic system to potentiate the increase in behavioral despair following ablation alone, or lead to alterations in any of the other behavioral measures employed. Finally, the use of selective ablation of the adult neurogenic system as a potential animal model of the positive, negative, sensorimotor gating, and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia is discussed in the context of the present findings and current literature.",,,
1182,Asceticism and the Affirmation of the World,"While the practice of asceticism has been widely understood as a world-rejecting phenomenon by philosophers and scholars of religion, recent theorists of asceticism have attempted to refocus on asceticism's affirmative dimensions. I argue that these attempts to explore the affirmative nature of asceticism have lacked full engagement with Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical reflection upon asceticism's world-negating and world-affirming possibilities. By exploring Nietzsche's critique of and approbation of asceticism, I find resources for identifying two broad trajectories according to which ascetic practices can be organized. In the first, asceticism is explicitly engaged by the practitioner with the purpose of achieving a self-mastery that allows the practitioner to wield power over others, the world, and/or the practitioner's fate. In attempting to wield this control over the world, I argue that the ascetic inherently devalues it. In the second trajectory, the adherent's ascetic exercises are aimed at mastering the self in such a way as to resist the impulse to master the world, thus allowing the practitioner to affirm the world ""as it is."". In making this distinction, I develop a new theory of asceticism by both drawing from and critiquing the theoretical contributions of Max Weber and Michel Foucault, as well as those of more recent theorists including Geoffrey Harpham and Gavin Flood. In revealing the ascetic underpinnings of Nietzsche's philosophy, I demonstrate the ways in which the concerns of this bitter critic of Christianity resonate deeply with certain strains of Christian ascetic and mystical theology. Thus, I explore the ways in which Christian asceticism can aim in a world-affirming direction akin to that which Nietzsche endorses. To this end, I examine asceticism's role in Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov and the films of Terrence Malick, and I elucidate how these two artists depict both the world-denying and world-affirming potential of Christian asceticism. In the conclusion, I explore the applicability of my theory to the study of Islamic asceticism, and, by extension, the study of other manifestations of religious and philosophical asceticism.",,,
1183,Ultra-Low Loss Waveguides with Application to Photonic Integrated Circuits,"The integration of photonic components using a planar platform promises advantages in cost, size, weight, and power consumption for optoelectronic systems. Yet, the typical propagation loss of 5-10 dB/m in a planar silica waveguide is nearly five orders-of-magnitude larger than that in low loss optical fibers. For some applications, the miniaturization of the photonic system and resulting smaller propagation lengths from integration are enough to overcome the increase in propagation loss. For other more demanding systems or applications, such as those requiring long optical time delays or high-quality-factor (Q factor) resonators, the high propagation loss can degrade system performance to a degree that trumps the potential advantages offered by integration. Thus, the reduction of planar waveguide propagation loss in a Si3-N4 based waveguide platform is a primary focus of this dissertation. The ultra-low loss stoichiometric Si3-N4 waveguide platform offers the additional advantages of fabrication process stability and repeatability. Yet, active devices such as lasers, amplifiers, and photodetectors have not been monolithically integrated with ultra-low loss waveguides due to the incompatibility of the active and ultra-low loss processing thermal budgets (ultra-low loss waveguides are annealed at temperatures exceeding 1000 C in order to drive out impurities). So a platform that enables the integration of active devices with the ultra-low losses of the Si3- N4 waveguide platform is this dissertation's second focus. The work enables the future fabrication of sensor, gyroscope, true time delay, and low phase noise oscillator photonic integrated circuits.",,,
1184,Gallium nitride vertical electron transistors for high power applications,"Lateral GaN HEMT structures have been well studied and developed for high power applications. However, for very high breakdown voltages, a vertical device design is more favorable owing to better field distribution and higher power density. Current Aperture Vertical Electron Transistors (CAVETs) benefit from the high electron mobility of the 2-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG) in the lateral direction and better field distribution in the vertical direction. Current flows laterally in the 2-DEG at the AlGaN/GaN heterojunction and is directed vertically down to the drain through an aperture. A current blocking layer (CBL) is used to define the low resistance aperture. The focus of this thesis is developing CAVETS with Mg-doped conductive p-GaN layers as the current blocking layer. Current blocking is realized by the use of a reverse biased p-n junction as opposed to an insulating layer. The p-GaN is regrown either by Ammonia MBE or MOCVD and in order to ensure that the p-GaN layer remains active, the channel regrowth is done by Ammonia-MBE. The current blocking capacity of the p-n junction has been verified in an n/p/n structure and the highest breakdown voltage recorded was 870 V. The peak electric field has been estimated to be 3.1 MV/cm, which is close to the GaN critical field. With the current blocking capacity of the active p GaN layer verified, selective area regrowth was used to define the apertures and CAVETs were fabricated. Promising transistor performance was demonstrated with a high saturation current of 10.9 kA cm-2 and low ON-resistance of 0.4 mohm cm 2.",,,
1185,Designing reliable networks-on-chip at the end of traditional cmos scaling,"Traditional CMOS scaling trends, which allowed designers to exploit the increasing number of transistors at almost constant power consumption, are no longer possible. All the recent trends in CPU designs share one common trend, which is departing from the monolithic design of the processor to a more of integrated chip of many components. These components are cores, accelerators, neural-processing units, imprecise computational units or even communication components. All of these parts need to communicate to accomplish greater computational tasks. They usually do through a network-on-chip. In this dissertation, we examined at three reliability aspects of networks-on-chip in this post traditional-CMOS scaling era. First, we explored using plasmonic modulators to enhance the reliability of the recently proposed nano-photonic signaling used in networks-on-chips. We characterized the conditions under which hybrid plasmonic/photonic channels would save energy used in tuning the channels. In high assurance systems, of which lack of safety guarantees can be catastrophic or even fatal, non-interference is used to separate critical domains handling critical (or confidential) information from those processing normal (or unclassified) data. We proposed SurfNoC, a provably secure timing-channel free supporting multiple security domains. It is a scheduling technique that guarantees non-interference between domains at a low-latency overhead. We used gate-level information flow tracking to design and verify the security property of the router micro-architecture. The third aspect is deadlock-freedom in hardware circuits on the implementation level. We took an information-flow analysis approach in our investigation due to an insight that all requests and grants of resources are manifested in the signals of the implementation. We used gate-level information flow tracking techniques, which were previously used to only analyze security properties, to verify conditions necessary and sufficient for deadlock detection. Specifically, we applied GLIFT techniques to cyclic dependency detection and non-preemption verification conditions of the deadlock. This technique constitutes the first step towards proving deadlock freedom on the implementation level by augmenting it with state-space exploration techniques.",,,
1186,Understanding and Controlling the Interactions of Photo-Responsive Species within Nanostructured Inorganic-Organic Composite Materials,"Photo-responsive species are capable of absorbing light to achieve versatile functionalities that make them of interest in a wide range of applications, including photovoltaics, selective ion transport, sensors, and lasers. For device integration, it is generally beneficial to incorporate these photo-responsive species within robust host matrices such as nanostructured inorganic-organic nanostructured composite materials. Such nanocomposites have high internal surface areas (500--1000 m2/g), large pore or channel volumes (> 1 cm3/g), adjustable compositions, high degrees of periodic ordering with uniform and controllable channel dimensions (3--12 nm), and high thermal, chemical, and mechanical stabilities. For example, in hybrid photovoltaic materials, molecular contact between a photo-responsive, electron-donating conjugated polymer and an electron-accepting titania matrix can be facilitated by co-assembling them into a nanostructured composite. Using solid-state NMR, in combination with other techniques, it has been shown that interactions of the structure-directing surfactant species with the titania matrix, along with chemical structure of the photo-responsive species, strongly influence both the interfacial interactions between the photo-responsive species and the titania network and the device power conversion efficiencies. Similar silica nanostructured composites were also used to incorporate a photo-responsive membrane protein, proteorhodopsin, at high concentrations (up to 55 wt%) for applications in selective photo-induced ion transport; furthermore it is shown that this protein remains active and has improved thermal stability in the nanostructured composite. Finally, novel nanostructured composites with high degrees of macroscopic orientational ordering have been synthesized with a variety of photo-responsive species incorporated, and it has been demonstrated that such materials have improved transport properties in photovoltaic devices.",,,
1187,Nation-State or State-Nation? Myths of Nationhood and Support for State Sovereignty in Belarus,"The research question of this thesis is to identify what factors motivate Belarusians' support for state sovereignty from Russia and from the USSR. Four independent variables are worth examining: the type of national identity (civic or ethnic), the link between ethnicity and national identity, economic interests, and attitudes towards nationalist symbols. These variables relate to the modernist, ethnoculturalist, instrumentalist, and constructivist theories of nations. The effect of these variables is tested by using control variables such as region of origin, settlement type, age, gender, religion, and education. The methods used consist in the analysis of secondary sources in order to measure how historical evidence can substantiate the above mentioned variables. Another method is a survey conducted among Belarusians to measure the influence of these variables. Historical evidence indicates that the absence of an historical narrative acceptable to all Belarusians undermined a common identity, and that a civic model of identity favorable to Russia became more accepted than the nationalist identity model based on ethnicity. Evidence also shows that state consolidation reinforced Belarusians' will to wrestle independence from Russia. Survey results in turn indicate a direct relationship between the type of national identity and from which state Belarusians want sovereignty. Civic identity influences support for sovereignty from a political state, like the USSR, while ethnic identity influences support for sovereignty from an ethnic state like Russia. Most of all, attitudes favorable to nationalist symbols emerged as having the most consistent effect on support for sovereignty. While Belarusians do not consider ethnic ancestry as a criterion for nationality they favor an identity model that can be termed ""national-cultural.""",,,
1188,Toward the Effective Management of Data Uncertainty through the Exploitation of Spatial Relationships,"Advances in sensing hardware and personalized computing devices (e.g. smartphones) are not only major drivers behind ""big-data'', but they are also changing the face of computation. Sensors and mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, have made it possible for users to compute on the go. Not only generating vast amounts of data, but also appending a location to each interaction. This shift to mobile computing provides the necessary context to relate `data' to interactions and processes in the physical world like never before. Despite becoming more cost-effective and widely integrated, data collected from many sensors remains noisy. Computing with this data, despite its uncertainty, is a complex, but necessary task in order to provide robust real-world software systems. In this thesis, I introduce novel techniques for managing the problem of data uncertainty based on the idea of exploiting spatial relationships between data objects. I first introduce two different scenarios and show how this idea of spatial similarity can be used to improve the data management process. Both methods provide a more accurate representation of the (uncertain) data in a more efficient manner than current state-of-the-art techniques. Then, I perform a statistical study of several real-world spatial networks, showing how relationships between entities change with distance and other features of the local network structure. By studying the patterns when relationships between objects is observed, I work backward to infer the mechanisms which affect these relationships. The ideas and techniques introduced in this thesis provide a first step toward effectively managing data uncertainty in the new era of mobile computing by exploiting spatial relationships in an efficient manner.",,,
1189,Investigations of the properties of filled elastomers during cyclic deformation using small angle x-ray scattering,"In this work small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and a new reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) technique were used to characterize the evolution of filler structure in silica-filled polydimethylsiloxane and polydimethyldiphenylsiloxane elastomers. Elastomers are soft, brittle, and have poor fatigue properties. The addition of filler particles, usually carbon black or fumed metal oxides, greatly increases the toughness, maximum elongation, tensile strength, stiffness, and fatigue resistance. Small angle x-ray scattering with in situ mechanical testing provides a way to directly measure structural changes during deformation that have proved difficult to measure using traditional microscopy techniques. Traditional analytical techniques as well as a new reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) method were used to provide insight into the nature of the structural changes during deformation. During deformation the filler particles form raft-like structures that are aligned with their long axes perpendicular to the tensile axis. These structures separate in an affine matter with the sample extension ratio until a critical extension ratio is reached that is independent of silica surface treatment. At extensions above the critical extension ratio the rafts maintain the same relative spacing despite an increasing sample extension ratio. Above the critical extension Poisson compression combined with a high bulk modulus appears to breakup and deform the rafts. During unloading from extension ratios above the critical extension ratio the rafts show a less ordered structure and eventually return to their initial structure when completely unloaded. The patterns for the samples with high particle-filler adhesion show that the filler rich regions are disoriented by rotation. On subsequent cycles there is less correlated orientation between filler particles up to the point of previous maximum extension ratio. Above that extension ratio the structure is identical to that of a monotonically deformed sample. This provides a partial explanation for the strain softening phenomena known as the Mullins effect.",,,
1190,Community development: An exploration of its utility as a development approach,"This paper seeks to explore the potential role of community development as a development approach. Recently, a resurgence of the community development method has begged the question- is this method a useful way to improve the situation of the world's poor? I attempt to answer the question by exploring the different ways ""community development"" is defined by non-governmental actors and by actors from large multilateral organizations such as the World Bank. The two main ideas behind community development, ""participation"" and ""development"", often vary in definition depending on the context. I compare and evaluate the goals of community development projects for their positive and negative aspects, in hopes of better understanding the potential role that community development can play in modern development plans. To illustrate the ideas, I utilize examples from my field research in Cochabamba, Bolivia. This paper concludes by arguing that, based on the success that has been achieved by organizations working toward community development, as well as the normative value in attempting this inclusive form, community development can and should have an important place in the future of development discourse.",,,
1191,"Pulp Empire: Comic Books, Culture, and U.S. Foreign Policy, 1941-1955","From the early 1940s to the mid-1950s, millions of uncensored commercial and government-sanctioned American comic books flooded North America, Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Like popular music, modern art, and Hollywood films, comic books worked to define, for both domestic and global audiences, what it meant to be American during the mid-twentieth century. Invested with this power, comic books simultaneously presented American policymakers with an opportunity and a challenge. Inexpensive, portable, and comprehensible to a diverse readership, comic books provided government agencies with an excellent delivery system for propaganda. At home and abroad, they enabled American officials to mobilize support for a full-scale war against fascism and for a subsequent struggle against international communism. But the comic book medium was not easily controlled. Until 1954, commercial American comic books were not subject to any formal censorship organization. Comic book creators, coarsened by the horrors of World War II, utilized this freedom to produce remarkably violent, racist, and sexual narratives. These unsanctioned, unfettered comic books sold in huge quantities to a global audience, often challenging rather than supporting the state-sanctioned image of the United States. To the dismay of officials, such materials generated powerful anti-American sentiment abroad, seemingly vindicating communist accusations of American depravity. The result was an international anti-comic book campaign, a transatlantic protest against American cultural hegemony. Over the decade following World War II the American government met this challenge through a combination of repression and co-optation. At the local, state, and national levels, policymakers supported an American anti-comic book campaign that unfolded in parallel with the transatlantic effort. In 1954 the domestic campaign succeeded in compelling publishers to accept a censorship code. At the same time, the American government engaged in a policy of co-optation, appropriating the comic book medium in support of Cold War objectives. Domestically, federal agencies used comic books to promote Civil Defense through local organizations and public schools. Internationally, the State Department and the United States Information Agency made extensive use of anti-communist comic book propaganda, particularly in the decolonizing world. These measures transformed comic books into a tamer and more consensual medium.",,,
1192,"The Afterlives of the Vietnam War: Race, Religion, and the Politics of Meaning","The Afterlives of the Vietnam War bridges religious studies, Asian American cultural studies, and Vietnamese American studies, offering the concept of politics of meaning as a theoretical and methodological intervention for understanding the relationships between religion, culture, power, and agency. Here, meaning-making is a contested, political process that reflects the religious dimension of social and cultural life, and Vietnam War cultural memory is a critical site for understanding contemporary modes of meaning in the U.S. This dissertation reveals the religious structure that dominates national meaning-making in the U.S. as racialized American civil religion, and traces the struggles of minorities, particularly Vietnamese Americans, to assert different meanings as a means of survival. At stake here is both a scholarly intervention in how we understand culture and a political intervention in how we understand the human toll of cultural domination. The dissertation examines three cultural sites and asks how each makes meaning as they remember and narrate the Vietnam War. I begin with the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, as a centerpiece of a contemporary racialized American civil religious discourse deploying the languages of ""apolitics"" and ""healing"" that unevenly includes and excludes racial minorities. I then move from ""majority memory"" to ""minority memory"" in two Vietnamese American cultural productions. Ham Tran's film, Journey from the Fall (2007), intervenes in dominant American filmic war memory by centering the refugee nuclear family to define trauma, healing, and Vietnamese peoplehood, while Aimee Phan's story story collection, We Should Never Meet (2004), renarrates the Vietnam War through the marginal figures of mothers and transnational adoptees, to redefine violence and trauma in the context of war, race, and gender. Through these texts, The Afterlives of the Vietnam War outlines the contours of religious, racial, and post-war structures that shape life in the U.S. and the ways Vietnamese Americans draw upon, push against, and exceed those structures, to reveal both the human cost and the human possibilities of that life.",,,
1193,Essays in Voting and Tax Competition,"Chapter I, ""Strategic Voting and Nomination"": Using computer simulations based on three separate data generating processes, I estimate the fraction of elections in which sincere voting will be a core equilibrium given each of eight single-winner voting rules. Additionally, I determine how often each voting rule is vulnerable to simple voting strategies such as 'burying' and 'compromising', and how often each voting rule gives an incentive for non-winning candidates to enter or leave races. I find that Hare is least vulnerable to strategic voting in general, whereas Borda, Coombs, approval, and range are most vulnerable. I find that plurality is most vulnerable to compromising and strategic exit (causing an unusually strong tendency toward two-party systems), and that Borda is most vulnerable to strategic entry. I use analytical proofs to provide further intuition for some of my key results. Chapter II, ""Four Condorcet-Hare Hybrid Methods for Single-Winner Elections"": This essay examines four single-winner election methods, denoted here as Woodall, Benham, Smith-AV, and Tideman, that all make use of both Condorcet's pairwise comparison principle and Hare's elimination and reallocation principle used in the alternative vote. These methods have many significant properties in common, including Smith efficiency and relatively strong resistance to strategic manipulation, though they differ with regard to the minor properties of 'Smith-IIA' and 'mono-add-plump'. Chapter III, ""Individual Location Preferences and Tax Competition Equilibrium"": This paper models revenue-maximizing tax competition between two countries over mobile individuals with exogenous wealth, with an emphasis on examining how the equilibrium taxes are affected by the distribution of individuals' location preferences, and the shape of their utility of consumption function. We find that if the location preference distribution function is continuous and log-concave, a unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium exists. We find also that a more concave utility of consumption function leads to a more progressive tax structure, as richer people are willing to give up more wealth in order to live in their preferred country---in this model, a risk aversion coefficient of one is the boundary between progressivity and regressivity.",,,
1195,Withering Syndrome and the Management of Southern California Abalone Fisheries,"Despite the importance of pathogens in natural populations, little attention has been given to host-pathogen dynamics in fisheries management. Here, I developed a fishery research program and designed a series of experiments and management models to evaluate the consequences of incorporating an explicit consideration of pathogens in the management of southern California abalone fisheries. A controlled, laboratory experiment was conducted testing the influence of environmental variables on key processes of withering syndrome (WS), a fatal disease of California abalones. Daily temperature variability associated with the intertidal environment increased the susceptibility of black abalone to infection, but disease expression occurred only at warm water temperatures and was independent of temperature variability. This result implies that high thermal variation of the marine intertidal zone allows WS to readily infect intertidal black abalone, but infected individuals remain asymptomatic until water temperatures periodically exceed thresholds modulating WS. Intertidal black abalone, but not other abalone species, went extinct locally throughout much of southern California following the emergence of WS, and results suggest that mass mortalities occur before pathogen transmission is limited by density-dependent factors. I analyzed a 30-year data set of abalone abundance at 33 sites in Channel Islands National Park to investigate whether the presence of multiple hosts of WS contributed to the decline of red abalone. The presence of multiple hosts was associated with red abalone declines at the Channel Islands and population declines were pronounced with increasing water temperature. I developed a deterministic, density-dependent host-pathogen model, parameterized by field surveys and laboratory investigations of red abalone life history, to address how the addition of a tolerant host modifies the impact of WS on red abalone. A reservoir host increases the severity of disease-induced population declines, and allows pathogens to overcome density thresholds for transmission, driving focal hosts to near extinction. In the case of red abalone, this will occur when water temperatures are warm and the rate of mortality from WS is high. A management strategy considering host-pathogen dynamics was developed for the California abalone fishery. I show that maximum sustainable yield is attained at a higher fishing effort and lower minimum size limit when disease processes are considered explicitly, and ignoring disease will underestimate potential yield available to the fishery. Including marine reserves as tool for managing diseased populations for harvest had mixed effects. Reserves protected against fishery collapse but increased host population densities within reserves maintained parasite transmission within the fished stock. I concluded by considering the special case where fisheries have prior knowledge of infection status allowing infected hosts to be targeted directly or culled. I found that supplementing harvest by targeting infected hosts directly can increase fishery yield and reduce parasite transmission, even when marine reserves are present. The results highlight how harvest strategies can be modified to consider disease processes explicitly and underscore the value of understanding the indirect consequences of fishing in the integrated management of marine resources.",,,
1196,"Winning the Cause---Handel's Reply to Dryden's Arguments in ""Alexander's Feast"" and ""A Song for St. Cecilia's Day""","John Dryden (1631--1700) and George Frederic Handel (1685--1759) produced literary and musical works that have long been regarded as icons of English culture. Their respective arts merged in the late 1730s when Handel took up two of Dryden's most famous poems, ""Alexander's Feast"" (1736) and ""A Song for St. Cecilia's Day"" (1739) and re-set them to music. This dissertation probes the genesis of Dryden's poems through a survey of the religious and political climate of the seventeenth century. I juxtapose Dryden's possible poetic intents in writing the poems with Handel's response to those intents. After offering an interpretive reading of the poems and the music I consider the evolution and significance of the myth of St. Cecilia as musical patroness in early modern England as well as her influence on both men. I also consider Handel's use of fugue in each work, a compositional tact which allowed him to circumscribe the works as quasi-religious. I argue that Handel understood Dryden's literary stature and used his semi-sacred poems to explore the divide of sacred and secular entertainment in England. My study indicates that Handel approached ""A Song for St. Cecilia's Day"" with a greater degree of compositional caution and diffidence than seen in his setting of ""Alexander's Feast,"" thereby possibly honoring Dryden's wish that music should remain a ""sensible"" art with textual clarity of primary concern. In Alexander's Feast, however, Handel treats the dramatic personae with a sort of inventive wit and pathos that seems lacking in A Song for St. Cecilia's Day. In tracing the evolution and reception of these poems from Dryden's pen to Handel's settings of them, I note how Dryden's words reflect the anxieties of his age regarding the rise of music as an independent entity. Handel's response to this anxiety and the way in which his work was embraced by the English public indicate a major shift in eighteenth-century thought regarding the status of music. Alexander's Feast and A Song for St. Cecilia's Day embody Handel's early creative exploits as he sought, artistically and commercially, to broach the divide of musical entertainment deemed sacred and secular.",,,
1197,Compression and Dispersive Information Routing for Networks,"This dissertation focuses on problems related to compression, routing and communication of correlated sources across a network. The first part of the dissertation derives information theoretic bounds to characterize the performance limits of joint compression-routing systems. The second half addresses practical design issues related to large scale distributed quantization. The results in this dissertation can be grouped into four major categories, each described briefly in the following paragraphs. The first problem is related to minimum cost joint compression and routing of correlated sources across a network. A new routing paradigm, called ""dispersive information routing'' (DIR) is introduced, wherein the intermediate nodes are allowed to split a packet and forward different subsets of the received bits of each of the forward paths. Information theoretic bounds on the minimum cost achievable using DIR are derived and it is demonstrated using simple examples that DIR asymptotically outperforms conventional routing techniques, with the gains growing unboundedly with the network size, for certain networks. Also, a practical design strategy is proposed that results in low-delay dispersive information routers achieving significantly better performance compared to conventional routing techniques. The second problem is concerned with multiple descriptions coding. The problem was originally posed as a method to cope with packet failures in network scenarios where the objective is to design the encoders (for each packet) and decoders (for each packet loss pattern) to achieve the best rate-distortion performance. Two new encoding principles are proposed for the L channel multiple descriptions problem. The first approach involves an encoding strategy called ""combinatorial message sharing'', where a unique common codeword is sent within each subset of the descriptions. For a general class of source-distortion pairs (which includes a Gaussian source under mean squared error), the resulting achievable rate-distortion region strictly improves upon the most well known region for the problem. The second approach is based on an encoding principle called ""subset typicality'' where it is assumed that a subset of the descriptions are never received simultaneously at the decoder. This allows the encoder to maintain joint typicality only within subsets of transmitted codewords and hence leads to a strictly improved achievable region. A closely related problem to dispersive information routing is that of characterizing the common information (CI) of two dependent random variables. Although the information theoretic characterizations of the two most well known definitions of CI can be easily evaluated for random variables with infinite entropy (eg. continuous random variables), the intuition underlying their definitions do not generalize. In this work, single letter information theoretic characterizations of CI are derived for the lossy generalization of the Gray-Wyner network which allows us to extend the intuition underlying their definitions to continuous random variables. Close connections between lossy-CI and the problem of successive refinement are established and a new encoding mechanism is proposed for encoding sources that are not successively refinable. The fourth problem addresses the design of distributed quantizers for large scale sensor networks operating in severe channel conditions. Two major obstacles have posed existential threats to practical deployment of conventional distributed coders in real world sensor networks, namely, the exponential growth in decoder complexity with the network size and transmit rates and the critical requirement of error/erasure resilience given the severe channel conditions in most practical sensor networks. In this work, a unified framework for the design of error/erasure resilient and complexity constrained distributed quantizers is proposed, where the decoder complexity is explicitly controlled during the design. Simulation results indicate substantial gains over other state-of-the-art techniques and provide strong evidence that the approach opens the door to practical deployment of distributed coding in real world sensor networks.",,,
1198,Semi-Parametric Mixed-Effects Models for the Analysis of QT intervals,"Pharmacological studies often involve drug safety issues aimed at testing for a difference between experimental groups where the data are longitudinal in nature. Linear Mixed Effects model (LMM) has been used to analyze this kind of data. Frequently, treatment effect, if present, is not constant over time so that it is important to investigate the trend of a difference between experimental groups. The shape of the trend is usually unknown. Therefore, a more flexible approach is required to model the mean response curve. We use a semi-parametric mixed effects model to test a difference between experimental groups. We derive Bayesian confidence intervals and test statistics for general hypotheses in semi-parametric mixed effects models.",,,
1199,"Low Delay, Low Complexity Multimode Tree Coding and Practical Rate Distortion Bounds for Speech","A low-delay and low-complexity Multimode Tree coder with perceptual pre- and post-weighting and backward pitch prediction for both narrowband and wideband speech is developed. In addition, we develop composite source models for both narrowband and wideband speech, and apply these to classical rate distortion theory. Since classical rate distortion theory is based on MSE distortion, we generate mapping functions by calculating the MSE and PESQ/WPESQ pairs from ADPCM coders. As a result, the performance of a standardized speech codec can be compared with rate distortion bounds based on PESQ/WPESQ distortion. In our experiments, the results show that perceptual pre- and post-weighting filters and backward pitch prediction does improve speech quality without increasing bit rate and delay for voiced speech. Compared with narrowband speech codecs, the worst-case complexity of the Multimode Tree coder is one-third of AMR-NB and one-eighth of G.728, and the delay of the Multimode Tree coder is a quarter of AMR-NB. Compared with wideband standardized speech codecs, the worst-case computational complexity of the Multimode Tree coder is one-third of AMR-WB and the delay of the Multimode Tree coder is half of AMR-WB and one-third of G.722.1. In addition, composite source models for both narrowband and wideband speech are developed. In order to generate the mapping function for MSE and PESQ/WPESQ, we use G.726/G.727 for narrowband speech mapping and generate a wideband ADPCM coder based on G.726 and G.727 for wideband mapping. The rate distortion bounds calculated from composite source models based on MSE distortion are mapped to PESQ/WPESQ distortion by mapping functions. Therefore, the performance of standardized speech codecs is compared with the rate distortion bounds based on PESQ/WPESQ distortion.",,,
1200,Regional Wind Power Development and System Integration; A Model for Optimal Site Selection,"At its current size, the integration of wind power in the United States has had little impact on the reliability and operations of the bulk power system. However, the trend in new installations of generation has gone decidedly to wind power. With state renewable portfolio goals as high as supplying 33% of total energy consumed, the variability and uncertainty of wind power can drastically impact system adequacy and security. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation and regional reliability organizations have developed reliability standards that balancing areas must meet during the day-to-day scheduling and dispatch of generation in meeting load. There has been a great deal of research focused on assessing wind power contributions to system adequacy and predicting the impacts of large installations of wind power on system security. Optimization research has focused on the daily operations of balancing areas to minimize fuel and operating costs while meeting reliability standards, yet little research has tried to apply metrics of reliability in optimizing the selection of wind farm sites. In this thesis, minimizing wind power's impacts on system adequacy and security is accomplished through the optimal selection of wind farms from a geographically diverse pool of potential sites. The main contributions of this thesis are two portions of the optimization model. A new formulation is presented to optimize the aggregate capacity credit of selected wind farm sites using adequacy assessment metrics of Peak Load Carrying Capacity and Loss of Load Expectation reliability standards. Also included is a methodology to minimize the variance of selected sites to reduce the capacity and ramping capabilities required of generation and reserves to maintain reliable system operations. The resulting multi-objective optimization model can be used to generate tradeoff curves between different impacts of wind on hourly, load-following, and regulating timescales. These Pareto optimal tradeoffs will allow planners to assess a range of optimal solutions based upon varying impacts on of system operations. Additionally, extensions to the model are discussed, including the conversion of wind installations and operations to functions of cost, as well as the incorporation of transmission interconnection and the decommissioning of unneeded conventional generators.",,,
1201,Immigrant Youth and Activism: Opportunities for Leadership and Social Change,"Immigrant and undocumented high school students are becoming more active in the struggle for educational and human rights for immigrants. This study examined the social and political activism of a group of undocumented immigrant youth in Southern California as they organized in order to gain access to higher education and advocate for immigration reform. This ethnographic study explored the learning processes and outcomes for immigrant youth as they developed their leadership skills and participated in organizing and activism in their schools and communities. The immigrant youth were part of a community-based youth organization called, Youth United for Immigrant Rights. Youth United students helped their classmates understand the social, political, and economic context of immigrant rights, and participated in marches, rallies, phone banking, and direct actions to inform their peers and community members about issues facing immigrants. Data collection included participant observations of the youth group's weekly organizing meetings as well as semi-structured interviews with 15 youth and 10 previous youth activists over the course of sixteen months. Findings suggest that these immigrant high school students developed critical youth development outcomes through their organizing efforts, particularly related to their development of leadership skills and qualities, their identity as undocumented or immigrant youth, and their understanding of social and political inequities affecting the immigrant community. These processes prepared them to take direct action in their school and community and contributed to their pursuit of a college education.",,,
1202,Developing a Reflexive Framework for Sustainable Development -- The Case of Save Lamu,"The challenge of sustainable development in an emerging Africa is how to negotiate between increasingly complex competing views and interests. This is especially relevant in the face of rising global risks. I use a case study of the ongoing construction of the LAPSSET Corridor megaproject in Kenya to highlight the complexities and intersections of competing interests. I focus on the relationship between the Government of Kenya and a transnational coalition called Save Lamu. I argue that understanding the process of development, which involves reflexivity as a central element, helps us explore the complexities and intersections. Knowing the interests of stakeholders and how they intersect helps point us towards how these interests may be balanced. The result is a precautionary approach to development which leads to sustainable development.",,,
1203,The Evolution of Popular Presidential Communication,"This project attempts to answer the question of how and why popular presidential communication evolved through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Using both case-study and statistical analysis, I challenge many of the prevailing assumptions regarding the rhetorical behavior of early presidents. Further, I show technology and the commercialization and professionalization of journalism drove changes in popular presidential communication. In sum, I find that presidents were political opportunists who took every chance to strengthen their relationship with the public.",,,
1204,The Improperly Dead: Tibetan Rolang as Buddhist Grotesquerie,"Depictions of zombies (ro langs) in Tibetan sources often contradict one another. Some narrative accounts portray them as threats to human life while others describe how zombies can be harnessed as slaves or sources of supernatural power. In many of these accounts it is also unclear whether the zombie is spiritual or corporeal, or if the term refers to an undead demonic entity or the means by which one is turned into the undead, leaving us without a definitive understanding of the rolang. This paper suggests that the rolang may be understood as a liminal figure, existing between fixed categories of good and evil, spirit and flesh, etc. It will also explore the extent to which we might understand the rolang in conjunction with the Western tradition of the literary grotesque.",,,
1205,"Re-Visioning Winslow, Arizona: Experiments in the Historical Study of Place Employing a Variety of Personal and Modal Perspectives","This study comprises a multimodal examination of attempts at the turn of the twenty-first century to revitalize the historic downtown district of the small but historically significant northern Arizona town of Winslow, located at the crossroads of ancient and contemporary travel routes across the southern section of a high desert region known as the Colorado Plateau. This investigation represents an in-depth study of a space whose history has been recorded only briefly at best and analyzed not at all. From videotaped interviews and events collected over the span of twelve years, news articles, various primary documents and still photographs, and communication with individuals related by family history to Winslow, this study chronicles a civic move to effect a local ""renaissance"" by restoring commercial and civic enterprise at the center of Winslow's once-vital ""main street."" It traces efforts to save Winslow's historic Harvey House, La Posada, from demolition and support its restoration, establish a park and a music festival to attract visitors by memorializing a particularly iconic song, the Eagles' ""Take it Easy,"" and, in conjunction with a national preservation movement begun in the 1990s, revivify interest in Winslow as a stop along the ""Mother Road"" (Route 66). Different groups of citizens faced unique challenges under twenty-first century conditions of economy, location, and social expectation as they set out to return a moribund commercial district to its historical function as remembered by native residents and anticipated by unfamiliar travelers. Set against the nineteenth and early twentieth century background of Winslow's birth and development years the analysis considers the meaning of ""renaissance"" desires at the turn of the twenty-first, based as they were on material ideals of economic revival in a place and at a time when central cities nationwide were experiencing decline. The project combines seven chapters of written history with five short visual documentaries, each of which illustrates the nature of the place and cultural qualities of its residents as they participated in the alteration of their local image. While the historic hotel that people hoped would serve as a catalyst to downtown revitalization was restored beyond almost everyone's expectations, neither commerce nor the architectural landscape that had once accommodated it was revived in Winslow's downtown. The success gap resulted from differences in market appeal: La Posada had a market; downtown Winslow did not. Still, the town's renaissance dreams were not completely dashed.",,,
1206,Mixed Reality Simulation,"Controllability and reproducibility are two of the main principles of the scientific method and yet traditional user experiments in the domain of Augmented Reality (AR) display systems are very difficult to control and repeat. Due to the many choices in hardware and software, it is generally the case that each display system is unique. This makes it difficult for researchers to repeat experiments performed by others. By using the traditional approach, a researcher would need the exact display system (or something very close to it) to repeat an experiment. This can be costly and impractical and does not allow individual components to be controlled in an experiment. Mixed Reality (MR) Simulation is a practical approach to conducting controlled and repeatable experiments. MR Simulation is the concept of using a high-fidelity Virtual Reality (VR) display system to simulate a range of lower-fidelity display systems. We can simulate a variety of display systems used by other researchers by simulating the level of fidelity of said systems, making it practical for reproducing previous experiments. This approach also offers more controllability when we conduct user experiments because by simulating the hardware, the software, and even the environment, we can potentially control all factors in an Augmented Reality experiment which is often impossible with real-world setups. An added benefit of using MR Simulation is the ability of evaluating non-existing or hard to obtain technologies by simply simulating the technology. This dissertation investigates the validity of this approach. Through a series of experiments we empirically show that for a representative set of tasks and conditions, it is both practical and valid to run AR user experiments using MR Simulation. We present new results showing the effect of latency on object manipulation and visual search in AR workspaces. Lastly, we also demonstrate the use of MR Simulation as a testing ground for novel MR display systems.",,,
1207,Graph-Based Transductive Learning for Visual Classification and Retrieval,"Advances in sensor technology have enabled the rapid generation of large volumes of visual data. Visual data representation and extraction of meaningful semantics from raw pixels continue to be major research problems in computer vision. This dissertation focuses on exploring novel techniques for the construction of graph-based models for visual classification and retrieval. The first part of this work will discuss the integration of multiple features for multi-label classification in a graph framework. We show that by construction of a bi-relational graph with heterogeneous nodes and edges, feature complementariness and label correlation can be exploited simultaneously to obtain better classification results. In the second part, we focus on modeling the high-order (among three of more objects) relationship of visual data with a hypergraph representation. This is in contrast with the more conventional graph model where only pairwise connectivity between objects is described. We show that the local grouping information captured by the neighborhood structure in a hypergraph model is beneficial for image retrieval. In the third part, we propose extending the graph-based framework for search in a distributed camera network. We model the cross-camera linkage with a set of linear regression functions based on local motion in each pair of camera regions. Quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted in a real world distributed camera network to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",,,
1208,Assessing ship movements using volunteered geographic information,"Shipping, the ocean transportation of people and goods, moves most world trade, and understanding its effects is required to assess human use of the oceans. This work examines the shipping trade by combining global observations of ship location with vessel identification records, and interpreting the results in an ecological context. By incorporating quality checking methods with volunteered geographic information, I provide a spatially resolved high resolution dataset which links individual ships with their movement patterns and vessel attributes. This contributes knowledge on the state and distribution of shipping, and identifies areas where mitigation of impacts are achievable.",,,
1209,Hybrid Silicon Photonic Integration using Quantum Well Intermixing,"With the push for faster data transfer across all domains of telecommunication, optical interconnects are transitioning into shorter range applications such as in data centers and personal computing. Silicon photonics, with its economic advantages of leveraging well-established silicon manufacturing facilities, is considered the most promising approach to further scale down the cost and size of optical interconnects for chip-to-chip communication. Intrinsic properties of silicon however limit its ability to generate and modulate light, both of which are key to realizing on-chip optical data transfer. The hybrid silicon approach directly addresses this problem by using molecularly bonded III-V epitaxial layers on silicon for optical gain and absorption. This technology includes direct transfer of III-V wafer to a pre-patterned silicon-on-insulator wafer. Several discrete devices for light generation, modulation, amplification and detection have already been demonstrated on this platform. As in the case of electronics, multiple photonic elements can be integrated on a single chip to improve performance and functionality. However, scalable photonic integration requires the ability to control the bandgap for individual devices along with design changes to simplify fabrication. In the research presented here, quantum well intermixing is used as a technique to define multiple bandgaps for integration on the hybrid silicon platform. Implantation enhanced disordering is used to generate four bandgaps spread over 120+ nm. By combining these selectively intermixed III-V layers with pre-defined gratings and waveguides on silicon, we fabricate distributed feedback, distributed Bragg reflector, Fabry-Perot and mode-locked lasers along with photodetectors, electro-absorption modulators and other test structures, all on a single chip. We demonstrate a broadband laser source with continuous-wave operational lasers over a 200 nm bandwidth. Some of these lasers are integrated with modulators with a 3-dB bandwidth above 25 GHz, thus demonstrating coarse wavelength division multiplexing transmitter on silicon.",,,
1210,"Buddhists, Brahmans, and Buddhist Brahmans: Negotiating Identities in Indian Antiquity","In this dissertation, I explore the way in which early Buddhists formed their own self-identity vis-a-vis Vedic Brahmans. Interestingly, while today we understand Buddhism and Hinduism as separate religions, and Brahmans as belonging to the latter religion, early Buddhist texts frequently refer to the Buddha, his enlightened disciples, or just the ""ideal person"" in the abstract as Brahmans. Many previous scholars have argued or assumed that the category ""Brahman"" was a term that belonged properly to the ""Brahmanical tradition,"" whose roots long pre-date Buddhism, and thus concluded that early Buddhist uses of the word Brahman (brahman&dotbelow;a) should be interpreted as ""borrowings"" from the Brahmanical tradition, made for the purpose of polemic. I, however, argue that the word Brahman was a contested category that was not ""owned"" by a monolithic Brahmanical tradition and then borrowed by Buddhists to use polemically, but that it was a common honorific term that was actively contested by both Buddhists and (Vedic) Brahmans and only with time ceded by the former to the latter. In making this argument, I make use of a wide variety of early South Asian sources, including Brahmanical texts, inscriptions, and early Buddhist texts preserved in Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan. In the first part of my dissertation, I show that while there was a common vocabulary for describing religious practitioners in ancient India, Buddhist and Brahmanical texts deployed them differently in an effort to construct a unique and superior identity for their own respective ideals. Then, in the second part, I argue that the earliest Buddhist literature makes use of the word brahman&dotbelow;a (""Brahman"") simply as an honorific for the ideal person, while later elaborations on this usage convert this simple honorific into a polemic against the Vedic Brahmans, who are depicted as unworthy of the name by which they call themselves. Finally, in the third part of my dissertation, I examine texts that I refer to as ""encounter dialogs""---texts in which the Buddha encounters an interlocutor who is identified as a Brahman, and argue that through the implicit narrative structure of these texts, Buddhists effectively ceded the category ""Brahman.""",,,
1211,"The Stratigraphic and Geomorphic Evolution of the Bull Creek Valley, Oklahoma: Implications for Paleoclimate Studies and Nanodiamond Occurrence","The Younger Dryas is a well-recognized climatic event, but researchers have yet to agree upon which mechanism was responsible for the rapid cooling in the northern hemisphere. A spike in nanodiamond presence at the Younger Dryas boundary has been reported in sediments from the Bull Creek valley in Oklahoma and used to support a recently proposed impact hypothesis. However, this record was compiled from a heterogeneous mix of sediment from different fluvial subenvironments. In order for the significance of a unique occurrence of nanodiamonds to be determined, a full appreciation of the other changes that occurred within the valley throughout its evolution must be taken into account. These changes may have impacted sediment character as well as sediment preservation and the processes governing deposition, all of which could impact nanodiamond accumulation and preservation. The purpose of this study is to build an evolutionary model for the Bull Creek valley spanning the last 16,000 years in order to place nanodiamond occurrence into stratigraphic context. Fluvial terraces were mapped and their sediments described within the valley. Results indicate the valley has undergone at least four cycles of cutting and filling, creating five sets of discontinuous fluvial terraces. The sedimentary sequence preserved in the terraces records the transition from a perennial fluvial system during the late glacial to a cool yet dry environment during the Younger Dryas, followed by an arid environment dominated by eolian processes and punctuated by flooding events. Although the sediment character of the Younger Dryas soil is unique, the occurrence of nanodiamonds within it is not. No correlation was found between nanodiamond abundance and landscape exposure time.",,,
1212,Evidence-Based Practices: A View from the Trenches,"The purpose of the current study was to examine factors that influence the implementation of evidence-based treatments (EBT) to address the behavioral needs of children with developmental disabilities or mental illnesses. The researching question was: What factors do trained behavioral treatment practitioners perceive as affecting their implementation of effective behavioral treatments in the settings in which they work? Ten behavioral practitioners participated in semi-structured interviews in which they were asked their perspectives on what they identified as factors that either helped or hindered their implementation of EBTs. Participant interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using methods informed by modified grounded theory. Two major themes emerged from the participants' responses: (a) ineffective systems; (b) buy-in. The findings of this study were consistent with previous research examining the implementation of EBTs across a variety of professional disciplines. These findings extend the current literature by presenting information gleaned from trained behavioral treatment practitioners, whose perspectives suggest specific actions that may be taken to improve the process of utilizing EBTs to support those in need. Major themes as well as contextual factors associated with the participants' implementation of EBTs are described. Implications for training of behavioral practitioners, behavioral practice issues, as well as policy and advocacy considerations are discussed.",,,
1213,Effects of Conformation on Charge Flow in Gas-Phase Peptides,"Neutral, unprotected phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine (FGG) has been found to adopt four distinct rotational conformers under jet-cooling conditions. These conformers include one dispersion-stabilized folded conformer and three extended conformers with little interaction between termini. Conformer-specific ionization followed by photodissociation via visible radiation results in photofragmentation ratios that differ according to the type of neutral conformer from which the ion was formed. The folded structure of FGG yields a fragment-to-parent ion ratio of 1.4; the extended structures yield fragment-to-parent ion ratios around 0.3. The reverse peptide sequence, Glycyl-glycyl-phenylalanine (GGF), which has been found to adopt one folded and one extended conformer under the experimental conditions, acts similarly to FGG in that its folded structure exhibits a greater fragmentation ratio. The folded conformer of GGF fragments with a fragment-to-parent ratio of 3, and the extended conformer fragments with a 0.5 ratio. These results suggest that these peptides do not have time to photoisomerize under the experimental conditions, as the extent of fragmentation depends on the starting neutral structure. Photofragmentation in this experiment is controlled by the distribution of charge in the peptide - positive charge on the phenyl chromophore shifts its absorption spectrum to the visible range and thus allows absorption of sufficient energy for dissociation via visible radiation of the molecule. The possible mechanism by which secondary structure influences charge flow in these peptides was explored using quantum chemical calculations. It is proposed that, based on calculated neutral-to-cation geometry changes and charge distributions, differences in charge delocalization propensities among conformer types may cause the differences in charge flow.",,,
1215,Fundamental Investigations of Phase Separation in Multiphase Fluids,"Multiphase fluids are ubiquitous in foods and industrial manufacturing. In some cases it is desirable to create stable mixtures of immiscible phases, like mayonnaise or shampoo, while in other cases an efficient phase separation is required, such as the extraction of oil from naturally occurring oil sands. In both cases, a fundamental understanding of the physics governing the phase separation process is needed to improve the final product and reduce the manufacturing cost. In this dissertation, the physical mechanisms leading to phase separation in foams, emulsions, and suspensions are investigated from a fundamental point of view. As such, the experimental techniques employed herein are applied to simplified systems, usually consisting of just two, micron-sized particles (e.g. droplets or vesicles) within a suspending fluid. In fact, a new experimental apparatus called a Cantilevered-Capillary Force Apparatus (CCFA) was developed as a major part of this work, that is specifically designed to make unique measurements on just one or two of these particles. The new apparatus is particularly useful for testing theoretical predictions on these types of simplified systems. The CCFA was used to make the first reported force measurements of the adhesion of two vesicles in suspension. The work of adhesion was found to be dependent on the degree of deformability of the vesicles. The CCFA was also used to characterize the adhesion mechanism of model food emulsion particles and to measure rheological properties of individual particles. The individual particles with a high volume fraction of internal solids were found to behave like a yield stress fluid and to adhere by forming capillary bridges. A third study was performed using the CCFA to measure the time scale for emulsion droplets to coalesce in a quiescent fluid when compressed together with a constant force. Here the time scale for coalescence is referred to as the ""drainage time'' because the rate-limiting step is the drainage of suspending fluid from the thin film of fluid that separates the drops when they collide. The drainage time was found to be only weakly dependent on the magnitude of the compressive force, but quite sensitive to the droplet size. An additional study of the drainage time between expanding, foam bubbles in a quiescent fluid was performed. The dependence of the drainage time on the bubble size and growth rate was found to differ dramatically from dependence for expanding drops under similar conditions. Work was also done as a part of this dissertation to improve the existing theoretical predictions that employ a scaling approach to predicting the dynamics of the phase separation process. In conjunction with this theoretical work, boundary-integral simulations were utilized to test some of the assumptions built into the theory. It was demonstrated that there is a physical constraint on the length scale over which the pressure gradient in a thin film with a free interface can occur under conditions relevant to emulsion droplets and vesicles in suspension.",,,
1216,Evaluation of Seismic Methods for Inferring Fluid Migration in Volcanic Regions,"The classic concepts of fluid transport derived for sedimentary environments are generally not applicable to the study of magmatic transport. High fluid viscosity and negligible rock permeability should preclude magma transport, yet dikes, sills, and other intrusive features are commonly observed. Relationships between intrusive units and regional paleo-stress fields are well described, but the dynamic interactions between igneous fluid and competent rock that ultimately produce magma intrusions are not. Elevated seismicity is often observed in conjunction with volcanic activity, and is generally thought to indicate magmatic intrusion. This study examined the unique information that seismic data can provide about magmatic processes as they occur. Specifically, methods for deriving transport volume from fluid induced seismicity were evaluated. An approach proposed by Herbert Shaw linked total scalar seismic moment release and source region volume distortion. This relationship was tested using data from various fluid injection experiments by comparing observed seismicity with injected fluid volume. A second method examined seismic events from an earthquake swarm near the Yellowstone caldera for evidence of tensile-crack source mechanisms, which couldindicate igneous intrusion. Similar investigations have been successfully conducted using larger magnitude events. The Yellowstone swarm events were too small for traditional approaches, but were appropriately sized to assess the suitability of a different inversion technique for characterizing smaller events. A technique for improving the quality of the seismic dataset is also discussed. After further development, the techniques described may provide additional constraints on rates of active magma transport in volcanic areas. The results obtained by this study were generally consistent with predictions of the McGarr-Shaw method, and have illuminated the additional considerations that must be addressed when testing the relationship using aqueous fluid injection rather than magmatic intrusion. Analysis of non-double-couple (NDC) events during earthquake swarms revealed that the currently deployed seismic network does not provide the coverage necessary to examine events of such low magnitude. Conducting a proper evaluation of the NDC inversion technique for inferring fluid transport will require additional broadband seismometer deployment at Yellowstone, or the selection of a new study area.",,,
1217,Life Stories of Graduate Students in Chile and the United States: Becoming a Scientist from Childhood to Adulthood,"The purpose of this cross-national study was to gain a more comprehensive understanding about doctoral students in the United States and Chile and how their decisions to pursue a career in the life sciences field occurred throughout their lives. . I interviewed 15 doctoral students from the Seven Lakes University (Chile) and 15 students from the West Coast University (US), using a life history approach. Analyses revealed that the degree of flexibility in the schooling system and the degree of individualism and collectivism of the social groups in which the students were learning science seemed to influence the informants' vocational decisions in three interrelated processes: (1) Deciding the informants' degree of interest and ability in science by the opportunity of choosing science classes and activities. The highly tracked Chilean system socializes students to science at an early age. The more flexible school system in the US enabled the interviewees to gradually decide about pursuing their interest in science; (2) Experiencing science as a collective learning process for the Chilean informants and an individualistic learning process for the US students; (3) Perceiving science differently at each life stage for both groups of interviewees including: Playing science, Studying science, Doing science, Working in science, Practicing Science in their doctoral programs.",,,
1218,A Grammar of Southern Pomo An Indigenous Language of California,"Southern Pomo is a moribund indigenous language, one of seven closely related Pomoan languages once spoken in Northern California in the vicinity of the Russian River drainage, Clear Lake, and the adjacent Pacific coast. This work is the first full-length grammar of the language. It is divided into three parts. Part I introduces the sociocultural situation. This section introduces the material culture and physical environment of Southern Pomo speakers and the violent upheavals which destroyed their world. It also introduces the data sources on which this grammar is based. Part II is a detailed structural overview of Southern Pomo. It introduces the sound inventory of the language and delves into its phonological alternations. It also introduces the different word classes together with a morpheme-by-morpheme inventory of the affixes and clitics with which the word classes are associated. Part III covers the sentence structure of Southern Pomo. It describes the different clauses and clause combining strategies present in the language, including the robust switch-reference system. This section also discusses the agent/patient case system and other clause-level phenomena.",,,
1219,Mechanisms and Mitigation of CMAS Attack on Thermal Barrier Coatings,"As gas turbine engines are driven to operate at higher temperatures to maximize efficiency, components become susceptible to attack by deposits of calcium magnesium alumino-silicate (CMAS) ingested with the intake air. Of particular interest to this work is the degradation of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) by CMAS. Molten CMAS is known to interact with TBCs both thermochemically, by dissolving the ceramic and reprecipitating it as a new or modified phase, and thermomechanically, by infiltrating the porosity and degrading the strain tolerance. The thermochemical degradation of TBCs was investigated using primarily differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) by comparing the endotherms and exotherms recorded for pure, model silicates to those observed for silicates mixed with various TBC materials including YSZ and GZO. The five ternary silicates studied (CaO-AlO1.5-SiO2) began melting over a relatively narrow range (_1125-1145C). Introducing magnesium to the ternary results in higher melting temperatures and only minor changes to the crystallization behavior. Iron decreases the melting temperature, and markedly improves the crystallization kinetics of pure silicate systems, especially absent magnesium. Modification of the crystallization behavior of pure silicates has been proposed in the literature as a mitigation strategy for CMAS. This work utilizes DSC to look for characteristic changes as described above to probe potentially effective TBCs. The addition of YSZ to a quaternary CMAS results in little change to the melting or crystallization in the DSC, despite the dissolution of YSZ into the silicate. In stark contrast, GZO with CMAS generates a significant crystallization exotherm that appears in the DSC immediately after the silicate melts. As the fraction of GZO is increased, the melting endotherm begins to shrink due to the thermal overlap of the melting and crystallization processes. This signifies a rapid reaction, and a potentially useful TBC material for CMAS mitigation. Several additional TBC materials are tested and discussed including Y2Zr2O7, La2Zr 2O7, La2Ce2O7, and GdAlO 3. Stemming from these results, isothermal exposures of silicates on GZO TBCs demonstrated the influence of CMAS loading and exposure time on both penetration and the recession front depth, as well as the importance of silicate viscosity on the competition between infiltration time and reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the present study illuminates several factors relevant to the mechanical degradation of both yttria stablizaed zirconia (YSZ) and gadolinium zirconate (GZO) by molten CMAS through the use of a laser gradient test (LGT) designed following the mechanical model of Evans and Hutchinson. Number of cycles, CMAS loading, CTE mismatch, and most of all, for the LGT, coating toughness influenced the location and extent of cracking within the TBC exposed to CMAS. Both the chemical and mechanical considerations and experimental protocol developed in this investigation lay the groundwork for assessing the CMAS resistance of next generation TBCs.",,,
1221,Analysis of Geographically Embedded Networks,"Geographically embedded networks (GENets) are systems of physical and abstract linked relationships contained wholly or partially within geographic space. The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the question, ""what are the particular characteristics of networks in geography?"" To uncover such properties, a series of network case studies is examined and each translated into computational data structures or workflows. Constrained as computational models, the cases are assessed and compared for patterns and common approaches. The modeling serves, 1) as a methodological template for the discovery of network properties, and 2) to reveal an initial set of characteristics for consideration based on the contemporary state of quantitative geographical analysis. The use cases are examined first by focusing on data structures and second through analytical workflows. The data structure use cases were selected to represent diverse GENet conditions and include Minard's map of Napoleon's March on Moscow, a Census table of state-to-state human migration, and a GIS dataset of the flow routes in Kentucky's Mammoth Cave karst watershed. The analytical workflow use cases include an optimization problem (shortest path calculation), a process model (stream network generation from an elevation model), a simulation (growth along an urban corridor), and a GIS feature comparison (selection of streets bounding a city block). Commonalities from the data structure cases are distilled into a general model, but the analytical cases cannot be similarly reconciled. In order to make the geographic aspects of the analytical cases explicit, the cases are evaluated against a set of tests for spatial models devised by Goodchild (2012). From the case studies and tests, GENet characteristics can be subdivided into two categories: those that are properties of network with respect to the physical environment and those that are properties of representation. GENets with arcs or nodes that physically exist in the environment may exhibit characteristics of constituent heterogeneity and areal interaction. GENets representations are affected by issues of scale and spatial uncertainty. To evaluate these characteristics in a GIS implementation, an itinerary planning GENet problem, the Geyser Travel Problem, is introduced. The problem offers a practical application of GENet workflows in GIS and an avenue for discussion of associated best practices.",,,
1222,Characterizing ground states of low-dimensional quantum magnets,"The study of frustration in quantum magnetism has been the focus of extensive research in the past couple of decades. The class of materials in this category is typically strongly correlated, due to strong electron-electron repulsion. In one- and two-dimensions, quantum fluctuations dominate these systems, and often, semi-classical approximations become an oversimplification. This thesis is concerned with exploring exotic physics that can emerge in low-dimensional quantum magnets. First, we use a T = 0 projected Monte Carlo algorithm in the valence bond basis to study the entanglement scaling of two-dimensional (2d) gapless systems. In particular, we focus on the resonating-valence-bond wavefunction as well as the gapless Goldstone mode in the Heisenberg model on the square lattice. We find that, in addition to the area law, there is a subleading, shape-dependent piece to the entanglement entropy, which is reminiscent of one dimensional (1d) gapless systems. We then explore the Heisenberg model under an applied magnetic field on the quasi-1d problem of a three-leg triangular spin tube (TST), using extensive density-matrix-renormalization group calculations coupled with analytical arguments to describe the results. We find that the physics describing this model differs from some of the well-known results on the two dimensional lattice, especially near low magnetic fields and at 1/3 magnetization. Finally, further research and possibilities in numerical techniques are discussed.",,,
1223,Repeated low-dose methamphetamine produces dynamic neuroadaptations in the mouse nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex,"This dissertation examines the effects of withdrawal from repeated low-dose methamphetamine upon the dopamine and glutamate systems of the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. Presented here are studies which examine the hypothesis that repeated low-dose methamphetamine produces time-dependent alterations in dopamine and glutamate transmission which are distinct from those produced by either high-dose methamphetamine, or low-dose amphetamine and cocaine. Specifically, these studies address the following aims: 1) Characterize the short- and long-term consequences of repeated low-dose methamphetamine upon basal and stimulated release of dopamine and glutamate in the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex; 2) Explore potential mechanism through which repeated methamphetamine administration produces changes in nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex neurotransmission. The data herein demonstrate that withdrawal from repeated methamphetamine exposure dynamically alters basal and stimulated release of dopamine and glutamate within these brain structures. Moreover, these data point to a number of molecular and functional abnormalities in the receptors and transporters which regulate dopamine and glutamate release and reuptake as potential underpinnings of the changes observed in neurotransmission. These findings are discussed individually within the context of the current psychostimulant literature, as well as how these neuroadaptations may work in concert to produce robust abnormalities in neurotransmission and drug-associated behavior.",,,
1224,"Communication and Identity Negotiation Processes by Professionals in Health Care Organizations: Examining Race, Gender, and Class Intersections","In recent years, health care organizations have drastically changed. A more diffuse network of organizations provides patient care, and many of these organizations have moved to a managed care model that primarily relies on team-based communication structures. With such changes, the roles of health care professionals have changed as well and it has become increasingly difficult to negotiate one's role and identity in relation to colleagues, patients, families, and other stakeholders. Additionally, with the changing demographics of the United States population, other personal identities (such as race, gender, and class) are affecting the ways that care is provided and identities are negotiated in health care organizations. This dissertation examines these issues, with particular focus on understanding the multiple professional and personal identities that health care professionals inhabit and how they are continually negotiated through communication. In order to understand the complexities of health care professionals' identities and their configurations, this study builds on the concept of the crystallized self, the idea that identity is multidimensional and continually negotiated through communication. Specifically, this study asks how health care professionals conceive of their multiple identities and their interrelationships. In addition, using feminist standpoint theory as a lens, this study seeks to understand how an individual's social location within a culture shapes their experience, particularly as one's experience is shaped by the intersection of professional and personal identities. This dissertation utilizes a two-phase, mixed methods approach to understanding the identity negotiation processes of health care professionals. The first phase of the study involved qualitative interviews with 50 health care professionals in the western United States. These interviews provided some initial insights into the crystallized self by identifying various identities that health care professionals manage and ways that they engage in identity negotiation processes. Three primary themes emerged from the interview data. First, identities were regionalized primarily into the work and home areas, while community and educational spaces were secondary regions for identity negotiation. Second, health care professionals experienced a major tension when working out the degree of overlap or separation between the work and home regions. For most, the goal was to have separation between the two regions, but the ability to achieve this desired outcome was highly related to one's access to resources that would facilitate this goal. Third, race, gender, and class were found to be influential personal identities that affected identity negotiation processes in important ways. Using the qualitative findings as a touchstone, the second phase of the study conducted a quantitative survey with 206 health care professionals throughout the United States. Using latent class analysis, the data highlighted three potential standpoints of health care professionals with regard to identity negotiation: one standpoint focused on managing work and home life, a second prioritized integrity over all other responsibilities, and a third was primarily family-oriented. In addition, the data showed that health care professionals suffered when their personal sense of self did not align with the identity they portrayed at work. As a result of this identity gap, feelings of organizational assimilation and job satisfaction decreased. In summary, this study examines identity negotiation processes for health care professionals. Findings demonstrate that while these professionals continually negotiate multiple identities, they do so with clear ramifications for their organizational experiences. The conclusion of this dissertation discusses the implications of these findings in relation to identity negotiation, the crystallized self, and work-life balance.",,,
1226,Magnetic Characterization Using Nitrogen Vacancy Centers in Diamond,"Nitrogen Vacancy centers in diamond are promising candidates for spin based detection of small magnetic fields on the nanometer scale. Due to the unique level structure of these defects, optical initialization and readout as well as coherent manipulation of the electronic spin state is possible under ambient conditions. The minimum achievable magnetic field sensitivity is theoretically constrained only by the spin dephasing time, T*2 , which can be quite long at room temperature. The theoretical minimum spatial resolution is only limited by the extent of the electron wavefunction, which extends over a few lattice sites in the diamond crystal. The aim of this work is to test these limits with particular interest in their applicability to measuring magnetic systems. We demonstrate a technique which provides full vector extraction of the fringing fields around micron scale magnetic objects with a sensitivity of 10 muT/ Hz and a spatial resolution of 0.4 microm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these values can be improved upon. Pulsed microwave techniques provide a pathway for extending the magnetic field sensitivity down to 2 microT/ Hz . Also, using optical super-resolution microscopy we can improve the spatial resolution down to 50 nm.",,,
1227,"Nihil ""overcomes"" nihilism: a study of ""Nothing"" in Heidegger's ""Being and Time"" and ""What is Metaphysics?""","This paper is placed within the general topic of the ""overcoming"" of nihilism. It explores a homeopathic path of ""overcoming"" nihilism; in short: nihil ""overcomes"" nihilism. Rather than attempt overcoming, or sublimation, or dialectical sublation, nihil (nothing) might change our relation to nihilism. While there is no way out of the nihilist experience of the lack of why, an ""original"" experience of ""nothing"" can disclose a different way of dwelling in nihilism. In the first section of this paper, I introduce the problem of nihilism. Focusing on Nietzsche's account of it, I lay the ground and raise the problem that this study of ""nothing"" aims to answer. How to live without an ultimate why? How to live when we are constantly haunted by the possibility that all what we do is in vain? Not escaping from the lack of why, but rather listening to what this ""lack"" has to tell us, this paper studies the notion of ""nothing."" From the second to the sixth section, I work on what is the core of this paper: Martin Heidegger's suggestion of ""nothing's"" disclosure of the wonder of Being. I focus on Heidegger's early analysis of ""nothing"" as developed in his 1927 work Being and Time and his 1929 lecture What is Metaphysics? It is Heidegger's particular experience of ""nothing""---in which Being itself is disclosed---that can transform our sense of meaninglessness into wonder. Hence, still within nihilism, indeed thanks to it, the readiness to experience ""nothing"" reveals the fact---without why---that beings are instead of nothing. In sections seven and eight, after having explored the analysis of the complex phenomenon of ""nothing,"" I return to the problem of nihilism outlined in the first section. In section seven, the previous analysis allows to see how Heidegger's specific notion of ""nothing"" can change our relationship to nihilism. In section eight, I situate the conclusions achieved in this paper in the context of some contemporary discussion about the philosophical notion of wonder.",,,
1228,Asymptotic Behavior of Worst Case Scenario Prices in Uncertain Volatility Models,"Financial derivatives have been widely used for investments or transfer risks among different parties. It has been an important topic to determine their prices. The celebrated model by Fisher Black, Robert Merton and Myron Scholes is the progenitor to modern finance. However, its application is restricted due to the constant volatility assumption. Therefore, the uncertain volatility models and worst case scenario analysis are introduced [4] and [32] to consider the amount of risk in derivative pricing. In this dissertation, we discuss the asymptotic behaviors of the worst case scenario price under an uncertain volatility model. We are mainly interested in how the worst case scenario price behaves as the degree of model uncertainty vanishes. We derive the derivative of the worst case scenario price with respect to the interval size: epsilon at epsilon = 0. This study produces an approximation of the worst case scenario price or the worst case scenario volatility process. If the volatility interval is small in the model, we need only to solve two linear PDEs to approximate the solution of a fully nonlinear PDE: Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation.",,,
1229,"Glacial areas, lakes areas, and snowlines from 1975-2012: Status of the Cordillera Vilcanota, including the Quelccaya Ice Cap, northern central Andes, Peru","Glaciers in the tropical Andes of southern Peru have received limited attention compared to glaciers in other regions (both near and far), yet remain of vital importance to agriculture, fresh water, and hydropower supplies of downstream communities. Little is known about recent glacial-area changes and how the glaciers in this region respond to climate changes, and, ultimately, how these changes will affect lake and water supplies. To remedy this, we have used 144 multi-spectral satellite images spanning almost four decades, from 1975-2012, to obtain glacial and lake-area outlines for the understudied Cordillera Vilcanota region, including the Quelccaya Ice Cap. In a second step, we have estimated the snowline altitude of the Quelccaya Ice Cap using spectral unmixing methods. We have made the following four key observations: First, since 1988 glacial areas throughout the Cordillera Vilcanota have been declining at a rate of 5.46 +/- 1.70 km2/yr (22-year average, 1988-2010, with 95 % confidence interval). The Quelccaya Ica Cap, specifically, has been declining at a rate of 0.67 +/- 0.18 km2/yr since 1980 (31-year average, 1980-2011, also with 95 % confidence interval); Second, decline rates for individual glacierized regions have been accelerating during the past decade (2000-2011) as compared to the preceding decade (1990-2000); Third, the snowline of the Quelccaya Ice Cap is retreating to higher elevations as glacial areas decrease, by a total of almost 300 m between its lowest recorded elevation in 1989 and its highest in 1998; and fourth, as glacial regions have decreased, 61 % of lakes connected to glacial watersheds have shown a roughly synchronous increase in lake area, while 84 % of lakes not connected to glacial watersheds have remained stable or have declined in area. Our new and detailed data on glacial and lake areas over 37 years provide an important spatiotemporal assessment of climate variability in this area. These data can be integrated into further studies to analyze inter-annual glacial and lake-area changes and assess hydrologic dependence and consequences for downstream populations.",,,
1230,Standardized Cognitive Assessments in Children with Autism,"Research suggests that test design can interact with symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) such that different standardized cognitive tests may be more or less likely to evoke behaviors that interfere with assessment of functioning. This study compares the results of two recommended and commonly used cognitive assessments (Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children --- Fourth Edition and Differential Ability Scales --- Second Edition) in a sample of children diagnosed with ASD and considers the influence of autistic symptomatology, adaptive behavior, and behavior during test administration on cognitive scores. Convergent validity was established for these instruments. However, participants achieved significantly higher overall scores on the DAS-II. Nearly half of the sample received different classification labels on the two assessments. All of these children had higher DAS-II scores. More than a quarter of the sample achieved scores with non-overlapping 95% confidence bands. Behavior during test administration did not systematically vary between tests and was not related to cognitive scores, with the exception of a negative association between off-topic behavior and overall cognitive scores. Autistic symptomatology was not associated with cognitive scores, while adaptive behavior was positively associated with scores. Neither was associated with the magnitude of difference between overall scores on the two assessments. The difference between overall scores was found to be attributable to a relative weakness in processing speed, which is assessed on the WISC-IV but not the DAS-II. Clinically, this study suggests that cognitive assessment is a valuable part of a comprehensive assessment for children with ASD as these tests appear to be minimally impacted by construct-irrelevant variance. However, choice of assessment should be considered carefully given the systematic differences in overall scores produced in this population. Similarly, results suggest that patterns of responding in children with ASD on select subtests deviate from the standardization sample, possibly due to symptoms of ASD. Examiners should be familiar with these issues and interpret tests accordingly. Future research should investigate the effects of examiner experience and role of non-standardized aspects of the assessments protocols.",,,
1231,High School to College Drinking Trajectories: Responsiveness to a College Harm Reduction Program,"Alcohol use is a serious public health concern plaguing universities across the country. Drinking patterns, however, often form before the college years. This retrospective study explores the drinking patterns of 443 first- and second-year college students who violated their university's substance use policies and were mandated to a harm-reduction intervention. Students' high school to college drinking trajectories were identified by endorsing certain risk indicators in high school which were used to create---Low, Moderate, and High---High School Risk Groups. Results indicate that these High School Risk Groups significantly differentiate among high school drinking variables as well as predict college drinking patterns. Responsiveness to a harm-reduction intervention differed by High School Risk Group with the High Risk group showing a decrease on total drinks per week and times intoxicated per month from intake to follow-up. Furthermore, physical and/or sexual abuse and a drug history in high school are associated with higher risk levels. Educational factors such as higher GPA and attendance at public school appear to be protective factors against higher risk levels for alcohol consumption in high school. A three-tiered intervention model is suggested to address the risk levels for alcohol consumption both in college and in high school. This study calls for a continuum of prevention and intervention services to be implemented at different ages, for all risk levels, and for every student, regardless of academic success.",,,
1232,Efficacy of A Computer-based Intervention in Reducing Internalized Heterosexism,"Recent studies have found that Internalized Heterosexism (IH) is a strong predictor of the psychological well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning and same-sex attracted (LGBQ) individuals. To respond to the call for more effective interventions to address IH and its impact on LGBQ individuals, the current study developed and tested an online intervention to reduce IH among gay, bisexual, questioning and same-sex attracted (GBQ) men. A total of 367 adult GBQ males were recruited from nation-wide LGBQ-related sources and were randomly assigned to either the experimental condition (focusing on IH reduction) or the control condition (in which a similarly structured invention focusing on stress management was administered). The differences between the two conditions were compared on variables of IH and affect after the intervention. The findings give preliminary evidence that a brief Web-based intervention can effectively reduce IH among GBQ men. The results also showed that participants as a whole in the experimental condition reported higher levels of positive affect than their counterparts, as a group, in the control condition. In addition, the measured level of involvement in the intervention associated significantly with the effect of the intervention, suggesting that involvement plays a facilitating role. Implications for research and practice are discussed.",,,
1233,Student Engagement and Motivation: An Evaluation of Their Relations to Social- Emotional and Behavioral Functioning,"Student engagement and motivation have historically been studied within two different research literatures with little convergence. Recently, scholars have begun to integrate these two constructs with the examination of various school-related outcomes such as dropout, delinquency, and academic achievement. Few studies have examined social-emotional/behavioral functioning as the outcome. This study examined the relations between student engagement, motivation, and social-emotional and behavioral functioning in a sample of sixth-grade students. Specifically, a model in which engagement mediates the relation between motivation and social-emotional/behavioral functioning was tested. This hypothesized model was not supported; rather an alternative model emerged in which motivation is the mediator in the relation between engagement and social-emotional/behavioral functioning. A closer examination of each of the indicators of engagement and motivation revealed that certain indicators of engagement and motivation tended to align with each other. Interpretation of results and implications for practice are discussed.",,,
1234,Wide-Area Visual Modeling and Tracking for Mobile Augmented Reality,"The vision of ""Anywhere Augmentation"" is to enable a ubiquitous augmented reality experience, indoors and out, by leveraging existing geographic resources and providing tools to easily map new spaces with cheap, off-the-shelf hardware. My work considers the use of panoramic datasets to provide complete and detailed environment models for accurate mobile localization and tracking. I present an end-to-end system which covers modeling, localization and tracking for AR. The implementation is demonstrated with the Apple iPad 2 as a mobile AR tablet, using a remote server for computationally heavy localization queries. This dissertation discusses the details of my methods and my contributions to outdoor modeling and tracking for AR. Outdoor visual modeling is improved by using the ""upright"" constraint, which requires that all images be aligned to a common vertical. The resulting model is used to determine the location of a mobile device by matching the camera image to the point cloud. I consider the problem of latency between the mobile device and the localization server, and present strategies to handle this latency. Continuous device localization is achieved by real-time tracking on the mobile device, which is shown to be robust to illumination change. In addition, I evaluate the relationship between modeling effort and localization performance, to determine the feasibility of in situ reconstruction of large spaces by a mobile user. The work leads to insights and future directions for pursuing a state-of-the-art ""Anywhere Augmentation"" system.",,,
1235,"Exploring the Therapeutic Effects of Entertainment Media: Toward the ""Prescription"" of Media-Based Positive Psychology Interventions","Chronic psychological stress has deleterious effects on health and wellness; yet, positive emotions can combat this negative influence. Researchers have begun to design and test positive psychology interventions aimed at improving health and well- being and incorporate the promotion of positive emotions into stress reduction programs. Yet, entertainment media is largely absent from intervention design despite its capacity to evoke powerful emotional experiences. This dissertation builds on media effects and emotion literatures to address three key questions concerning the viability, design, and effectiveness of media-based positive psychology interventions. First, can specific types of media content generate discrete positive emotions? Second, what is the influence of these discrete positive emotional experiences on affective, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes? Third, what are the processes by these effects occur? In a four-wave panel experiment, undergraduates (N = 248) were randomly assigned into one of three media treatment groups, where they viewed one online video clip a day for a total of five consecutive days, or a control group, wherein they viewed no media. Those in the treatment groups either viewed a set of comedy clips, a set of clips portraying stories of underdog characters struggling to achieve goals, or a set of clips featuring nature content. Psychological states, coping strategies, physical and psychological well-being, and goals were measured 1-7 days before, 1-3 days following, and 10-12 days after the intervention. Additionally, measures of stress, emotion, motivation, and reactions to the characters were assessed after each clip. Results demonstrate that: 1) comedy generated amusement, underdog videos were evocative of hope, and nature maintained a calm emotional state comparable to baseline emotion; 2) all media conditions reduced psychological stress, negative emotion, and symptoms of illness, and increased life satisfaction; 3) comedy was most facilitative of personal resource development over time; 4) underdog videos generated the strongest motivation, endorsement of approach coping strategies, and effort exerted toward goals; and 5) emotion jumpstarted goal pursuit, whereas over time, cognitive factors maintained goal-oriented effort. Discussion is offered in terms of theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and areas for future research.",,,
1236,Toward a Model of Collaborative Action Research as a Form of Professional Development for Elementary School Teachers: An Inquiry,"Although research suggests that professional development for teachers should be contained within a coherent system, recent research indicates that professional development for teachers continues to be provided through workshops of short duration with little or no follow-up and sustained support (Guskey & Yoon, 2009; Kose, 2007). Instead, teachers should be engaging in the thinking that fosters further change in behaviors and practices and the collaboration that builds a professional culture that focuses on student learning (Collinson, Kozina, Lin, Ling, Matheson, & Newcombe et al., 2009; Loucks-Horsley & Matsumoto, 1999). This study examines how Action Research might be used to provide professional learning opportunities that are systemic, continuous, relevant, and collaborative, as well as opportunities that are tailored to address the different professional growth needs of teachers. By exploring the perspectives of participants who engaged in Action Research, this study addressed the following questions: What are the personal characteristics of teachers interested in participating in Action Research? What school and district conditions could support the participation of teachers in Action Research? How might Action Research be used to provide differentiated professional learning opportunities? Data collected through a survey, interviews, and document reviews are examined and compared with previous studies. The major focus of the study centers on interviews conducted in one California elementary school where the staff engaged in components of collaborative action research during their school's implementation of a comprehensive literacy instructional program. Although the majority of the survey respondents were interested in participating in Action Research, and the interview participants recognized the value of their research process in simultaneously facilitating their professional growth and their instructional program implementation, this study revealed the need to maintain a balance between a unified focus of professional development and differentiated support for teachers. With consideration given to the limited nature of the study and its effect on the subsequent implications, the researcher ends her work with a discussion of the research process as a tool for professional growth, instructional program implementation, and school improvement.",,,
1237,Querying Patterns in High-Dimensional Heterogenous Datasets,"The recent technological advancements have led to the availability of a plethora of heterogenous datasets, e.g., images tagged with geo-location and descriptive keywords. An object in these datasets is described by a set of high-dimensional feature vectors. For example, a keyword-tagged image is represented by a color-histogram and a word-histogram. Analyzing these datasets gives better insights into the processes generating the datasets, opens new frontiers of scientific research, and fuels development of life-changing products. An effective mechanism for exploring these heterogenous datasets is querying. One such kind of query is a pattern query. Given a heterogenous dataset and a query, the task here is to find a set of objects which are constrained by a relationship and satisfy the query. For example, given a dataset of keyword-tagged objects, a useful pattern query is to find a set of similar objects that contains a given set of keywords. Querying patterns in high-dimensional heterogenous datasets brings about a new set of computational challenges. High performance algorithms to efficiently and accurately query patterns are presented in this thesis. First, a scalable algorithm, SIMP, is described for accurately querying near neighbors in a high-dimensional dataset. SIMP significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques. Next, a novel algorithm, ProMiSH, is proposed for efficiently querying patterns by keywords. ProMiSH has a speed-up of more than four orders over the state-of-the-art techniques. Then, an algorithm, QUIP, is described for querying patterns by example in a spatial dataset, e.g., geographical maps. QUIP offers an improvement of 87% in running time over the baseline approach. Next, an algorithm for querying patterns by example in a temporal dataset is described. It specifically solves the problem of finding duplicate videos. The proposed algorithm yields a practical query time for video duplicate detection. Finally, a scalable method to compute statistical significance of results of a multi-object query is discussed. Statistical significance or p-value provides a more useful criterion for ranking the results of a query.",,,
1238,Field-based Simulations for Directed Self-Assembly of Polymeric Systems,"The self-assembly of block copolymer thin films has attracted considerable attention as a promising high resolution lithographic tool due to its scale of microdomain ordering and its facility for modulation of both size and pattern. Our research has focused on developing improved block copolymer lithography techniques by means of self-consistent field theory (SCFT) simulations. We have demonstrated that directed self-assembly (DSA), which has already been shown to improve long-range ordering, can also be used to dictate the configuration and fidelity of the self-assembled structure. We demonstrate that lateral confinement combined with homopolymer additive can stabilize non-natural square arrays of microdomain ordering that are not found in pure block copolymer systems. Furthermore, we have shown that DSA can be used for high resolution VIA (Vertical Interconnect Access) lithography since it enhances the processing window through its reduced size variation and rectification properties. We also have developed a powerful suite of field-based computer simulation tools for exploring the self-assembly of complex polymeric fluids under confinement including a Chebyshev-based pseudo-spectral approach and a model that can incoporate deformable polymer/air interfaces. Finally, we have extended SCFT DSA techniques to mixed polymer brushes, in which dissimilar A and B chains phase separate on molecular length scales due to constraints imposed by having their ends grafted to a substrate. We identified the phase diagram of mixed brushes in the melt and demonstrated that lateral confinement and grafting density modulation can induce technologically attractive lateral phase separation for the application of self-assembled mixed polymer brushes in next-generation information storage and electronic devices.",,,
1239,Assessment and Emphasis of Parent-Effective Strategies in Parent Training for Children with Autism: An Exploratory Study,"Parent training programs have been consistently documented in the literature to have positive effects on a wide variety of targeted behaviors in children, such that parent education is now widely acknowledged as a ""best practice"" in the treatment of children with autism. Research has also begun to assess how to most effectively deliver such training in these programs. For example, collaborative partnerships and a strength-based approach in parent training programs have both been found to positively affect parent-child interactions. In addition, literature on ""contextual fit"" of intervention programs for families of children with disabilities provides important directions for the field of parent education. To extend research in this area, the purpose of the current study was to assess parent training techniques which incorporate effective strategies that parents might already be using as part of their repertoire to target language development with their children. Using a multiple baseline design, this study examined the effects of emphasizing parent-effective strategies in parent training on parents' fidelity of implementation of intervention procedures, child responding, observed parent and child affect, parent confidence, parent stress, and parent playfulness. While the results of this study were not conclusive, they suggest a number of important directions for future research. Specifically, the results indicate that each parent possessed identifiable effective strategies which they were using with their children, and that the use of such strategies was able to be prompted during parent training. Results are discussed in terms of implications for parent education programs, parent well-being, and parent child-interactions.",,,
1240,Ultra-Compact Integrated Coherent Receiver for High Linearity RF Photonic Links,"Radio frequency (RF) photonic links employing phase modulation can exhibit high dynamic range provided the received RF signal can be linearly demodulated. The linearity of conventional interferometer based coherent receivers is limited by their sinusoidal response. A balanced receiver with negative feedback to a reference tracking modulator is developed in this work. In order to achieve high linearity, the tracking modulator is used to reduce the net phase swing across the demodulator such that the interferometer response is restricted to its linear regime without penalty to the signal to noise ratio (SNR). In order to achieve linear phase tracking at high frequencies, high loop gain and loop bandwidth are required. This means the physical delay of the feedback loop must be suciently short enough to prevent loop instability at higher frequencies. Monolithic integration of the receiver components is thus used to realize a compact receiver architecture. In this work, a monolithically integrated coherent receiver with negative feedback to suppress the nonlinearity arising from phase modulation has been successfully demonstrated. The photonic integrated circuit (PIC) consists of an ultracompact frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) trench coupler integrated with multiple quantum well (MQW) reference phase modulators and a balanced unitravelling carrier (UTC) photodetector pair. The trench coupler contributes less than 1 micron to the optical path length, and is shown to exhibit 50:50 splitting. The compactness allows a device geometry that enables flip chip hybrid integration of the PIC with an electronic integrated circuit (EIC) that contains the transconductance amplifier and filter for the feedback loop. Use of the ultra-compact trench and the flip chip integration reduces the loop delay to _10 ps. The resultant 3-dB bandwidth of the receiver was measured to be 1.5 GHz. The shot-noise limited SFDR at 300 MHz is 123 dB  Hz2/3.",,,
1241,Development of Dearomatization Chemistry for the Total Syntheses of Sesquiterpene Natural Products,"The synthesis of biologically active molecules derived from natural sources is of primary interest to national health. Furthermore, numerous families of these natural products contain common structural motifs that would greatly benefit from the use of general methods for their construction. A large number of these compounds are derived from or contain aromatic functionality. Due to the large feedstock of aromatic materials that are commercially available and their structural similarity to interesting natural products, our group has focused on the development of methods for the dearomatization and/or functionalization of aromatic motifs. The structurally complex materials derived from these manipulations are further elaborated to provide practical routes to several natural products. The first part of this dissertation focuses on the development of a synthetic route to verify the biosynthesis of the eight-membered ethereal ring in the helianane family. Our attempts to provide a biomimetic approach ultimately led to the discovery of a structural misassignment and complete repudiation of the helianane family. A new procedure for the generation and consumption of ortho-quinone methides was developed to avoid side-reactions that plagued specific aromatic substrates. The second part describes the development of an oxidative dearomatization-induced [5 + 2] cycloaddition reaction and its application to the synthesis of three natural products. The creation of this novel cascade reaction allowed for construction of the densely functionalized tricyclic skeleton of the cedrenoid family from a simple aromatic precursor.",,,
1242,From Single Molecules to Networks: Studying Biopolymers with Magnetic Tweezers,"To understand polymers, the fundamental building blocks of our lives, both social and biological, will not only fulfill the intellectual curiosity of scientists, but more importantly help us to have a better 'life'. So it is not surprising that to understand the physical properties of polymers and polymer networks has long been a major goal of most basic and applied science and engineering disciplines. However, it has been difficult to associate polymer theories directly to experimental data. While many polymer theories only describe the motion of individual polymer chains or small polymer networks, traditional polymer experiments measure the behavior of polymers that averaged over a huge number of molecules (109--1023). This thesis focuses on the development of techniques to visualize and to manipulate single DNA molecules and biopolymer networks. These techniques allow us to directly test single polymer dynamics measurements against polymer theories and to understand the structure-mechanics relationships in polymer networks.",,,
1243,The regulation and enzymatic properties of the human DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A),"DNA methylation is a critical epigenetic modification controlling transcriptional regulation in mammals. New 5-methylcytosine (5mC) patterns are created by DNMT3A and the closely related DNMT3B, but the mechanisms that control their activity and genomic site selection is not understood. To understand how DNA methylation patterns are created, the enzymatic properties of DNMT3A were determined and it was examined how they are regulated by homo- and hetero-protein complexes, environmental conditions (pH), DNA topology, and noncoding RNA. First, DNMT3A was probed to determine its ability to methylate multiple sites before dissociating from the DNA. Using chase assays and mathematical modeling, DNMT3A was shown to methylate human promoters processively. Processive methylation was also enhanced by the catalytically inactive homolog DNMT3L and modulated by DNA topology. Processive de novo DNA methylation would provide a mechanism for transcriptional regulation and silencing of newly integrated viral DNA. The ability of DNMT3A to be processive is due to oligomerization at both the dimer and termer interfaces; shown by testing single amino acid mutations, including those implicated in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), at the homotetramer, homodimer, and DNMT3A:DNMT3L heterotetramer interfaces. A model for the DNMT3A homotetramer was developed via computational interface scanning and tested using light scattering and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Distinct oligomeric states were functionally characterized using fluorescence anisotropy and steady state kinetics. Replacement of residues that result in DNMT3A dimers, including those identified in AML patients, show minor changes in methylation activity but lose the capacity for processive catalysis on multisite DNA substrates, unlike the processive wild type enzyme. The dimer interface of DNMT3A is also dynamic and changes with protein concentration, DNA, tetramer interface occupation, DNMT3L, pH, and somatic mutations. Our results are consistent with the bimodal distribution of DNA methylation in vivo and provide a possible mechanism that accounts for the changes in methylation patterns that are observed in AML patients with DNMT3A mutations that may contribute to oncogenesis and its progression. Lastly, two modes of RNA regulation is observed in vitro, including RNA binding allosterically and causing no change in catalysis and another RNA molecule that binds tightly to the catalytic domain in a structurally dependent fashion and causing potent inhibition.",,,
1244,I. Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Couplings in Water Facilitated by Nonionic Amphiphiles II. Room Temperature C-H Activation Catalyzed by Cationic Palladium,"Palladium-catalyzed cross-couplings have emerged as one of the most efficient approaches to carbon-carbon bond formation in modern organic chemistry. Even with several decades of study, however, a variety of avenues for improvement in terms of reaction scope and both environmental and synthetic efficiency remain. Among the most widely used transformations in this class is the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of halides or pseudohalides and boronic acid derivatives. Although these reactions are primarily carried out in wet organic solvent, use of water alone as a reaction medium yields a number of advantages in terms of cost, safety, and minimization of organic waste. Small amounts of nanomicelle-forming nonanionic amphiphiles were found to facilitate efficient Suzuki-Miyaura couplings in water, usually at room temperature. A variety of challenging substrate classes were found to be amenable to these conditions, including electron-rich aryl chlorides, pseudohalides, and highly lipophilic substrates. The conditions have been further extended to include valuable heteroaryl halides and boronic acids as coupling partners. With the additional promise of increased synthetic efficiency that it provides, the direct fuctionalization of carbon-hydrogen bonds through transition metal-catalyzed ""C-H activation"" chemistry has recently generated considerable interest. Previously reported conditions to achieve direct reactions at aromatic C-H positions have generally required harsh conditions, including high temperatures to achieve direct reactions at these positions, often resulting in limitations in substrate scope and selectivity. Cationic palladium catalysts were found to be highly active in promoting C-H activation reactions of aryl ureas at ambient temperatures, leading to some of the mildest conditions yet reported for transformations in this class. Room temperature ortho -arylations were carried out using aryl iodides in water, while aryl boronic acids could be coupled in EtOAc, also at ambient temperatures. Conditions for room temperature Fujiwara-Moritani couplings between aryl ureas and acrylate derivatives were also developed. Studies aimed at better understanding the reaction conditions and mechanism were conducted, and a possible palladacycle intermediate was isolated and characterized by X-ray crystallography.",,,
1245,"Dracunculiasis: The Endgame, Proximity, and Risk","Guinea worm (Dracunculiasis) is a two-host, nematode parasite that is currently the focus of an international eradication effort. The remaining few of these parasites live in sub-Saharan and Sahelian Africa in the countries of Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, and South Sudan. By the end of 2010 there were fewer than 1,800 cases of Guinea worm reported worldwide, an astonishing decrease from the estimated 3.5 million reported cases in 1980 when the international eradication effort began. There is no vaccine or preventative medicine to inoculate against the parasite and the eradication effort has focused on an educational program, teaching those at risk how to prevent infection. Through education and community programs to improve access to clean and safe drinking water, it is hoped that the parasite will have been eliminated from the waters worldwide in the near future. The goal of this research is to understand how Guinea worm has reemerged in regions where it had once been eliminated. A current hurdle to the eradication effort is to supervise the regions where Guinea worm once existed to ensure there is no reemergence. There have been several incidents of reemergence in the past and the work for this dissertation examines historical data on Guinea worm reemergence to better understand the process and identify the most suitable methods for locating regions at risk for reemergence. Results of this analysis show that specific transportation networks and medical facilities may play a role in determining the spread of Guinea worm as it reestablishes itself in a region. This work reiterates that both disease transmission and species abundance are fundamentally spatial processes and that the incorporation of spatial approaches provides new insights into the nature of Guinea worm reemergence. The techniques presented in this dissertation have many potential applications in health geography, spatial epidemiology, and spatial analysis.",,,
1246,Structure-Function-Property Relationships in Solution-Processed Diketopyrrolopyrrole-Based Bulk Heterojunction Solar Cells,"This dissertation is concerned with the material properties of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based conjugated molecules and their application in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) type solar cells. Relationships between the molecular structures and material properties are investigated, allowing molecules to be tailored to achieve desired characteristics. Density functional theory is used to model the properties of compounds before they are synthesized and identify compounds which are likely to have desirable properties. A variety of materials are synthesized, including dithieno DPP derivatives, a diphenyl DPP derivative and several bis-DPP compounds. Their physical properties are characterized by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. Properties of films and mixtures with acceptors including fullerene and Vinazene(TM) derivatives are also examined, including their surface morphologies and charge carrier mobilities. The role of cohesive energy densities in film formation is examined. Processing conditions are optimized for the fabrication of BHJ solar cells, yielding devices with good efficiencies. In general, we find that DPP-based conjugated oligomers make an excellent platform for the design of BHJ solar cells.",,,
1247,Integrative modeling of genomics datasets,"The advent and continual progression of technologies for profiling DNA variation, RNA transcription, and protein abundance have fueled the respective fields of genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. These parallel advancements pave the way for integrative modeling of multiple, heterogeneous data sources, with the important goal of providing holistic models of cellular physiology. Indeed, as these rich sources of information provide immense potential to model biological processes and learn the genetic architectures for complex phenotypes, the onus falls on computational scientists to develop methodologies that provide hypotheses to guide experimentation. In this dissertation, we present three computational methodologies that integrate multiple data sources for the following purposes: predicting synthetic lethal interactions between two genes, causal network reconstruction, and association mapping by sampling mixed models.",,,
1248,The Emergence of Tiwanaku: Domestic Practices and Regional Traditions at Khonkho Wankane and Kk'arana,"The emergence of first generation states is among anthropology's most enduring points of research. Such a state emerged around A.D. 500 in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin, at Tiwanaku. This state shares many characteristics with other early states, but the process of its formation was distinct. Traditional state origins models do not adequately explain the preceding centuries, when there was an unprecedented historical rupture in social organization. This dissertation follows a perspective of emergent practice, which locates the cause and production of social change in practices, traditions, and interactions, from which social groups and institutions emerge. This perspective outlines general processes of social change, while detailed genealogies of practices are necessary to document specific historical trajectories. During the Late Formative, the southern Lake Titicaca Basin was dotted with ceremonial centers with earthen mounds, sunken temples, carved monoliths, and residences. These centers and their communities were larger and qualitatively different than anything prior, but little is known about their builders, residents, and visitors. Residents' domestic practices at Khonkho Wankane and Kk'arana, Tiwanaku provide data on the social groups that formed the communities at each site. Residents shared many cultural practices and traditions. Walled compounds were home to large, powerful social groups. There is little evidence of status differences, trade specialization, or competition. The fundamental process to increasing complexity was organizing gatherings and work-parties, which framed dense networks of interactions. Residents hosted events in walled, outdoor spaces, and served food or drink in red-rimmed Kalasasaya small jars and bowls. The populations of these ceremonial centers was relatively low, and temporary visitors were recruited, generating labor forces that built many large construction projects. Interactions at these centers generated large communities focused at ceremonial centers, and were central to the emergence of the state at Tiwanaku. Despite this radical change in social organization, many domestic practices and traditions first established during the Late Formative would be continually reproduced for hundreds of years.",,,
1249,Interaction Methods for Large Scale Graph Visualization Systems --- Using Manipulation to Aid Discovery,"The amount of structured data available in our digital age is constantly growing and this calls for ways to analyze this data. One way for such analysis is through visualization, and structured data can typically be visualized as node-link graphs. Many tools are available for visualization of such node-link graphs. These tools often suffer from scalability issues, but more importantly they don't offer meaningful interaction mechanisms for the user to explore the data. This dissertation work attempts to address both of these issues, by providing and evaluating scalable and useful interaction methods for graph visualization systems. Our work mainly focuses on what we call manipulation methods, which are a set of interaction methods that enable the user to interactively manipulate the layout of a node-link graph. We provide a survey of existing interaction methods and introduce our own methods. Methods range from more specialized techniques, such as for an interactive visual recommender system, to more general procedures, which can be applied to any node-link data. We demonstrate the benefits of these interaction methods over pre-existing methods, and we also show the benefits of manipulation methods in general over visualizations that don't allow layout manipulation.",,,
1250,"Marshall Plan Films in Italy, 1948--1955: Cinema as Soft Power","My dissertation examines US government sponsored information films produced in and for Italy, by Italians, from 1948 to 1955, under the auspices of the European Recovery Program (ERP), commonly known as the Marshall Plan (MP). This corpus of 200+ films, created at a critical moment in the development of mass media propaganda, has received little more than a footnote in standard historical accounts of international documentary cinema and post World War II US and Italian foreign policy. This understudied body of films negotiated complex political and ideological terrain in both Italy and the US, producing multiple narratives of history, civic discourse and cultural identity that challenge the meta-narrative of economic productivity and progress the US government intended these films to promote. Examining the MP films' integration into the larger social fabric of postwar Italy, at the moment of their initial production, reveals that these films were indeed constitutive of diplomatic practices, having the power to not simply represent diplomatic settlements, but to shape diplomatic institutions and practices as they were occurring. Examining the archive of MP films that remains today also reveals their functions as sources of knowledge and commodities that persist in both imagining and making tangible specific modes of cinematic assemblage, consumption and reception. This study charts the course of a transnational visual information campaign that could not have functioned so successfully had the US or Italy attempted to launch the campaign independently.",,,
1251,In the House: Audiences and the Origins of the Theatrical Contract,"In the first half of the nineteenth century, audience behavior changed to allow for the twentieth and twenty-first century theatrical contract. Though typically discussed in terms of psychological orientation -- i.e. the observance of a ""fourth wall"" or the willing suspension of disbelief -- today's theatrical contract relies on behavioral conventions observed by the audience. The development of these behavioral conventions was not inevitable, nor was it the natural result of ""civilizing"" impulses or a changing playhouse demographic. Rather, as the history of the empowered and unruly audiences of the eighteenth century shows, the transition away from treating the theater as a site of lively social interaction toward attending the theater to engage in sociably silent inner reflection originated in the changing desires of the spectators. For most of (at least ""Western"") history, the theater has been a site of real-time negotiations --- between spectator and theater maker, not to mention spectator and spectator -- about whose will would govern the playhouse. These negotiations, particularly evident when spectators rioted to repel attempted infringements upon what they perceived as their theatrical rights, reveal an eighteenth century notion of theatrical citizenship, which brought with it the rights, privileges, and obligations of a de facto social contract. As the notion of theatrical citizenship developed, so, too, did the audience's sense of itself as an audience -- that is, spectators came to see themselves as a community gathered primarily for the purpose of listening to and observing what transpired onstage.",,,
1252,Catalytic Conversion of Woody Biomass to Small Molecules,"Efficient methodologies for converting lignocellulosic biomass to replacements for or blends with gasoline, diesel, and/or jet fuel have the potential to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions while providing economic impetus for the expanded production of low-cost herbaceous and woody solids. Quantitative catalytic conversion of wood and cellulose to liquid and gaseous products in a single stage reactor operating at 300--350 C and 160--220 atm is described. Little or no char is formed in the reactions. The reaction medium is supercritical methanol and the catalyst, copper supported on earth-abundant metal oxides, is inexpensive and easily prepared. The major liquid product is a mixture of C2--C6 aliphatic alcohols and methyl ether derivatives thereof, which are in principle suitable for use as a blend with, or replacement for, gasoline. General background, model studies, and a mechanistic hypothesis accounting for the conversion of high molecular weight polymers to low-boiling molecular entities are presented.",,,
1253,Object Tracking and Searching in Distributed Camera Networks,"Technological advances have created new opportunities in distributed camera networks. One of the main challenges is effective utilization of network-wide knowledge given the constraint of limited network bandwidth and camera node computations. This dissertation addresses the challenge and proposes novel approaches for two basic vision tasks: (1) object tracking and (2) object browsing and searching. Object tracking is formulated as a global Bayesian estimation problem solved through a distributed Monte-Carlo sampling implementation. At each camera, a particle filter tracker with discriminative appearance model is utilized for image plane tracking. Two novel distributed active fusion schemes are proposed to facilitate camera collaboration. An online jointly-learned discriminative model is used for enforcing appearance consistency by weighting particles from the local tracker. Then object's ground plane motion consistency is enforced by correcting local tracker's particles that deviate from the ground plane estimate from information shared across cameras. The proposed method enables an efficient closed loop interaction between object's local tracking module and the global fusion schemes for robust tracking. Experimental results verify the efficacy of the methodology. For object browsing/search, we propose a distributed architecture to assist human image analysts to effectively browse and search for objects in a camera network. In contrast to existing approaches that focus on finding global trajectories across cameras, the proposed approach directly models the relationship among raw camera observations. A graph model is proposed to represent tracked objects, their appearance and spatial-temporal relationships. To minimize communication requirements, raw video is processed at camera nodes independently to compute object identities and trajectories at video rate. However, this would result in unreliable object locations and/or trajectories. The proposed graph model captures the uncertainty in these observations by modeling their global relationships, and enables users to query, browse and search the data collected from the network. A graph ranking framework is proposed for the search and retrieval task, and the absorbing random walk algorithm is adapted to retrieve a representative and diverse set of video frames in response to a user query. Experimental results on a wide area camera network are presented.",,,
1254,Multi-Output Multi-Modal Parts-Based Regression for High Dimensional Data with Low Sample Size,"It is generally hypothesized that there are significant differences in the structural anatomy of the brains of normal people when compared to those who are diagnosed as psychopaths, yet very little quantitative data exists. This research addresses various computer vision and medical imaging applications, mainly focusing on the problem of correlating clinically assigned psychopathic scores (called PCL-R scores) with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans of the subjects. We propose a novel data-driven parts-based regression algorithm for the analysis of such cross-sectional anatomical data. The method helps capture and localize biologically significant parts in the brain exhibiting regression with respect to the associated clinical variable. This analysis is further extended to the case of functional MRI brain scans wherein we present a new multi-modal regression method to capture the correlating anatomical parts between the modalities that are undergoing changes due to the clinical variable. Finally, a formulation of the regression method is provided to learn the complex relationship between each data modality and multiple clinical labels associated with them.",,,
1255,Artificial Natures: Creating Nature-Like Aesthetic Experiences through Immersive Artificial Life Worlds,"In the last two decades, the field of Artificial-Life Art (A-Life Art) has addressed new approaches to creating art based on the synthesis of life-like phenomena. At the same time, there has been increasing interest and experimentation in creating immersive environments as virtual worlds or ""worldmaking"". As a combination of both, this dissertation proposes the name ""artificial natures"" to describe a novel form of installation art: computational artworks of complex systems creating worlds with their own physics and biology, within immersive, interactive environments. It constructs nature-like aesthetic experiences using the mechanisms and evolutionary processes of life in order to express generative creativity and emergent beauty. The motivation is to construct an aesthetic unity in which art, science, play, and life integrate into a single fulfilled experience akin to childhood memories of playing in nature; ludic investigation considered as an infinite game. As a contemporary art practice, it is not based on a refutation of past art practice but on free production and expression of our current and future times. Choosing an holistic approach, this research is a reciprocal engagement of concept, theory, and art practice based on a trans-disciplinary implementation, seeking a reconciliation between subjective beauty (artificial) and objective truth (nature). The thesis documents a theoretical approach to artificial natures as a general form of art, and the researching and production of a series of Artificial Nature artworks as a vehicle by which to critically and practically examine its requirements, key concepts, challenges, techniques, and opportunities.",,,
1256,Welfare Tradeoff Ratios and Emotions: Psychological Foundations of Human Reciprocity,"Much human cooperation is based on some form of reciprocity --- the contingent exchange of benefits. For reciprocal altruism to evolve and be stable, cooperators must be able to exclude cheaters and cooperate only with those likely to reciprocate. However, the informational problem of distinguishing between cheaters and cooperators presents a challenging problem for a social agent. This dissertation investigates the proposal that human reciprocity is based not on the amount of benefits received, but on social valuation --- the willingness to trade off one's own welfare for the sake of another's welfare. The human mind contains mechanisms that regulate one's valuation of the welfare of others, and mechanisms to estimate the extent to which others value one's own welfare. Because valuation predicts the delivery of benefits, the more another individual values my welfare, the more valuable he/she is to me. The process of calibrating social valuation is mediated in part by emotions: gratitude in response to cues of high valuation by others and anger in response to low valuation. I test the predictions of this model, and show the following results. (1) When subjects are paired up with each other and given tradeoff decisions, subjects reciprocate each others' willingness to trade off money for their partner. (2) Subjects' respond not to the amount of benefits they receive, but to their partner's willingness to sacrifice their own benefits for the subject. (3) Anger and gratitude mediate subjects' responses to cues of valuation in theoretically predicted ways. (4) People are more grateful for a benefit, and more willing to reciprocate, when it is targeted at benefiting them specifically as an individual than when it is not so specifically targeted. (5) Cross culturally, people share common intuitions about what causes anger and what arguments assuage anger, and these are based on cues of social valuation. These results show that the human mind contains mechanisms that are acutely sensitive to cues indicating the weight that other individuals place on one's welfare, using these cues to regulate one's own valuation of the welfare of other individuals.",,,
1257,"Spectroscopic Studies of Azide compounds: Thermochemistry, Chemical Kinetics and Photodissociation Dynamics","Some of the most difficult chemical systems, either to observe or produce in significant quantities, are polynitrogen molecules. One example of this type of molecules in the early stages of investigation is cyclic-N3, whose molecular geometry and promising technological applications have attracted our attention to define optimal experimental conditions for being photoproduced. High-resolution synchrotron-radiation-based Photoionization Mass Spectrometry (PIMS) was applied to study the dissociative photoionization of three azide precursors for cyclic-N3; chlorine azide (ClN3), hydrogen azide (HN3), and methyl azide (CH3N3). In our attempts to detect cyclic-N3, the thermochemistry derived in the PIMS studies stimulated our work to perform photodissociation dynamics experiments of CH3N3 at 193 nm using Photofragment Translational Spectroscopy (PTS) with electron impact (EI) detection under collision-free conditions, and chemical kinetic studies based on Infrared Spectroscopy (IR) in matrix-isolated ices formed from rare gases (Argon, Nitrogen and Xenon). PTS experiments lead us to derive the branching ratio between reactions CH 3+N3 (radical channel) vs CH3N+N2 (molecular channel), and to conclude that cyclic-N3 is the dominant product in the radical channel. In contrast, in the matrix isolation experiments we found no evidence of the radical channel, possibly due to barrier-less recombination. However, since no mechanistic reports of methyl azide dissociation exist at these conditions, these studies could have significant implications for future experiments addressed to detect cylic-N3 under matrix environments.",,,
1258,Compassionate Bodies: Allies for Border Justice on the Migrant Trail,"This study examines The Migrant Trail walk in the context of social movement theory and argues for the importance of the body. The Migrant Trail is a week-long, 75 mile walk taken annually by border justice activists at the U.S.-Mexico Border. Its understood purpose as a social movement tactic is to protest border policies that lead to migrant deaths, raise awareness of the crisis of death on the border, and mourn those who have lost their lives. This study utilizes surveys and in-depth interviews to explore what the Migrant Trail achieves for the participants actually undertaking the walk. On the Migrant Trail, embodied experience complements the fact that participants are movement allies rather than direct beneficiaries of the border justice cause. It is argued that embodied experience builds compassion, solidifies commitment and creates a strong sense of collective identity amongst walkers. Moreover, these effects are highlighted as being of particular importance because of the specific challenges that allies face fitting into a social movement context.",,,
1259,"The Soviet Union and Formation of the Grand Alliance: Soviet Foreign Policy in Cooperation and Conflict with the Western Powers, 1941-1943","This dissertation examines Soviet foreign policy from the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June of 1941 to December of 1943. It is the first comprehensive study this period, which had been neglected in historiography of international relations during the Second World War. Specifically, this work explores such subjects as the nature of Soviet foreign policy under Stalin, origins of the Grand Alliance between the USSR with the western powers as well as the Soviet Union's role in the context of the global struggle of World War II. This dissertation examines these themes from a perspective of international history. Extensive use of primary sources gathered from archives in Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States allows providing new, more nuanced evaluations of subjects under analysis. Specifically, this work concludes that Soviet foreign policy under Stalin operated on the basis of power politics, with considerations of the balance of power and security being paramount for Soviet policymakers. Soviet diplomats during the Second World War more often resembled practitioners of Realpolitik than revolutionary ideologues. Their practical analysis of international relations, however, was conditioned by an ideological Leninist model that often skewed their interpretation of political developments. Additionally, this study finds that the Soviet Union played an important role in the global conduct of the war. Not only was it heavily involved in the war in Europe, but it was also a significant factor in the struggle between the Allies and the Axis in the Far East. This does not mean, however that the Soviet Union was a fully-fledged member of the Grand Alliance from the beginning of its participation in the war. This dissertation argues that the Soviets and the western powers formed a tenuous association until 1943, fighting largely separate wars and being preoccupied with divergent political interests. By the end of 1943, however, the Soviet Union became a full partner in the wartime coalition, participating in formulation of common military strategy and plans for establishment of a new world order on equal footing with Great Britain and the United States.",,,
1260,Enhancing Current Practices in Risk Assessment for Youth Offending: A Two-Part Study,"Study 1: Describing Youth Offenders in Terms of Hope and Grit. Juvenile justice researchers and practitioners have not yet followed other social science disciplines and shifted their paradigm to a perspective based in mental wellness and positive psychology. To further understand the role of mental wellness as a protective factor associated with desisting from delinquency, this study investigated the presence of positive psychological traits of hope and grit (i.e., perseverance) within a youth offender population (N = 186). Due to differences in developmental trajectories for delinquency across gender, gender differences were examined; however, no significant differences were found. Results indicated that youth offenders had significantly lower levels of self-reported hope and grit when compared to other youth populations. In addition, a moderately low correlation between hope and risk for recidivism was observed. However, no significant differences were found between youth offender grit and a normative population, and grit was not significantly correlated with risk for recidivism. Implications for theory, research, and applied practice are discussed. Keywords: positive psychology, youth offenders, hope, grit, gender. Study 2: Enhancing Current Practices in Risk Assessment for Youth Offending. Based on resiliency theory, assessing for both risk and protective factors is necessary to identify individual outcomes; however, information regarding protective factors against recidivism for juvenile offenders is limited. In addition, empirically-supported self-reported dynamic traits of hostility and emotional regulation have not yet been incorporated into risk assessment. In a sample of 189 youth offenders, this study examined self-reported hostility, emotional regulation, hope, and grit in relation to six-month recidivism. Youth offender self-reported hostility, emotional regulation, hope, and grit yielded small- to medium-sized effects differentiating six-month recidivists from nonrecidivists, with hostility being the strongest (d = 0.50) and most consistent predictor of recidivism. This study also modeled youth self-reported hostility, emotional regulation, hope, and grit with hierarchical logistical regression while controlling for broader ecological risk factors to predict six-month recidivism. Results indicated self-reported hostility was the only significant predictor for six-month recidivism. Keywords: youth offenders, hostility, emotional regulation, hope, grit, recidivism, risk assessment.",,,
1261,Wide-Band Low Noise Quadrature VCO in CMOS SOI,"This thesis presents a wide-band, low phase noise, low power Quadrature Voltage Controlled Oscillator (QVCO) designed in 0.18um CMOS Silicon on Insulator (SOI) technology. The 2.4 GHz ISM band QVCO achieves -124 dBc/Hz phase noise at 1MHz offset, 25% tuning range and 2.4mW power consumption under 1.1V supply. The SOI technology facilitates the design of high performance LC-VCO. High substrate resistance of SOI enables the fabrication of high Q on-chip inductor, which significantly improves VCO's phase noise performance. Moreover, an accumulation-mode (AMOS) varactor with reduced junction parasitic in SOI widens the VCO's tuning range. The Ring Injection Locked Frequency Divider (Ring-ILFD) demonstrates its wide locking range and low power consumption in high speed application. A combination of multiple injection and direct injection technique is used in this design to further enhance the locking range. The ILFD generates quadrature signal by halving the core VCO's output while strictly following its phase noise performance.",,,
1262,"Black and White Memory Making in Postwar Natchez, Mississippi, 1865--1935","Nearly seventy years after the Civil War, Natchez, Mississippi, sold itself to Depression-era tourists as a place ""Where the Old South Still Lives."" Tourists from thirty-seven states flocked to view the town's decaying antebellum mansions, hoop-skirted hostesses, and a pageant saturated in sentimental Lost Cause imagery. Organized by the town's female garden club, the Pilgrimage created a popular culture experience that appealed to the tastes of 1930s tourists. All that was missing was Scarlett O'Hara herself. This dissertation analyzes how the selective white historical memories of a small Southern community originated from the experiences and hardships of the Civil War, changed over time, and culminated in a successful heritage tourism enterprise still in business today. This project also examines the ways in which Natchez African Americans worked to create a distinctive post-emancipation identity that challenged the dominant white historical memory. Although black public historical traditions in Natchez eroded far more quickly than in other Southern towns, this dissertation reveals how a vibrant postwar African American community helped to keep these memories alive. This dissertation builds on earlier scholarship in showing that historical memory is neither monolithic nor static, but an ongoing fluid process shaped and reshaped by memory makers, their audiences and an array of cultural, economic and political forces unique to a particular community. In the course of revealing how historical memory evolved in Natchez, this project contributes new insights on the periodization of Lost Cause ideology, the gendering of historical memory, and the role of fraternal and martial associations in crafting a postwar Southern masculine identity. The legacy of Natchez's collective historical memories---black and white---raises important questions about the impact of such selective historical memories on a nation and its people. Relying on a rich body of textual and visual sources, this study considers not only the meaning of being white and black in the late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Jim Crow South, but also the ways in which members of one black community crafted their own collective narratives of the past.",,,
1263,Defensores de la Patria: Mexico's Army and the Nineteenth-Century Creation of the Mexican Nation,"This dissertation examines the early stages in the creation of the Mexican nation, particularly how its creators, both officials and ""common people,"" looked at the Aztec past, colonial period, and independence insurgency (1810-1821) to piece together the nation and produce Mexican identity. I argue that due to the militarization of the country during the wars of independence, and the significant role given to the military by Mexico's constitutions of 1824 and 1836 as the protector of the patria and its independence, the Mexican army was vital in the nation's formation. By analyzing the military's structure and its role in the creation of Mexico, this study also sheds light on the composition of Mexican society in the early nineteenth century.",,,
1264,Queen Catherine of Braganza as St. Catherine: Picturing Piety and Female Agency at the Restoration Court,"My thesis examines Jacob Huysmans's portrait of Queen Catherine of Braganza as St. Catherine, a portrait that can be categorized as strikingly dissimilar from its precedents and contemporaries. The portrait is unusual in the manner in which the Queen's pose, hairstyle, gesture and gaze appear to belong in an image of a saint, rather than a portrait. Together, these elements create a performative portrait historiae of such theatricality that the Queen can be said to embody the role of her name saint, rather than pose with attributes. Through this embodiment and the employment of traditional Catholic iconography, the St. Catherine role portrait establishes an identity for the Queen, one which I argue presents her as a pious Catholic. The first section of my thesis looks at how the challenges faced by Queen Catherine, together with contemporary reports of her unattractive appearance, have shaped past and present literature on her reign. My examination of her historiography focuses on how these circumstances, particularly Anti-Catholicism and her rivalry with King Charles II's mistresses, have defined the popular image of Queen Catherine. Unlike the image of the barren, unpopular and fervently religious Queen that these texts propagate, the visual analysis of the St. Catherine role portrait that follows demonstrates how Queen Catherine fashioned her own identity. The second half of my thesis looks at the St. Catherine portrait through its referents to Catholic iconography, particularly the Queen's saintly gaze and the compositional importance given to the saint's spiked wheel. These similarities are made clear especially when compared to images of St. Catherine and the Magdalen. Peter Lely's portrait of Barbara Villiers as St. Catherine demonstrates not only the rivalry in place when the Queen ascended the throne, but the comparative religiosity of the Queen's portrait. Also taken into consideration is the place of St. Catherine in the program of the Queen's public imagery, which included portrait medals, prints and the John Dryden play Tyrannick Love. Through these diverse sources, a picture emerges of precisely how, in such adverse conditions, Queen Catherine of Braganza forged a public identity of Catholic piety.",,,
1265,Tailoring peptide amphiphiles and their assemblies for biomedical applications,"Peptide amphiphiles (PAs) are molecules composed of a peptide conjugated to a hydrophobic moiety, commonly a fatty acid. They closely resemble the structure of naturally occurring lipopeptides, produced by microbes as signaling and antimicrobial agents. The amphiphilic nature of PAs in concert with the large number of discovered functional peptides inspired scientists to exploit this molecular architecture for producing synthetic self-assembled bioactive materials. PA assemblies are sought after for a wide breadth of applications including disease therapy, regenerative medicine, and catalysis. However, with PAs, the peptide chemistry is a double-edged sword. The peptide component contributes significantly to both the activity and self-assembly. The physiochemical properties of different PAs lead to unique aggregation stability and morphological characteristics which are unpredictable, a priori. Therefore it is challenging to design bioactive PAs and control their self-assembly, simultaneously. This limitation slows the development of PAs for medical use. In this dissertation, methods to control the self-assembly of PAs and the effects of acylating a functional peptide will be discussed. In one part, efforts to direct the self-assembly of PAs into small spherical aggregates, a morphology infrequently observed, will be described. In another section, a strategy to control the stability of PA assemblies will be discussed. In the last section, a pH-responsive membrane perturbing peptide was modified with fatty acid tails and the properties of the resulting PAs will be presented. This dissertation provides some fundamental insight for the use and design of PA self-assemblies.",,,
1266,Elucidation of the Molecular Structure of an Alkane Dehydrogenation Component of the Tandem Alkane Metathesis Cycle,"Alkane metathesis is a potentially useful, industrially important catalytic cycle in which an alkane dehydrogenation catalyst and an olefin metathesis catalyst work, in tandem, to disproportionate saturated hydrocarbons. An alkane dehydrogenation catalyst of interest for this process is a Pt-based heterogeneous organometallic precursor for nanoparticle synthesis. Current catalysts in the tandem system suffer from low turnovers, as well as catalyst deactivation. The use of Pt(C5H9)2 supported on silica as a precursor for controlled formation of subnanometer particles is investigated. NMR, IR, DFT, and XAS spectroscopies, as well as elemental analysis were used to probe the structure of Pt(C5H9)2 after it is grafted to silica surface. The organoplatinum precursor has shown to undergo protonolysis on both pentenyl ligands forming a (SiO) 2Pt(C5H10)2 surface site. XAS and TEM have also shown that small particles are formed after reduction in H 2 gas.",,,
1267,"The Wheels of Titan: Faith, the Future, and the American Frontier","This dissertation explores the way in which scientifically accurate representations of outer space--presented in popular American magazines such as Life and Collier's---in the decade after World War II advanced public support of space research. In particular, it examines the influence of the space paintings of Chesley Bonestell, an architect-turned-special effects artist, whose paintings of Saturn premiered in the May 29, 1944, issue of Life. Bonestell's paintings provide an entree into the larger question of how science can be affected by the religious proclivities of the culture from which that science comes. For the purpose of this dissertation, the answer to that question lies in the myth of the American frontier, and the way in which religio-cultural values developed to support nineteenth century American expansion---which also contributed to the cultural myth that arose around that expansion---were re-appropriated by Americans during the Cold War. The central chapters of the dissertation trace the history of the space movement between 1946 and 1958, and follow the career of Chesley Bonestell, a man with a gift for being in the right place at the right time. This history begins with his collaborative partnership with rocket expert Willy Ley on several articles and eventually a book, The Conquest of Space (1949). It then moves to Bonestell's work on the 1950 science fiction film classic Destination Moon. The final two chapters explore Bonestell's collaboration with Wernher von Braun and other scientists, artists, and engineers, who together created plans for American space exploration in 1951. Their plans were published in Collier's and later released as a series of books. These plans included schematics for a space station in 1951, a ""moon shot"" in 1953, and a trip to Mars in 1956. In this dissertation, all of these events are read in light of the myth of the American frontier on Cold War religion and culture, and the way in which what mid-century sociologist Will Herberg called ""the American Way of Life"" influenced the both the science and the spirit of space boosterism throughout the 1950s.",,,
1268,Glenn Beck and the Mainstreaming of the Mormons: An Example of Laurence Moore's Outsider-to-Insider Paradigm,"The 2008 election season brought a new fame to the otherwise ignored Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The presidential campaign of Mitt Romney and the Church's tireless efforts in passing Proposition 8 in California showed signs of a more energized, aggressive involvement of the Saints within public political discourse. However, from the beginning it was clear there was ambivalence from Evangelicals and other Protestant Christians in aligning with them in support of both causes. Glenn Beck's rise in the media from 2008 to the present marks an unprecedented national mainstreaming of a peculiar brand of religious political conservatism rooted in, and once isolated to, the Mormon culture that traditionally existed in the margins. Beck, a Mormon convert, successfully created a popular narrative for political change buttressed by his Mormon ideology but was packaged for an Evangelical Christian audience. Paradoxically, Beck employs rhetoric where the principles that have historically cast the Mormons as religious ""outsiders"" are now the points that are serving to unify Mormons with mainstream Christians today. That is to say, Beck's influence on the Tea Party infuses a particularly Mormon characteristic within the framework of contemporary conservatism, the consequence of which is profound. This thesis will examine, first, the principles of the Mormon faith that serve as points of unity between Mormons and Evangelicals, namely, the doctrines of restoration, revelation, and eternal family. Then, a close examination of Beck in his various media (television, radio, public rallies, and books) reveals the overt Mormon message that is instilled within his ideology even as it is re-framed in terms more acceptable to non-Mormon conservatives. Finally, I address the timeliness of Beck's popularity, and how the mainstreaming of the Mormons comes out of an affinity with a growing rhetoric of persecution from conservative Christians. I focus on rhetoric of Beck to understand how the Mormons have influenced and affected the broad scope of conservatism, which suggests the historical distinction made between Mormons and Evangelicals is merely pretense.",,,
1269,Homeland Insecurity: Comparing How American Christian Identity Militants and American Al-Qaeda Activists Perceive the United States and Their Respective Theological Justifications for Violence,"This study examines in-depth the perceptions in which American Christian Identity Militants and American Al-Qaeda Activists view the United States as well as their respective theological justifications for violence. The primary methodology is a comparison of religious activist beliefs related to the Christian Identity movement and to Al-Qaeda within the United States. The research was conducted through an analysis of a purposive sample of case studies. The subjects of this study were chosen based on the following criteria: Theological persuasion, historical activist nature, prior recognition of the group or individual as a terrorist or charged with a terrorist-related offense, availability of information, and U.S. citizenship-status. Throughout this dissertation, the perspectives and ideas derived from the theoretical frameworks of social identity theory and sociotheology will explore the ways in which these individuals and groups relate to the larger social structure within which they act. Moreover, sociotheology, by examining each group's ""epistemic worldview,"" aims to explain how the Christian Identity-related activists and Al-Qaeda extremists religiously justify their violence towards the United States, given that their perceptions of America are colored by their respective religious understandings of social reality. This research illustrates the symmetry between Christian Identity militants and Al-Qaeda activists. Specifically, their shared set of perceived enemies, which involves both concepts, and persons, including Jewish people, the United States, race-mixing, ethnic diversity, as well as the shared belief that they must shield their own peoples from the corrupting influence of foreign cultures and the homogenizing juggernaut of globalization, are surprisingly similar in viewpoint and scope. Additionally, members of both groups profess to promote beliefs similar to those in mainstream Christianity and Islam, respectively. Furthermore, the belief that God's law is superior to that of man is held in common by the Christian Identity movement and Al-Qaeda as is the glorification of violence as a regenerative force. Finally, both are willing to slaughter innocents in the name of creating a new social order. I also offer policy options to help governments better prepare for and respond to the security threats faced by religious activists groups within their own borders, with especial attention to the United States.",,,
1270,"Spatial Patterns of Water Insecurity in a Developing City: Lessons from Accra, Ghana","Intraurban differentials in safe drinking water in developing cities have been exacerbated by rapid population growth that exceeds expansion of local water infrastructure. In Accra, Ghana, municipal water is rationed to meet demand, and the gap in water services is increasingly being filled by private water vendors selling packaged ""sachet"" water. Private sector sale of sachet water has grown to fill an important gap in household water security, and consumption of sachet water has been on the rise in West Africa over the last decade. Sachets extend drinking water coverage deeper into low-income areas and alleviate the need for safe water storage. This potentially introduces a health benefit over stored tap water, but at an additional cost both financially and environmentally. The long-term implications of these changing consumption patterns remain unclear. This work begins by reviewing recent shifts in drinking water sources from recent Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys, as well as the history, economics, quality, and regulation of sachet water in Ghana's Accra-Tema Metropolitan Area. It proceeds to explore correlates of using sachets as the primary drinking water source for two large samples of women drawn from separate household surveys in Accra, and investigates links between sachet water and reported diarrhea episodes in a subset of children under five. Within Accra's slums, neighborhood water rationing and lower socioeconomic status tend to increase a household's likelihood of buying sachet water, and sachet customers tend to be the poorest of the poor. Sachet use is also associated with higher levels of self-reported overall health in women, and lower likelihood of diarrhea in children. More broadly, after controlling for all socioeconomic groups in Accra, sachet use is associated with younger age, lower overall health, and neighborhood water rationing. Sachet water consumption also seems to have transitioned from an initial luxury good of the rich to a widespread phenomenon of the urban poor between 2008 and 2010. Given the pros and cons of sachet water, a more holistic understanding of the drinking water landscape is necessary for municipal planning and sustainable drinking water provision.",,,
1271,"Stats Geeks: Sabermetrics, Baseball Fans, and the Struggle over Masculinity","My dissertation examines a new form of fandom, the advanced statistical analysis of professional American baseball. These fans, called Sabermetricians use advanced statistical techniques to analyze baseball players and strategies. This analysis, known as Sabermetrics allows these fans to develop an identity as experts which provide them with a cache of cultural capital. However, their conclusions also alienate them from the baseball establishment, as their conclusions often run counter to the conventional wisdom of baseball. The disagreement over how to analyze baseball caused a public crisis in baseball as well known figures openly criticized the work of Sabermetricians. This debate about the legitimacy of this new knowledge and what it means for how consumers of culture participate in the production of culture makes Sabermetricians and Sabermetrics a compelling subject for sociological inquiry. My research focuses on both the individual Sabermetricians and the conflict between Sabermetricians and the baseball establishment. Using interviews with 46 Sabermetricians, baseball franchise executives, and baseball journalists, my study seeks to understand the how and why this unique fan movement emerged, and how Sabermetricians make meaning in their own lives and make new knowledge that they hope to be integrated into existing thought. My project will also examine the strategies that these actors use to deal with the tension that their identity as ""stats geeks"" creates within their own lives as they interact with the various actors in the realm of sports fandom. My findings highlight the importance of competing discourses of masculinity in structuring the proceses of how knowledge creation as well as how knowledge is debated, and used in maintaining position within the masculine hierarchy of sports. This work refines the current work and offers new insights to the study of popular culture, fandom, sports, and masculinity.",,,
1272,Synthesis and Characterization of Novel Conjugated Materials for Organic Electronics,"Shaping new materials that are tailored to meet the specific electronic, chemical, and physical demands in their applications --- this is the role of the materials chemist. Although the field of organic electronics has witnessed significant advances since its inception, the toolkit of efficacious materials has been entrusted to a few choice molecular platforms. In an effort to expand this limited library of compounds, new materials based on various polycyclic hydrocarbons have been synthesized and characterized. The pigment quinacridone was incorporated into water/alcohol-soluble electron transport layers that were deposited on top of existing organic-soluble active layers in organic light-emitting diodes and organic photovoltaics, thereby enhancing the transport of electrons and hence the device efficiencies. A strained polycyclic hydrocarbon, decacyclene, was functionalized with three imide groups to generate a new class of non-fullerene acceptors for organic photovoltaics. A heteroheptacene, dinaphthocarbazole, was characterized for its hole transporting properties in organic field-effect transistors. Finally, various substituted imidazolium-based ionic liquids were synthesized and characterized for their potential use as organic electrolytes in lithium batteries.",,,
1273,D. Luisa de Gusmao: Gender and Power in Seventeenth Century Portugal,"This thesis explores the relationship between gender norms and political power in seventeenth century Portugal through the regency of Queen D. Luisa de Gusmao (1656-1662). It discusses D. Luisa's use of the proscribed gender roles of the seventeenth century in order to gain political stability at court, which enabled her to conduct diplomatic relations with other European powers. Her actions are analyzed and compared against the accepted gender roles of the time to show that she manipulated the men around her by over-emphasizing the female stereotype, leading them to believe that she was behaving in manners that were expected of her as a queen regent and mother. Instead, she used this as a cover to achieve her own agenda and fix some of the mistakes made by her late husband, D. Joao IV. The end result was a victory in their war against Spain, and the continuance of Portuguese independence after a brief Iberian Union (1580-1640). This fits one more piece into the puzzle of women's history, especially in relation to the power of the queen regent. It also adds to the scholarship of this period, one that has until recently been mostly neglected by Portuguese historians.",,,
1275,Palladium-Substituted Perovskite Catalysts for Automotive Exhaust Emission Control,"The incorporation of Pd into crystalline complex oxide hosts (e.g., perovskite oxides) facilitates structure characterization and the direct comparison of experiment with theory. The low surface areas of perovskites, a result of their high-temperature synthesis, do not preclude high catalytic activity, and their high thermodynamic stability may be a significant advantage. Pd-substituted BaCeO3 catalyst shows much higher turnover frequency for CO oxidation than conventional catalysts, such as Pd/Al2O3. The high mobility of perovskite lattice (surface and bulk) oxygen, caused by the increased vacancy concentration associated with the presence of square-planar Pd(II) in the bulk, is the key to promoting oxidation reactions at surface Pd(II) sites. The CO oxidation mechanism is highly dependent on the ratio of CO and O2. When O2 is present in excess, the kinetics show CO inhibition, consistent with a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. When O 2 is limiting, the reaction orders for both CO and O2 show a strong dependence on P(CO)/P(O2), and eventually become independent of both P(CO) and P(O2) at high P(CO). This suggests a new, BaCeO3-mediated mechanism which dominates at high P(CO)/P(O2). The oxidation of soot catalyzed by Pd-substituted BaCeO3 further implies that the lattice oxygen is the important oxygen source for oxidation reactions. The isotopic study of soot oxidation shows that most of the active oxygen species are obtained from the labile lattice oxygen, instead of the gaseous O2. The oxygen vacancies generated in depletion of lattice oxygen can be immediately refilled by gaseous O2 through simple heteroexchange. Pd-substituted BaCeO3 is a superior alternative to the most studied NSR catalyst, described as a Pt/Rh/BaO/Al2O3, which is vulnerable to sintering and sulfur poisoning. Both BaO and CeO 2 are stabilized against deactivation when combined as BaCeO3, and Pd is present as cationic active sites for NOx reduction instead of metallic nanoparticles. NOx is stored on the catalyst as Ba(NO 3)2 with partial loss of the perovskite structure, and released as N2 by reduction with CO. The structure of Pd-substituted BaCeO 3 is readily re-formed upon heating to around 800 C. Despite its low surface area (3.7 m2/g), BaCe0.9Pd0.1O 2.9 displays a very high NOx storage capacity (NSC), 1220 &mgr;mol/g. The Pd-substituted perovskite is also an excellent NOx storage-reduction (NSR) catalyst. Using CO as the reductant, the NOx conversion of fresh BaCe0.9Pd0.1O2.9 is comparable to that of a typical benchmark catalyst, 1%Pt-20%Ba/Al2O3, in the temperature range 250-600 C. Besides gas reactions, Pd-substituted BaCeO3 was found to be very active in Suzuki coupling (TOF ca. 50,000) and produce very low levels of residual Pd (< 0.05 ppm) in the reaction medium. The oxidative forms of the catalyst showed higher activity than the reduced form, because of the inaccessibility of the Pd(0). The catalyst exhibited little decline in activity after being recycled seven times, suggesting that perovskite may recapture Pd(II) from the reaction medium.",,,
1276,Developments of New Reactions in Enolate Chemistry Inspired by the Total Synthesis of Bioactive Marine Natural Products,"Marine natural products have long served as leading compounds for new therapeutic agents; however, their utilization is often extremely limited due to poor availability from their natural sources. Therefore, exploration of new synthetic techniques offers shortcuts in the production of such agents and the opportunity to improve the current state of the art. Studies directed toward the synthesis of these biologically active marine natural products inspire the development of new, efficient, economical, and environmentally friendly methods that are broadly useful for the synthesis of new pharmaceuticals and organic compounds for medicinal research. The development of a wide range of new and exciting chemical transformations revolving around the rich chemistry of enolates is described. Specifically these studies include: 1) a stereoselective enolization of alpha-branched esters, 2) a diastereoselective Ireland-Claisen rearrangement, 3) the stereoselective formation of quaternary stereocenters, and 4) an asymmetric alkylation. Additionally, the total synthesis of the marine natural products (+)-pinnatoxin A and (+)-pinnatoxin G will be discussed in detail. The diastereoselective Ireland-Claisen rearrangement is a featured method for the stereoselective installation of the quaternary stereocenter in the pinnatoxins and other related spiroimine natural products.",,,
1277,Solution Structure and Kinetic Characteristics of a Complex of the Histidine Auto Kinase CheA with its Substrate CheY,"Motile bacteria have the tendency to swim toward the attractant and away from the repellent, the behavior known as chemotaxis. The binding of such molecules by the membrane-bound chemoreceptor results in the modulation of the autophosphorylation activity of CheA, the central kinase in the bacterial chemotactic signaling system. Phosphorylated CheA transfers its phosphoryl group to its cognate response regulators CheY and CheB, which respectively control the direction of flagellar rotation and the level of receptor adaptation, both of which in concert determine the chemotactic response of the cell to the incoming signal. In this work, we used modern NMR techniques to construct a model for the interaction of the E. coli CheA phosphotransfer domain (P1 domain) and the response regulator CheY in the presence of the CheY-binding domain of CheA, P2. We also investigated the kinetics of phosphotransfer between the P1domain and CheY by stopped-flow fluorescence measurements to further understand the role of the P2 domain and the linker connecting P1 and P2. Our structural model indicates that the presence of P2, a domain dedicated to binding to the response regulator, leads to a different relative orientation between the phosphotransfer domain and the response regulator from those seen in homologous complex structures previously determined in the absence of a domain equivalent to P2. The kinetics results show that the presence of P2 domain linked to P1 enhances phosphotransfer rate compared the rate by the isolated P1, while the unlinked P2 domain, by itself, is inhibitory to the phosphotransfer. In addition, we obtained evidence that the length of the linker may have been optimized for the phosphorylation of P1 by the kinase domain, P4. Our work contributes to a finer understanding of how these proteins are designed and fine-tuned to meet the biological demand of chemotaxis signaling.",,,
1278,An Examination of CMOS Aging in Integrated Circuits and Novel Aging Detection Techniques for SRAM Cells,"This thesis work examines the problem of CMOS aging in VLSI integrated circuits. In nanoscale technologies, Negative and Positive Bias Temperature Instability causes an increase over time in the absolute value of the threshold voltage of PMOS and NMOS transistors which results in degraded circuit performance. Current methods to detect and compensate for aging in both digital and combinational logic and memory arrays are presented in this work. My own research contribution in the field of SRAM aging detection is then described. Modifications to standard 6T SRAM cells create a built in sensor which can detect effects of Bias Temperature Instability on the NMOS and PMOS transistors of an SRAM cell. The proposed design allows for a check process, which can observe an increase in transistor threshold voltage as a result of aging effects directly in a cell which is actually used as a memory unit. The proposed modifications allow for detections of aging while having a minimized impact on area and performance of a standard 6T SRAM cell.",,,
1279,Biomaterial design for specific cellular interactions: Role of surface functionalization and geometric features,"The areas of drug delivery and tissue engineering have experienced extraordinary growth in recent years with the application of engineering principles and their potential to support and improve the field of medicine. The tremendous progress in nanotechnology and biotechnology has lead to this explosion of research and development in biomedical applications. Biomaterials can now be engineered at a nanoscale and their specific interactions with the biological tissues can be modulated. Various design parameters are being established and researched for design of drug-delivery carriers and scaffolds to be implanted into humans. Nanoparticles made from versatile biomaterial can deliver both small-molecule drugs and various classes of bio-macromolecules, such as proteins and oligonucleotides. Similarly in the field of tissue engineering, current approaches emphasize nanoscale control of cell behavior by mimicking the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) unlike, traditional scaffolds. Drug delivery and tissue engineering are closely connected fields and both of these applications require materials with exceptional physical, chemical, biological, and biomechanical properties to provide superior therapy. In the current study the surface functionalization and the geometric features of the biomaterials has been explored. In particular, a synthetic surface for culture of human embryonic stem cells has been developed, demonstrating the importance of surface functionalization in maintaining the pluripotency of hESCs. In the second study, the geometric features of the drug delivery carriers are investigated and the polymeric nanoneedles mediated cellular permeabilization and direct cytoplasmic delivery is reported. In the third study, the combined effect of surface functionalization and geometric modification of carriers for vascular targeting is enunciated. These studies illustrate how the biomaterials can be designed to achieve various cellular behaviors and control the interactions with cells in vivo .",,,
1280,Personal Control and Perceptions of Causation in News Headlines,"How do people interpret ostensibly causal information? The present research investigates the relation of personal control and belief in a just world to causal judgments of real world news headlines and articles. College student participants viewed headlines of varying causality (e.g., ""Recession causes increase in teen dating violence"") with short article excerpts and then rated their perception of the causality of the variables from that headline (e.g., ""Does recession cause an increase in teen dating violence?""). Results suggest personal control is a motivational factor influencing perceptions of causality, and belief in a just world is an individual difference associated with perceptions of causality. In Study 1, participants who reported that powerful others more determined their life outcomes gave lower ratings of causality, and belief in a just world was associated with increased perceptions of causality. In Study 2, personal control was primed experimentally and the belief in a just world relationship was replicated. In both studies, results are presented for the perceived believability of the headline/article pairs and the relationship between both outcome variables and individual difference measures. Implications and future directions are given for the study of perceptions of causality.",,,
1281,Feature-independent neural coding of target detection during search of natural scenes,"Visual search requires humans to detect a great variety of target objects in scenes cluttered by other objects or the natural environment. It is unknown whether the brain contains a general purpose detection mechanism to code the presence of a wide variety of categories of objects embedded in natural scenes. We provide evidence for a feature-independent coding mechanism for detecting behaviorally relevant targets in natural scenes in the dorsal frontoparietal network. Pattern classifier using data from single-trial fMRI activity in the dorsal frontoparietal network reliably predicted the presence of 384 different target objects and also the observer's choices. IPS activity correlated with observers' decision confidence and with the task-difficulty of individual images. These results could not be explained based on physical differences across images or eye-movements. Thus, the dorsal frontoparietal network detects behaviorally relevant targets in natural scenes independent of the defining visual features and is akin to the priority map in monkey lateral intra-parietal cortex.",,,
1282,Querying and Mining Chemical Databases for Drug Discovery,"Drug discovery and development has exploded into a multi-billion dollar industry. Unfortunately, despite a steady increase in pharmaceutical research, the number of new drugs discovered has been, at best, flat. The low productivity of current approaches to drug discovery has been ascribed to a number of factors including limited focus to a single protein target and undesirable effects, such as toxicity, that are discovered too late in the discovery process. In this dissertation, I propose strategies to combat the low productivity of current drug-discovery techniques and show that by integrating the principles of statistical significance and diversity into the molecular analysis framework, we can accelerate the drug discovery rate. In the first part of my thesis, I explore the importance of mining statistically significant patterns from large collections of scientific data and demonstrate their utility in drug discovery. I show that over-represented subgraphs in molecular databases are correlated with biological activity and can be used to learn accurate classification models. Furthermore, statistically significant pharmacophoric patterns can be employed to predict the binding mechanisms between small molecules and protein targets. Finally, I show that mining discriminative subgraphs from protein-protein interaction networks allows us to learn the complex network-encoded logic functions that decide the clinical outcomes of diseases. In the second part of my thesis, I explore the importance of structural diversity in top-k queries, and develop index structures to answer such queries in a scalable manner. First, I explore the importance of modeling attractive and repulsive dimensions in molecular analysis and demonstrate their utility in going beyond traditional similarity or distance measures. Next, I show that diversity-aware top-k answer sets are informationally denser than traditional top-k answer sets. Overall, this thesis proposes core indexing and mining algorithms that extend the current state of the art in computer science research. Among the various applications of the developed algorithms, impact in the field of drug discovery acts as the unifying theme binding all of the chapters together. However, these methods are also applicable in other scientific domains such as software bug mining, analysis of communication graphs, social networks, sensor networks, and transportation networks.",,,
1283,Contact Dependent Growth Inhibition System of Uropathogenic Escherichia coli 536,"Bacteria utilize extracellular factors to interact with neighboring cells. Bacteria may secrete toxins that inhibit the growth of other bacteria in order to compete for nutrient and space availability. These signaling molecules can also modulate gene expression and surrounding cellular behavior. Signaling molecules act in long range signaling via secreted peptides and compounds, as in quorum sensing, or in the short range using extracellular proteins requiring contact to deliver their signal. Contact dependent growth inhibition (CDI) was originally discovered in an Escherichia coli strain that dominated the rat intestine. This strain, called EC93, was able to inhibit the growth of other laboratory strains of E. coli. CdiB and CdiA are essential for growth inhibition and an immunity protein confers protection to CDI. The CdiA C-terminus (CdiA-CT) encodes a toxin responsible for CDI. The outer membrane protein, BamA, and inner membrane drug pump, AcrB, are needed for target cell inhibition. CDI systems have been discovered in many species of bacteria, including uropathogenic E. coli 536 (UPEC 536). This dissertation covers several aspects of UPEC 536 CDI. The visualization of CdiA-CT peptide transfer into the cytoplasm of a target cell is shown for the first time. Although both the N-terminus (NT) and CT of CdiA are delivered to the surface of target cells, only CdiA-CT becomes intracellular. It is also demonstrated that the NT and the CT of CdiA are exposed on the surface of inhibitor cells. Mutations in both inhibitor cells and targets that affect inhibitory activity are then described. Attempts to make non-binding inhibitor and target cells are discussed. Unknown point mutants that are partially resistant to EC93 and UPEC 536 CDI are introduced. Point mutations in AcrB that may affect CdiA binding and/or transit of CdiA-CT are also shown. Furthermore, ClpXP and ClpAP protease expression in target cells is shown to be necessary for inhibition by UPEC 536. Finally, UPEC 536 inhibitors containing a CdiA-CT deletion and an inactive CdiA-CT mutant were found to be defective in early biofilm development.",,,
1284,These Are a Few of My Favorite Things: The Cultural Meaning of the Tree,"This dissertation analyzes the cultural meaning of the tree and the ways in which trees reflect and contribute to important discourses about nature and our relationship with the natural world. Although these discourses are often collectively identified as environmentalism, this all-encompassing term contains subtle but important differences that are occluded by the very language of environmentalism. The most important cultural ""location"" for this phenomenon is the tree, which is a metonym for nature. The tree, as representation, as idea, and as a physical organism, is deployed and understood in very different ways and for very different purposes. These differences are rendered invisible to many research methods because contemporary American culture treats trees with automatic hagiographic respect. Direct questioning, through survey research or traditional interviewing, will reveal only the superficial respect given to trees. More creative interview methods, along with a close reading of the way trees are treated in popular culture, reveal the divergent sensibilities that use arboreal language as a way to understand and give meaning to the relationship between humans and the physical world. Interviews were conducted in public urban and forested areas in California, Kansas, and New York and complemented by hermeneutic analysis of tree imagery in Christmas decorations, advertising, and landscape. Each interview revolved around the infamous 'If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?' question made popular by Barbara Walters. The methods, interviews and analysis employed reveal just how many faux-environmentalist sensibilities rely on the idea, image, and planting of trees. When the tree is worshiped, uncritically, as a balm for all the ills of the modern world, it denies ecological thinking. The romanticization of the tree is dangerous because it usurps trees from the plant kingdom and uses them to redecorate and remodel urban environments. Trees are a counter-narrative to modernity, but a failed counter-narrative, an evil detournement. Within these discourses, however, is another sensibility, suggesting ways that even a tree-based rhetoric can shift into a more holistic ecological approach that can eliminate the delineation of nature, as non-man, into a vision of an ecology that permeates the urban and rural Earth.",,,
1285,"Reproductive strategy, sexual signals, stress and immunity in two blackbird species: Relating variation in immune function to life-history strategies","Proper functioning of the immune system is critical to an organism's fitness, but the immune system is expensive to develop and maintain. Organisms thus have to balance the costs of parasites against the costs of immunity. I examined the relationships among immune function, corticosterone (CORT), reproductive strategy, sexual signals and stress in an avian brood-parasite, the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater: ""cowbird""), and its close non-parasitic relative, the red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus: ""redwing"") to understand how variation in immune function may reflect different life-history strategies. In chapter 1, I investigated the relationship between reproductive strategy and immunity in cowbirds and redwings during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. Female cowbirds had significantly reduced immune function compared to male cowbirds and female redwings during the breeding season, whereas there were no differences between these groups in the non-breeding season. Female redwings, in contrast, had significantly higher bactericidal capacity (BC) and similar swelling response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) compared to male redwings during the breeding season. In conjunction with previous work, these results suggest that female cowbirds trade off current condition as a result of their heavy investment in current reproduction. In chapters 2 and 3, I examined the relationships between static signals and immunity in male cowbirds and redwings. Both species exhibited a significant negative relationship between the signal (song repertoire size in cowbirds and epaulet size in redwings) and BC. In cowbirds, CORT was positively correlated with song repertoire size, but was not related to BC, whereas in redwings, CORT was not related to epaulet size but was positively correlated with BC. BC is likely modulated by activity levels and social feedback based on signal expression. In Chapter 4, I studied the effect of acute stress on the BC of cowbirds. Male cowbirds exhibit a significant decline in BC following handling stress and the administration of exogenous CORT without an associated stress event, whereas female cowbirds exhibited no change in BC following either treatment. Both CORT and corticosteroid binding globulins increased significantly following the non-stressful administration of CORT, and these increases were similar in males and females.",,,
1286,"Money Can't Buy You Class: Cultural Capital, Etiquette, and the White Wedding","As a data source, the etiquette book has long been viewed as a repository of information about social practices and values. Etiquette literature has played a pivotal role in defining normative behavior. Furthermore, within an American context, these texts have been advertised as a means for achieving social distinction, establishing cultural capital, and fostering upward mobility. This study focuses on both the production of the etiquette book, as well as on the ways in which the rules of etiquette are applied and enacted in the realm of social ritual---specifically, within the ritual of the American white wedding. Through analysis of twelve etiquette books from the decade of the 1920s, a period when both these texts and the white wedding surged in popularity, I argue that authors function as cultural arbiters, utilizing specific rhetorical devices to establish their authority and legitimate the larger project of etiquette itself. In addition, I analyze the ways in which wedding etiquette both reflect and shape dominant notions of class, gender, and social status. Studying both the wedding and etiquette in conjunction can allow us to identify the implicit power dynamics, systems of domination, and hegemonic ideals that form the basis and underpinnings of both social institutions, and allow us to critically interrogate their function with American society.",,,
1287,UAV Data Mule Vehicle Routing Problems In Sparse Sensor Networks,"Recent advances in technology have enabled to the use of wireless sensor networks for environmental monitoring and surveillance. Wireless sensor networks are particularly beneficial for monitoring environments that are unsuitable for human presence, such as those arising in the monitoring of permafrost, volcanos, forest fires, and battlefields. Mobile agents called data mules can be used to enhance sensor networks by visiting individual sensors to collect measurements. In this thesis, the mobility of the data collector is exploited to mitigate energy depletion of the stationary nodes and allow for sparse deployments at the cost of additional data latency. This motivates us to seek efficient strategies for the mobile vehicle in order to alleviate this data latency. The policies developed here apply directly to an acoustic source localization problem in which the objective is to localize the source of a transient acoustic event using measurements from a group of unattended ground sensors. First we study the optimal sensor placement of acoustic time of arrival sensors for localization using techniques from information theory and optimization. A sparse sensor configuration is shown to be optimal when maximizing the expected determinant of the Fisher information matrix for truncated, radially-symmetric source distributions. Next, we use ideas from optimal sensor placement and optimal sensor selection to adaptively adjust the route of the data mule to minimize the time to localize events of interest. When the data mule is a small fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), this algorithm can be improved by including the kinematic constraints of the UAV and exploring the ability of the UAV to communicate with faraway sensors within its line of sight. Finally, we provide data mule routing policies for acoustic source localization over a large area involving many sources and sensors and analyze their performance.",,,
1288,The Tonology of Itoman Okinawan: A Phonological Analysis of the Nominal Tone System,"Itoman, one of the varieties spoken in the southern part of Okinawa Island, exhibits several tone patterns. Although the tone patterns of Itoman were examined in previous studies (Nakasone ms., Hattori 1959, Oshiro 1963, and Hirayama et al. 1966), they ended at the descriptive level, and no phonological accounts for the surface tone patterns were provided. Focusing on the nominal tone patterns, this study provides both phonetic and phonological accounts of the tone patterns of Itoman. To account for the tone patterns both phonetically and phonologically, I collected audio data during three fieldwork trips to Okinawa. Based on the analysis of the data, I found the following tone patterns: (i) falling, (ii) plateau with fall in a ga-form, (iii) plateau, and (iv) concave. In the autosegmental framework, I propose ten rules and their subrules, which systematically explain the four tone patterns of both monomorphemic and polymorphemic nouns.",,,
1289,Host Adaptation and Hypervirulence Among Emerging Bacterial Pathogens,"Infectious diseases continue to endanger global health with over 25% of world deaths attributed to communicable diseases. The ongoing trend towards globalization, coupled with the emergence of novel pathogens that are associated with an increased incidence and severity of disease, further exacerbates the risk of rapidly disseminating and potentially fatal infections. Salmonella species are endemically present throughout food and water supplies and pose a significant challenge to human and animal health as well as the livestock industry. Here we describe the potential role of the host in the emergence of new pathogenic strains, and its influence on the efficacy of antibiotics during infection. Analysis of a collection of Salmonella enterica human and animal isolates revealed that serovar Typhimurium human clinical isolates differed from animal isolates in both their maintenance of the Salmonella virulence plasmid (required for systemic virulence) and their ability to cause disease in mice, suggesting that Salmonella may experience specific host/niche selective pressures that result in human salmonellosis clinical isolates that are distinct from those of animal origin. Further characterization of Salmonella clinical isolates identified intraspecies variation in the ability to undergo pronounced increases in virulence during the infective process leading to the identification of hypervirulent Salmonella strains which are among the most virulent of the species. Adoption of the hypervirulent phenotype was rapid (and rapidly reversible) resulting in enhanced killing of both naive and vaccinated animals and was associated with increased cytotoxin production, host colonization and cytocidal activity. The mechanistic basis appears to be associated with altered virulence regulatory networks and metabolism coupled with the induction of an altered host immune cytokine response. To examine the influence of in vivo conditions on bacterial antibiotic resistance, salmonellae grown under conditions representative of the intracellular environment were challenged with clinically relevant antibiotics. Such conditions markedly altered the efficacy of trimethoprim resulting in high a level of bacterial resistance relative to that exhibited on laboratory medium. Molecular characterization of the diverse and dynamic survival strategies employed by salmonellae may lead to better approaches to the identification, prevention and treatment of emerging bacterial pathogens.",,,
1290,Development of Advanced Electrochemical Sensors for DNA Detection at the Point of Care,"In the post-genomic era, ever-advancing capabilities in DNA detection and analysis have become vital to the detection of infectious diseases and the diagnosis of genetic abnormalities and inheritable diseases. The benefit of such capabilities, however, has yet to reach patients outside of centralized facilities. There thus exists an increasing need to decentralize DNA detection methods and to administer such diagnostics at the ""point of care."" Electrochemical-based DNA sensors present a compelling approach, but have yet to deliver satisfactory sensitivity, specificity, miniaturization, and real-time monitoring capability to meet the demand of point-of-care diagnostics. Motivated by their potential and their current limitations, in this dissertation, we present a series of strategies that we have undertaken in order to address the key shortcomings of electrochemical DNA sensors and advance them toward point-of-care applications. First, we report a single-step, single reagent, label-free, isothermal electrochemical DNA sensor based on the phenomenon of enzyme catalyzed target recycling amplification. Using this technique, we achieve improved detection limit in comparison to hybridization-based sensors without amplification. We also demonstrate greater than 16-fold amplification of signal at low target concentrations. Next, we present a novel electrochemical DNA sensor that detects single-nucleotide mismatched targets with unprecedented ""polarity-switching"" responses. This ""bipolar"" sensor employs a surface-bound and redox-modified (methylene blue) DNA probe architecture, and outputs a decreased Faradaic current when hybridized to a perfectly matched (PM) target, but conversely reports an increased Faradaic current when hybridized to a single-base mismatched (SM) target. Third, we describe the microfluidic electrochemical dynamic allele specific hybridization (microE-DASH) platform for versatile and rapid detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Implementing electrochemical-based melting curve analysis within the microfluidic device, this platform directly detects PCR amplicon-like targets and distinguishes perfectly matched target from single-base mismatched target and heterozygote combination of both targets in 20 minutes. Finally, we present the microfluidic electrochemical quantitative loop-mediated isothermal amplification (MEQ-LAMP) platform for rapid, sensitive, and quantitative detection of pathogen genomic DNA at the point of care. DNA amplification is electrochemically monitored in real time within a monolithic microfluidic device, enabling the detection of as few as 16 copies of Salmonella genomic DNA via a single-step process in under an hour.",,,
1291,The evanescence of perfection: Exploring the lietmotif of retroactive minimalism in al-Juwayni's political thought,"The lacuna of authority created with the collapse of government is a difficulty that is seldom addressed in Islamic political writings. Overwhelmingly, Islamic political writings either focus on issues of statecraft, such as found in the works of al-Mawardi (d. 450/1058) and al-Baqillani (d. 402/ 1013), or focus on advice for king as enunciated by Ibn al-Muqaffa (d. 139/756) and Niz&dotbelow;am al-Mulk (d. 485/1092). All of these writings presuppose a continuity of the state and thus do not offer any solutions for a weakened state that is precipitously tending towards collapse. However, one theologian and jurist, Abu Ma'ili al-Juwayni (d. 478/1085) undertakes this precise issue in his political treatise al-Ghiyath al-Umam (Savior of the Nations). Using al-Ghiyath al-Umam as an exposition of his political ideology, this study aims to elucidate both al-Juwayni's pronouncements on the role and objective of the Islamic community in the absence of government, and more generally, al-Juwayni's notion of politics that enables the continuity of coherent societal structures irrespective of the absence of government. What emerges from this close textual analysis is that although al-Juwayni constructs certain ideals with regards to government, he is willing to renege on certain criteria based on context and stability which preclude their fulfillment. As a result, al-Juwayni focuses less on specific rules and regulations with regards to government and focuses more on political values. The values which are central to his philosophy are allegiance, stability and cooperation, and all three work in tandem to create a legitimate state structure. By separating political values from politics proper, al-Juwayni is able to legitimize the absence of government by embodying his political virtues in a variety of social and religious institutions which continue. The result is that al-Juwayni's political thought, while offering a window into the historical context in which he is writing, is able to transcend his time to continue to be relevant in modern society.",,,
1292,"Time, Space and Delinquent Worlds in Four Cervantine Novellas: ""Rinconete y Cortadillo"", ""La ilustre fregona"", ""El Casamiento enganoso"", ""El coloquio de los perros""","This dissertation discusses the role of delinquency in four of Cervantes' Novelas ejemplares: Rinconete y Cortadillo, La ilustre fregona, El casamiento enganoso and El coloquio de los perros. The study's goals are 1): using Bakhtin's theory of the chronotope to establish various common uses of Time and Space related to delinquency in all four of the novellas to establish a Cervantine Chronotope of Delinquency, and 2): using a chronotopic analysis of the novellas to identify an exemplary message common to all four of them. Delinquency in this study is defined according to contemporary precepts. A delinquent is in fact someone who breaks the law, in the widest possible sense, i.e. secular or religious law (i.e. someone who acts against accepted moral precepts, a sinner, is also a delinquent in these terms). Immoral behavior, for instance seduction in general was punishable by law for both noble and commoner alike within the Spanish civil law of the time. Four common aspects of Time & Space related to delinquency were found: 1. Time: Everyday Time, Age, Decisive Points in Time and Apprenticeship. 2. Space: Social Status, Legitimizing Space, Apprenticeship, and Movement away from Delinquent Spaces. Furthermore, a common exemplary message was also found: free will is necessary to the redemption from a delinquent life, but a redeemed delinquent is not guaranteed a blessed life in perpetuity. One must continuously exercise free will to choose not to return to a reprobate's life.",,,
1293,Defectivity in Laterally Confined Lamella-Forming Diblock Copolymers: Thermodynamic and Kinetic Aspects,"We use self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to study the directed self-assembly of laterally confined diblock copolymers. We focus on systems where the self-assembled lamellae are oriented parallel to the selective sidewalls of the channel. While well-ordered, perfect lamellae are observed in narrow channels both experimentally and numerically, undesirable defective structures also emerge. We therefore investigate the energetics of two isolated defects, dislocations and disclinations, for various segregation strengths and channel dimensions and establish conditions that favor the formation of defects. We also determine the energy barrier and the transition path between the defective and perfect state using the string method. In the case of transitions from defective to well-ordered states, we found that only a few kT of energy is necessary to overcome the kinetic barrier and suppress the defect, sharply contrasting with the large gain in free energy (many tens of kT) that is necessary for the formation of the defect from the pristine state.",,,
1294,Fiction and Ordinary Heroes in the Service of the Nation A Cultural History of the French Resistance,"This interdisciplinary dissertation explores the intricate relationship between French cultural production, from 1940 to the present day, on the one hand, and the documented history of the French Resistance (1940-1944) on the other. This study examines the extent to which cinema, literature and television have impacted our understanding, or, more precisely, our ""vision"" of the Occupation years. This project thus investigates what fictions tell us about the lens(es) through which France has regarded her recent past, and demonstrates in the pathway of Pierre Nora how their sum constitutes ""a place of memory."" In studying the resilience of the last great French national myth and its evolution, this dissertation considers the democratization of the hero (male and female) in postwar fictions to determine to what degree certain stories contribute to the making of history and the shaping of national identity. As cultural mediums of all sorts consistently interact with one another, they contribute, through different means, to the same rehistoricizing and mythologizing process. This project thus offers a vision both panoramic and detailed on the topic at hand: it takes into consideration fictional representations of the French Resistance from a historical and literary point of view, and offers case studies of those deemed most influential. Chapter one offers to situate the cultural production under study as part of a ""national narrative"" dating back to the France's defeat to a coalition of German states in 1870. Chapter two explores the literary production of the Occupation subsequent to her defeat to Germany in 1940, which was to sow the seeds of a myth of a dignified nation united against a common enemy that was to blossom after the Liberation in the summer of 1944. Chapter three focuses on veiled dissenting voices during the war, but also after when those not supporting the aforementioned myth felt they could only contest it obliquely. Chapter four concentrates on the exceptional but long under-represented role played by women in the Resistance. Chapter five discusses a peculiar aspect of Resistance cinema: comedy -a genre neglected by writers, but hugely popular in the theatre (and later on television). Chapter six examines the renewed and recent interest in the Resistance manifested by French television, which has greatly contributed to the cultural production of the last two decades. Finally, this dissertation includes a comprehensive list of films, novels, poems, and graphic novels on the French Resistance from 1940 to present day.",,,
1295,"The Managed Crisis: Labor Relations and Management in California Agriculture, 1930--1980","From the Great Depression of the 1930s to the Great Recession of the 1970s, American agricultural policy institutionalized the notion of agricultural exceptionalism. First, California growers argued the ""managed crisis"" of the harvest required a flexible and unregulated labor market. Second, California agribusiness represented a middle ground between a yeoman farming tradition and an industrial business model. Many aspects of farming lay completely outside of the control of even the most capable farm operators, regardless of technologically advanced, industrial farming practices. Therefore, growers aggressively pursued business strategies in the hopes of regularizing production and marketing as means of minimizing the gamble of food production. At the same time, they adamantly resisted the decasualization of the farm labor market by either the state or organized farm workers. However, the commercialization of agriculture made growers more vulnerable to boycotts by the United Farm Workers Union, which forced them to deal with unionism during the late 1960s. Growers temporarily embraced collective bargaining legislation as a way of deradicalizing farm unionism and regaining control over their managerial prerogatives. Although it took twelve years for employers under the National Labor Relations Act to curb organized labor significantly, California agribusiness achieved a similar goal in a matter of months. By the 1980s, innovative agribusiness systems of production and human resource management were no longer exceptional. In fact, California agribusiness labor relations became a model for the managers of non-agricultural American industries.",,,
1296,Perspectives on Bulk Locality in Gauge/Gravity Duality,"In this thesis we consider the question of how local bulk physics emerges from the perspective of the boundary field theory in the supergravity limit of gauge/gravity duality. We take three different approaches to this problem, which in retrospect correspond to the different ways of thinking about quantum field theory in the bulk. In the S-matrix approach, we study crossing constraints on two-to-two scattering amplitudes, and provide evidence for the conjecture that a large N expansion and a hierarchy in the spectrum of operator dimension are sufficient conditions for a conformal theory to have a local bulk dual. In the path integral approach we attempt to connect the holographic and Wilsonian renormalization groups. An important role for multi-trace operators is discovered. Although locality remains unexplained, several parallels between holographic and Wilsonian renormalization are made and a physical picture of how the bulk dynamics might emerge from the perspective of the renormalization group is sketched. In the last part we consider the construction of the bulk field operators in terms of smeared boundary operators. Aside from extending the previous work on this construction in several directions, we formulate conditions for obtaining the field operators without already knowing the bulk dynamics and address some paradoxes related to a cat inside a black hole.",,,
1297,Signifying Nothing: How Fiction Represents,"There are many stories about Sherlock Holmes. Or are there? There never was such a person as Sherlock Holmes---that is part of what makes those stories fiction. On the other hand, of course the fictional character Holmes exists, because Arthur Conan Doyle created him. I explore three problems related to this. First, how are fictional objects created? John Searle, Gregory Currie, and a few other theorists sketch accounts in terms of fiction-makers' intentional actions or general propositions that are true in the relevant works. These fail for many kinds of fiction, because fictional objects need not be created intentionally, and need not correspond uniquely to such general propositions. A general account of creation must appeal to the function of fiction, namely to guide our imaginative activity. Kendall Walton uses that to sketch a better answer: works generate fictional objects by guiding us to imaginatively simulate de re mental representation. I develop this in terms of the psychology of mental simulation and de re representation, and argue it is superior to other accounts. Second, do such works that generate fictional objects also represent them? In general, do representations apparently about fictional objects really represent them? Surprisingly, some theorists accept fictional objects but deny they are represented in many cases. I reconstruct and criticize their arguments, concluding that they have not yet found an obstacle to such representation. Third, Peter Geach raises a puzzle: analyze the sentence 'Hob thinks a witch has blighted Bob's mare, and Nob wonders whether she (the same witch) killed Cob's sow' as true even if there are no witches. Dozens of philosophers and linguists see this as a problem in the semantics of anaphora. But based on careful exegesis, I argue that Geach misrepresents the puzzle: the sentence cannot be true if there is no relevant witch, and so the puzzle is to account for its seeming truth without witches. I thus reduce it to the problem of apparent representation of fictional (or mythical) objects. This rules out nearly every published response, but leaves open a few possible paths, which I sketch.",,,
1298,Light Extraction Enhancement of Bulk Nitride Light Emitting Diodes,"Semiconductor light emitting diodes (LEDs) are, as of the writing of this thesis, beginning to replace incandescent and fluorescent forms of space lighting. The technology that is driving this change in lighting has resulted from the development of gallium nitride (GaN) and its various related alloys. Critical to the development of this technology and its proceeding commercialization has been the discovery and improvement of methods for improving light extraction from the semiconductor materials. We demonstrate, characterize, and evaluate the utility of several methods of enhancing photon extraction from LEDs grown homoepitaxially by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on bulk GaN substrates of various crystal orientations. Furthermore, we assess the impact of phosphor deployment methods for achieving optimal light extraction in white lighting applications.",,,
1299,Polyelectrolyte Properties in Mono and Multi-Valent Ionic Media: Brushes and Complex Coacervates,"Materials composed of polyelectrolytes have unique and interesting physical properties resulting primarily from their charged monomer segments. Polyelectrolytes, which exist in many different biological and industrial forms, have also been shown to be highly responsive to external environmental changes. Here, two specific polyelectrolyte systems, brushes and complex coacervates, are discussed in regards to how their properties can be tailored by adjusting the surrounding ionic environment with mono and multi-valent ions. End-tethered polyelectrolyte brushes, which constitute an interesting and substantial portion of polyelectrolyte applications, are well known for their ability to provide excellent lubrication and low friction when coated onto surfaces (e.g. articular cartilage and medical devices), as well as for their ability to stabilize colloidal particles in solution (e.g. paint and cosmetic materials). These properties have been extensively studied with brushes in pure mono-valent ionic media. However, polyelectrolyte brush interactions with multi-valent ions in solution are much less understood, although highly relevant considering mono and multi-valent counterions are present in most applications. Even at very low concentrations of multi-valent ions in solution, dramatic polyelectrolyte brush physical property changes can occur, resulting in collapsed chains which also adhere to one another via multi-valent bridging. Here, the strong polyelectrolyte poly(sodium styrene sulfonate) was studied using the Surface Forces Apparatus (SFA) and electrochemistry in order to investigate brush height and intermolecular interactions between two brushes as a function of multi-valent counterion population inside a brush. Complex coacervates are formed when polyanions and polycations are mixed together in proper conditions of an aqueous solution. This mixing results in a phase separation of a polymer-rich, coacervate phase composed of a chain network held together via electrostatic interactions. Complex coacervates are highly regarded for their extremely low interfacial energy resulting in an ability to spread and adhere to surfaces under water, utilized by marine organisms (e.g. mussels and tubeworms), as well as many encapsulation applications (e.g. pigment encapsulation for carbon-less paper and electronic paper displays). Here, the interfacial energy of coacervates composed of oppositely charged polypeptides, poly(L-lysine) and poly(L-glutamic acid), was investigated using the SFA in regards to changes in bulk mono-valent salt concentrations.",,,
1300,"Rethinking Race, Recognition, and the Politics of Education After Judith Butler's ""Gender Trouble""","While Judith Butler's contributions to feminist thought and queer theory have been widely acknowledged, the significance of her thought for the field of political theory has yet to be fully explored. This dissertation explores how Butler's theories of gender performativity and subjectivation could contribute to current theoretical understandings of three important topics within political theory: race, recognition, and the politics of education. First, this dissertation elaborates a theory of race performativity. It contends that this account of race performativity expands Butler's own framework for analyzing how subjects are produced and differentiated from one another, and that this account also advances current theoretical understandings of race by conceptualizing race as an ongoing, reiterative process and drawing attention to the crucial role that linguistic practices play in the normative production of race. This dissertation then uses these performative understandings of gender and race, as well as the notion of the subject that underlies them, to resolve problems that are commonly associated with normative theories of recognition, particularly those that are grounded in multiculturalist understandings of difference. However, rather than simply revising existing theories of recognition, this dissertation develops a Butlerian approach to recognition and defends it against current theories of recognition such as those put forth by Charles Taylor and Nancy Fraser. Finally, to draw out the normative implications of this Butlerian approach, this dissertation considers how the goals and aims of this approach could be advanced through education. In doing so, it reveals many of the weaknesses that plague liberal multicultural approaches to difference in education and shows how these limitations might be overcome.",,,
1301,The Effects of Prenatal Stress and Adult Neural Stem Cell Ablation on Alcohol Consumption and Seeking-Behaviors,"Alcohol overconsumption is a widespread problem, and understanding both the underlying causes of this maladaptive behavior and the adverse impacts on the brain after alcohol use is therefore important to reducing societal costs. This dissertation reviews the evidence for a link between an early environmental disruption, prenatal stress (PNS), and changes in behavior towards drugs of abuse, including alcohol. Further, it reviews a facet of the PNS phenotype, reductions in the adult neural stem cell (NSC) population, which might contribute to this change, as well as the current evidence for the impact of alcohol on the adult neurogenic system. Given that NSCs are a converging biological target of both PNS and alcohol, it is hypothesized that these cells are a critical mediator of PNS-enhanced alcohol-seeking. Presented here are empirical studies which clarify the functional links between alcohol, prenatal stress, and the adult neurogenic system. The broad aims were to determine whether: 1) Alcohol impacts NSCs in the adult neurogenic system, 2) PNS increases alcohol consumption and seeking, 3) PNS decreases proliferation of NSCs in the adult neurogenic system, and 4) Ablation of the adult neurogenic system mimics the impact of PNS on alcohol seeking and consumption. These studies found that alcohol itself does reduce NSC proliferation and PNS does increase alcohol-seeking behaviors and reduce NSC proliferation, but that ablation of adult NSCs does not reproduce the increased alcohol-seeking component of the PNS phenotype. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for the overarching hypothesis of this dissertation, including a re-evaluation of the linkage between PNS-induced changes in NSCs and alcohol seeking, other mechanisms by which PNS might be changing the alcohol-seeking phenotype, and further implications for the study of alcohol's effects on neural systems.",,,
1302,Spin Engineering in Quantum Wells and Ferromagnetic Semiconductors,"Spin engineering in semiconductors offers the potential of hybrid devices combining the useful properties of semiconductors and magnetic materials. Contemporary electronics do not utilize the spin degree of freedom in electrons, instead operating completely on the accumulation and transport of its charge by taking advantage of the wide conductivity tuning possible in semiconductors. Magnetic memory devices are not tunable, but utilize remanent magnetization to store and read information. The utilization of spins in semiconductors is a proposed route towards low-power computing and quantum computing as well as improved on-chip storage and communications schemes collectively described as ""semiconductor spintronics."" However, semiconductor spintronic materials are presently under development and not commercially applicable at present. Here we describe two routes of spin engineering in GaAs through the growth of heterostructures and alloys by molecular beam epitaxy. An alloy of GaAs with manganese, Ga1-xMnxAs, displays carrier-mediated ferromagnetic behavior. Curie temperature measurements and models suggest the possibility of enhancing the Curie temperature above room temperature, but the material suffers from poor epitaxy and phase segregation at high Mn concentrations. We demonstrate improved epitaxy, almost doubling the magnetic ion incorporation limit, with a combinatorial technique utilizing the geometry of our MBE chamber, but the resulting Curie temperatures do not conform to extrapolated trends. Additionally, scanning tunneling spectroscopy shows critical behavior in our films and provides evidence that a mean-field theoretical treatment may not sufficiently describe GaMnAs. These experiments should lead to a better understanding of ferromagnetism in semiconductors. GaAs heterostructures have intrinsic interactions between spin and orbital angular momentum caused by bulk and structural inversion asymmetry. These interactions enable electrical manipulation of spin, but they also promote decoherence. We systematically engineer balanced bulk and structural asymmetry in GaAs quantum wells to induce a special spin-orbit effective magnetic field. We demonstrate an electron spin lifetime increase of two orders of magnitude for a special pattern of spin polarization. Our results indicate further enhancement is possible and this effect may be strong enough at room temperature for spintronic devices based on electron spin.",,,
1303,Improvements in Social Conversation in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder through Teaching Contingent Queries,"Impairments in social communication are widely recognized as one, if not, the core deficits in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Many of the social communicative behaviors that contribute to sustaining reciprocal conversation are lacking in children with ASD. Specifically, impairments include ignoring or rejecting conversational bids, deficits in sustaining conversation and contingently responding to conversational partners. In addition, researchers have noted children with ASD's impairment in asking appropriate questions during social conversation. Consequently, the development of interventions that target social communication deficits in this population is of marked importance. Naturalistic behavioral interventions have shown promising results in ameliorating the social communicative deficits in children with autism. In addition to demonstrating rapid acquisition and spontaneous use of the target behavior, these types of intervention usually demonstrate generalization effects and meaningful outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine whether intervention strategies incorporating motivational variables can improve the use of contingent queries. Furthermore, the study examined whether the improvements in contingent queries lead to improvements in conversational skills in children with autism. A nonconcurrent multiple baseline design across participants was employed to address the research question. The results indicated that the intervention led to (a) increased use of contingency queries in both environmental conversation and abstract conversation (b) increased synchronous discourse (c) increase in the diversity of responses and (d) increased turn taking during conversation. Furthermore, that data suggest both maintenance and generalization of treatment gains. Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed.",,,
1304,Structure and Reactivity of Grafted Organochromium and Organoborane Complexes on Silica,"Although the Phillips catalyst for ethylene polymerization has been used in industry and intensively studied for more than 50 years, the nature of its active sites remains unconfirmed. Several possibilities have been proposed, including tetravalent, cationic chromium alkyl sites and neutral alkylidenes. In this project, we aim to develop a uniform, silica-supported cationic organochromium(IV) complex using a well-defined borane co-catalyst, to correlate its structure with its polymerization performance, and to investigate the nature of the interaction between silica and supported chromium(IV) complexes, especially those containing an alkylidene ligand. This thesis is divided into three sections. The first focuses on the reaction of B(C6F5)3 with the surface of anhydrous but fully hydroxylated silica (thermally pretreated at 200 C) and a partially dehydroxylated silica (thermally pretreated at 500 C). B(C6F5)3 reacts with silica when a trace of H2O is present. The water can either be added intentionally or formed in situ by borane-induced dehydration of adjacent silanol pairs. The adduct (C6F5)3B*OH2 hydrolyzes to afford C6F5H and (C6F5) 2BOH. The latter reacts with a surface hydroxyl group of silica to yield SiOB(C 6F5)2 and regenerate H2O. When excess B(C6F5)3 is present, the resulting grafted borane appears to be completely dry, due to the eventual formation of [(C 6F5)2B]2O. The grafted borane was characterized by solid-state 11B and 19F MAS NMR, IR, elemental analysis, and C5H5N-TPD. Its ability to activate organometallic complexes for ethylene polymerization was explored. The second section deals with the reaction between B(C6F 5)3 and silica-supported tris(neopentyl)chromium(IV) (SiOCrNp3). In this reaction, a methyl group is transferred to the borane following alpha-methyl elimination from a neopentyl ligand. The resulting silica-supported ion pair, analyzed by IR as well as solid-state 11B, and 19F MAS NMR techniques, is suggested to be [SiOCrNp2]+[MeB(C 6F5)3]-. The borate anion can be extracted from the solid by ion exchange, using either Ph3CCl or MePPh3Br. While the activity of the cationic catalyst is comparable to that of neutral SiOCrNp3, the polydispersity of the resulting polyethylene is much broader. The third section contains a structural analysis of silica-supported bis(neopentyl)chromium (SiO)2CrNp2 and its thermolysis product, (SiO)2Cr=CHC(CH3) 3), using Cr K-edge EXAFS. The majority of sites in the starting material are five-coordinate via interaction with a siloxane ligand derived from the silica surface, while all of the product is four-coordinate with a siloxane ligand.",,,
1305,"Exploring the Relationship between L2 Blogging, Learner Autonomy, and L2 Proficiency Levels: A Case Study of Post-Secondary Japanese L2 Learners","Second language (L2) classrooms commonly consist of diverse learners with different L2 proficiency levels. This heterogeneity of levels has given L2 instructors pedagogical challenges in addressing their students' needs. One of the most promising practical approaches for alleviating this type of teachers' burden is to cultivate learner autonomy---the practice of taking control of one's learning (Benson, 2001)---through computer-assisted language learning materials, such as blogs. This study, conducted in a post-secondary intermediate Japanese L2 course, investigates the relationship(s) between L2 blogging, learner autonomy, and L2 proficiency levels. Drawing on the theoretical perspective that learner autonomy, which signifies self-management, is developed through using metacognitive strategies and metacognitive knowledge (Hauck, 2005), I explore how two more and two less proficient learners self-managed their L2 learning and use in the blogging process by employing metacognitive strategies and metacognitive knowledge. The qualitative analyses of data collected through think-aloud protocols, portfolios, post-interviews, and blog discourse observations demonstrate that L2 blogging supports the development of learner autonomy in a way that allows learners to individualize L2 learning. All of the learners set their personal learning goals to study specific types of content through blogging, focused their attention on the practice during the processes, and characterized their blog entries/comments as learning products. Simultaneously, however, L2 proficiency levels determined the subjects' individualized learning methods and the degree of their self-management of L2 use. The more proficient learners benefited more from interdependence for promoting learner autonomy (Little, 1994) in the blogosphere: they developed learner autonomy while experiencing authentic online social interaction with and relying on feedback from more capable language users. In contrast, the less proficient learners took less advantage of blog communication in individualizing their learning and had challenges in self-managing L2 use. These findings provide a broader theoretical basis for learner autonomy developed in learning processes with blogs in terms of individualized learning and teacher expectations. They also enhance teachers' understanding of how to incorporate blogs in L2 classrooms. It is critical that instructors consider the promotion of metacognitive knowledge and pedagogical interventions, especially for less proficient learners.",,,
1307,The Media Is The Medicine: A Model For Diagnostic Interpretation,"Symptomatic interpretation is a widely-used critical strategy in film and media studies that may be improved upon by further dialogue with medicine. This dissertation attempts just such a dialogue---via an interdisciplinary examination of medical diagnosis, narrative medicine, entertainment-education, and past and present modes of film and media symptomatic interpretation. Based upon this analysis, a model of ""diagnostic interpretation"" is proposed. In keeping with the medical distinction between symptoms (the aches and pains that the patient subjectively reports to the doctor) and signs (what the doctor observes directly on or in the patient's body), a similar distinction is carved out with a model for diagnostic interpretation: Symptoms are articulated as residing within the ""minds"" of the spectators, whereas signs (which are often the cause of symptoms) are understood as residing in the ""bodies"" of the films. Similar to medical practice, a diagnosis is constructed by (1) asking spectators to recount their symptoms, and (2) then (and only then) examining the body of the film for its signs as thrown into relief by the reported symptoms. This experience is then written as a narrative of its own discovery, and crucially includes the subjectivity of the diagnostician. As with a medical diagnosis---in which objective validity is arguably less important than how helpful said diagnosis is to the patient---this critical mode tables the question of validity-in-interpretation and focuses instead on constructing actionable and compelling narratives that fit a specific context and given situational need.",,,
1308,Optimal Observer Model of Single Fixation Oddity Search Predicts a Shallow Set Size Function,"A common finding in oddity search, a search in which the target is unknown but defined to be different from the distractors, is that human performance remains insensitive or even improves with number of distractors (set-size). A number of explanations based on perceptual and attentional mechanisms have been proposed to explain the anomalous set-size effect. Here, we consider whether the shallower set-size function for oddity search could be explained by stimulus information and task demands. We developed an ideal observer and a difference coding (standard deviation) model for single fixation oddity search and compared it to the ideal observer in the standard target known search as well as to human performance in both search tasks. Performance for the ideal and difference coding model in the oddity search resulted in a shallower set-size function than the target known ideal observer and were good predictors of human search accuracy. However, the ideal observer model was a better predictor than the standard deviation model for ten of the twelve data sets. The results highlight the importance of using ideal observer analysis to separate contributions to human performance arising from perceptual/attentional mechanisms inherent to the human brain from those contributions arising from differences in task demands.",,,
1309,Signifying Nothing: The Problem of Language in Gorgias,"Gorgias' epideictic speech, the Encomium of Helen, extols language's power as a mighty ruler able to sway our emotions, thoughts, and beliefs and to cast over us a durglike spell of distortion; meanwhile this fifth-century Greek sophist's earlier work of a more metaphysical nature, thought to parody the treatises of the Eleatic thinkers and entitled On Non Being, points out language's emptiness and inability to communicate reality. Although these two Gorgianic characterizations of language at first seem to contradict each other, both could be interpreted as indicative of a radical nominalism more commonly associated with modernist linguistic and literary theory that grants to language autonomy from and primacy over reality. Words in such a view are not representational but approach signifying nothing. More importantly perhaps, with this perspective Gorgias raises issues about language not satisfactorily dealt with until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. For example, as constitutive of reality, and so distorting, language, which Gorgias dubs a mighty ruler, would seem to be able to determine both what we perceive and can conceive while its metaphoric nature and opacity limit our access to truth which now becomes internal to language. Moreover, as autonomous from both reality and logic, language often seems like a bewitchment of our intelligence. Furthermore, the performative dimension attributed to radically nominalist language evokes the question of agency and intentionality, leaving us condemned to use a language that is ultimately using us. Lastly, the self-referential or tautological and empty nature of language, its distinct ontology, as described by Gorgias in On Non Being leads to the impossibility of saying anything as well as to the impossibility of knowing reality, and finally, to nihilism. While in the context of fifth-century Greece, the revolutionary statements Gorgias makes in these two works concerning language's autonomy from reality represented a linguistic turning point, his self-conscious and self-referential approach to language and awareness of his own rhetoricity as well as his departure from traditional modes of language usage and genre speak to the appropriateness of scrutinizing this sophist's work through a modernist lens.",,,

1313,Nonpolar m-plane gallium Nitride-based Laser Diodes in the Blue Spectrum,"Gallium nitride (GaN), together with its alloys with aluminum and indium, have revolutionized the solid-state optoelectronics market for their ability to emit a large portion of the visible electromagnetic spectrum from deep ultraviolet and into the infrared. GaN-based semiconductor laser diodes (LDs) with emission wavelengths in the violet, blue and green are already seeing widespread implementation in applications ranging from energy storage, lighting and displays. However, commercial GaN-based LDs use the basal c-plane orientation of the wurtzite crystal, which can suffer from large internal electric fields due to discontinuities in spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations, limiting device performance. The nonpolar orientation of GaN benefits from the lack of polarization-induced electric field as well as enhanced gain. This dissertation discusses some of the benefits and limitations of m-plane oriented nonpolar GaN for LD applications in the true blue spectrum (450 nm). Topics include an overview of material growth by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), waveguide design and processing techniques for improving device performance for multiple lateral mode and single lateral mode ridge waveguides.",,,
1314,Three-dimensional Navier-Stokes simulations of miscible displacements in Hele-Shaw cells,"Three-dimensional Navier-Stokes simulations of gravitationally and viscously unstable, miscible displacements in Hele-Shaw cells are discussed. In neutrally bouyant displacements, quasisteady fingers are observed whose tip velocity increases with the Peclet number and the unfavourable viscosity ratio. Cross-sections at constant streamwise locations reveal the existence of a streamwise vorticity quadrupole along the length of the finger. This quadrupole leads to the emergence of a longitudinal, inner splitting phenomenon behind the tip. The generation of those vorticity quadrupoles is related to the viscous fingering instability acting along the streamwise direction. By looking at different aspect ratios we assess the competition between multiple fingers, and the interaction between inner splitting and tip-splitting; and by analysing displacements with nonmonotonic viscosity profiles, we present a natural way to control finger growth. In vertical Hele-Shaw cells, a destabilizing density difference generally increases the velocity of the two-dimensional base flow displacement front. These two-dimensional simulations reveal several possible configurations for the streamline patterns, from single stagnation points in gravitationally unstable displacements to multiple stagnation points and recirculation zones, and spike formation in stable configurations. A two-dimensional pinch-off governed by dispersion is observed some distance behind the displacement front. Three-dimensional simulations show that the inner splitting instability in vertical displacements is delayed for increasing unfavorable density differences, even though the streamwise vorticity quadrupole's strength increases for larger gravity numbers. For large unstable density differences the formation of a secondary, downward propagating front develops an anchor-like shape as a result of the flow induced by quadrupoles. In horizontal displacements, we identify a number of mechanisms concerning the interaction of viscous fingering with a spanwise Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The dominant wavelength of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability generally is shorter than that of the fingering instability, which results in the formation of plumes of the more viscous fluid not only in between neighboring viscous fingers, but also along the center of fingers, thereby destroying their shoulders and splitting them longitudinally. We identify a transition from viscously dominated to gravitationally dominated displacements, and correlate this behavior to the magnitudes of the streamwise and gapwise vorticity components. Gap-averaged, time-dependent concentration profiles show that variable density displacement fronts propagate more slowly than their constant density counterparts. This indicates that the gravitational mixing results in a more complete expulsion of the resident fluid from the Hele-Shaw cell. This observation may be of interest in the context of enhanced oil recovery or carbon sequestration applications.",,,
1315,Sub-wavelength Metal Gratings for In-plane Lasers and Integrated Optical Elements,"Sub-wavelength periodic metal structures are currently being explored by many branches of photonics for enhanced light control on the nano-scale. Metal holes or slits have shown promise in plasmonic application areas like mirrors, couplers, waveguides, and lenses. These structures are also beginning to making a large impact on many emerging areas in photonics such as slow light, left-handed materials, and sensing. While metal and semiconductor integrated devices have rapidly advanced in sophistication over the last decade, few have yet to address the major challenges associated with transitioning from individual devices that demonstrate basic, physical operation to devices with potential for current and near-future telecommunications applications. Outstanding novel devices using metals have been presented, but they are missing key features that allow them to be integrated into photonic circuits. As we begin bridging the gap between simple, passive devices fabricated with traditional optical lithography and basic liftoff techniques to more sophisticated, sub-wavelength scale active devices, we focus on sub-wavelength metal gratings with design choices made to favor integration, both with respect to current state of the art optical components and fabrication on the nano- and micro-scale. In this dissertation, we present a theoretical and experimental study of potential applications of sub-wavelength metal gratings in photonic integrated circuits. We consider on-chip slow light functionality and determine that the most achievable near-term impact of sub-wavelength metal gratings can be made in the area of on-chip, in-plane metal mirrors. We demonstrate the operation of a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser with two metal grating mirrors operating on an InP-based materials platform. We account for future design considerations of scale and polarization to show that there is strong potential for integrating sub-wavelength metal gratings into current photonic integrated circuits.",,,
1316,"German Blood -- Polish Mind? Exploring the Immigration Histories of Resettlers from Poland to West Germany, 1970s--1990","This study examines the immigration of Polish resettlers to West Germany during the 1970s and 1980s. During this time nearly one million Poles immigrated to West Germany. The majority of them were able to claim German citizenship by documenting their German ethnic origins. They became known as Aussiedler, resettlers. Enjoying the legal privileges of immediate citizenship, they attracted only minor public attention as immigrants. Perhaps it was the cultural and political invisibility that eclipsed their experience as immigrants and earned the Poles the reputation of successful and exemplary integrators. Yet, if publicly the resettlers remained unnoticed as migrants, how did they experience the processes of immigration and integration on an individual level? Using oral histories, this research documents how the Polish resettlers remembered their past. Through the analysis of the personal stories, the study reveals the ways in which they contextualized their resettler history and made sense of who they are as German citizens with Polish biographies.",,,
1317,The Development of a Tool to Assess Cultural Frame of Reference Among Recent Immigrant Latino Parents of Children With Disabilities,"Little is known about societal variables impacting service access and utilization patterns of recent immigrant Latino families of children with developmental disabilities and there is no paradigm to explain their past and present cognitions regarding their perceptions of disability rights. I hypothesized that many have historical, social, cultural and educational contexts that influence the extent to which they are empowered to seek meaningful outcomes from educational and social service systems they encounter in the U.S. I addressed one of the underlying ideologies I believed was related to the patterns of service access and utilization seen among monolingual, Spanish Speaking, immigrant Latino parents of children with disabilities. I believed this construct contributed uniquely to patterns in parental access and utilization of educational and social services for Latino parents of children with disabilities. I was particularly interested in, for which there are currently no quantitative measures to address, is termed Cultural Frame of Reference. I intended to see if John Ogbu's theory regarding Cultural Frame of Reference applied to monolingual Spanish speaking Latino immigrant parents of children with disabilities. I created a new tool for measuring a theoretically derived construct that explains the variability in the extent to which Latino immigrant parents seek and advocate for services received by their children with developmental disabilities. To do so, I developed items based on indicators found in the literature and piloted the items with parents totaling a sample of 101 in order to collect sufficient data to conduct psychometric analyses. I then examined the items using inter-item correlation and exploratory factor analysis. These data were used to conduct an initial test of construct validity. The new measurement scale identified underlying sociocultural experiences in the everyday encounters of participants. The scale substantiated context, present, and past perceptions of social services and rights' based service system. It also preliminarily suggests Cultural Frame of Reference needs to explore further as a variable involved in the access and utilization patterns among immigrant parents of Latino children with disabilities.",,,
1318,A Multilevel Examination of Students' Problem Behavior: The Importance of School Climate and Classroom Contextual Factors,"Reducing student problem behavior remains a leading concern for school officials, as disruptive and aggressive behavior interferes with student achievement, as well as the overall climate of the school. However, the systemic and often complicated nature of schools makes it difficult for researchers and practitioners to identify contributing factors to students' behavior. The current study builds upon school effectiveness literature and examines student problem behavior through a transactional-ecological lens by taking into account individual (e.g., gender, ethnicity, prosocial behavior), classroom (e.g., teacher characteristics, class size, behavioral norms), and school-level factors (e.g., location, SES, school climate). Using data from 37 Maryland schools, 467 classrooms, and 8,750 elementary school-aged students, a series of seven hierarchical linear models (HLM) were tested. HLM analyses revealed that while individual student characteristics had the largest influence on problem behavior, teacher perceptions of the school climate and the behavioral norms of the classroom significantly related to how students behaved. These findings support the use of climate-enhancing intervention programs implemented both school-wide and in the classroom as a means of reducing student problem behavior.",,,
1319,"The Chemistry of Uranyl(VI) and Uranyl(V) with Soft Nitrogen, Carbon, and Sulfur Donors","This work focuses on the interaction between the uranyl(VI) ([UO 2]2+) and uranyl(V) ([UO2]+) ions with soft (nitrogen, carbon, sulfur) donor ligands. We attempted to ligate various neutral nitrogen donor ligands to the [UO2(Ar 2nacnac)]+/0 fragments. Ar2nacnac (Ar 2nacnac = {(2,6-iPr2C 6H3)2NC(Me)}2CH--) is a very sterrically demanding ligand, and stabilizes uranyl(V). Using this framework we were able to ligate two nitrogen ligands (py and 1-methylimidazole (MeIm)) to the [UO2(Ar2nacnac)]+ fragment to produce UO2(Ar2nacnac)(OTf)py (2.1) and [UO2(Ar2nacnac)(MeIm)2][OTf] (2.2). We then compared the binding affinity of these ligands to that of the Ph2MePO ligand and found the Ph2MePO ligand to have a higher affinity for the uranyl(VI) fragment than either py or MeIm. Using 2.1 as a starting material, we were able to produce the uranyl(V) complex UO2(Ar2nacnac)(py)2 (3.1). 3.1 has proven to be an excellent starting material for the formation of other UO2(Ar2nacnac) complexes containing the other N-donor ligands: 2,2'-bipyridine (bipy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), N,N-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), and MeIm to make the corresponding UO2(Ar2nacnac)( N-donor)x (x=1,2) complexes. We then determined the binding affinity series for the UO2(Ar2nacnac) fragment as phen > MeIm > TMEDA > bipy > py. Using the [UO2(Ar2nacnac)]+ scaffold, we have produced several uranyl organometallic complexes using MeIm based aryl ligands. The most stable of these complexes is [Li(MeIm)][UO(mu-O)(Ar 2nacnac)(mu:&eegr;-MeIm)2] (4.5). We have probed the reactivity of 4.5 and have performed the metathesis reaction between 4.5 and MCl2 (M = Fe, Co) to produce the bimetallic complexes [MCl(MeIm)][UO2(Ar2nacnac)(mu- N-MeIm)2] (M = Fe, 4.7; M = Co, 4.8 ). The binding affinity between three thione ligands (2-mercaptomethylimidazolyl-pyridine (mpyMe), bis(mercaptomethylimidazolyl)methane (BmmMe ), and ortho-bis(mercaptomethylimidazolyl) xylene (O-BmxMe)) and the uranyl(VI) ion was explored. Using UO 2{N(TMS)2}2(THF)2 as a starting material we have been able to produce three UO2{N(TMS)2} 2(thione) complexes (5.1 -- 5.3), and have determined the binding affinity of these ligands against each other, as well as THF and DME. Lastly, we probed the reactivity between (py-2-CH2)NHC(Me)CHC(Me) O (Mepyacnac) and the uranyl(VI) and U(IV) ions. We have been able to produce two uranyl(VI)mono(Mepyacnac) complexes (UO2(Mepyacnac)Cl(THF) (6.1) and UO2(Mepyacnac)(OTf)(THF) (6.2)), one uranyl(VI)bis(Mepyacnac) complex (UO2( Mepyacnac)2, 6.3), and two U(IV)bis(Mepyacnac) complexes (UCl2(Mepyacnac)2 (6.4 ) and U(N3)2(Mepyacnac)2 ( 6.5)). The initial studies on the reactivity these complexes were explored.",,,
1320,Discrepancies between implicit and explicit collective self-esteem: Implications for intergroup behavior,"What motivates people to discriminate against outgroups? Why are some people more likely to discriminate than others? Several theories propose that low self-esteem predicts discrimination. However, empirical research in support of these theories has been decidedly mixed. The current research examines whether the association between self-esteem and discrimination can be clarified by examining implicit, in addition to explicit, measures of collective self-esteem (CSE). I hypothesized that the interaction between implicit and explicit CSE would predict intergroup bias such that people with inconsistent implicit and explicit CSE would exhibit more intergroup bias than people with consistent implicit and explicit CSE. I reasoned that people with inconsistent CSE would be especially motivated to discriminate as a way to reduce the discrepancy between their implicit and explicit attitudes. Across two studies I examined whether implicit and explicit CSE interact to predict intergroup bias, as indexed by: attributions about, evaluations of, and resource allocation to the ingroup versus outgroup. Study 1 examined White and Latino participants' CSE regarding their university and ethnicity. Study 2 examined only White participants' CSE regarding their university, but introduced a manipulation of ingroup threat (article about university's poor reputation) and controlled for related variables (implicit and explicit personal self-esteem and explicit group identification). The results of the current research did not support predictions. Overall, the findings were mixed; some of the results suggested that participants with consistent CSE exhibited more intergroup bias, whereas other results suggested that participants with inconsistent CSE exhibited more intergroup bias. In study 1, Latino and White participants with consistent CSE evaluated the ingroup, relative to the outgroup, more positively compared to participants with inconsistent CSE. In contrast, Latino and White participants with inconsistent CSE allocated more resources to the ingroup versus the outgroup. In study 2, in contrast to study 1, implicit and explicit CSE interacted to predict intergroup bias among White participants, but only when they experienced a threat to their university ingroup. The pattern of the interaction in the threat condition, however, paralleled some of the results of study 1. White participants with consistent CSE evaluated the ingroup, relative to the outgroup, most positively. Overall, the current research suggests that the relationship between implicit CSE, explicit CSE, and intergroup bias is complex and may vary depending on a multitude of factors. Nonetheless, despite inconclusive findings, the current research demonstrates the importance of examining both implicit and explicit attitudes when exploring the processes underlying discrimination.",,,
1321,"A ""Spiritual Solution"": The Influence of Emmet Fox and New Thought on Alcoholics Anonymous","Scholars have long wondered how the small religious movement of New Thought has come to have such a profound and diffuse impact on American culture. This paper argues that Alcoholics Anonymous may have served as one mass dispersal mechanism for New Thought ideas. My work demonstrates that the founding members of AA were influenced by the popular Depression-era New Thought teacher Emmet Fox, in particular his book The Sermon on the Mount: The Key to Success in Life. A comparison of Fox's Sermon and AA's foundational text, Alcoholics Anonymous (or the Big Book, as it is known to members), provides evidence of this influence and suggests one means by which many Americans have been introduced to New Thought ideas.",,,
1322,Acid Functionalized Mesoporous Ordered Materials for the Production of 5-Hydroxymethyfurfural from Carbohydrates,"Solid acid catalysts were designed for the conversion of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Some of the catalysts incorporate thioether groups to promote the tautomerization of fructose to its furanose form, as well as sulfonic acid groups to catalyze its dehydration. A bifunctional silane, 3-((3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl)thio)propane-1-sulfonic acid (TESAS), was designed for incorporation into SBA-15-type silica by co-condensation. To achieve mesopore ordering in the functionalized silica, the standard SBA-15 synthetic protocol was modified, resulting in well-formed hexagonal particles. Functional groups incorporated into mesoporous silica by co-condensation are more robust under the reaction conditions than those grafted onto a non-porous silica. In a variation, the thioether group of TESAS was oxidized by H2O 2 to the sulfone during the synthesis of the modified SBA-15. The materials were tested in batch reactors and compared in the selective dehydration of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Compared to benchmark catalysts, the thioether-containing TESAS-SBA-15 showed the highest activity in the dehydration of aqueous fructose, as well as the highest selectivity towards HMF (71 % at 84 % conversion). In addition, the stability of several supported acid catalysts was evaluated in tubular reactors designed to produce 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) continuously. The reactors, packed with the solid catalysts, were operated at 403 K for extended periods, up to 180 h. The behaviors of three propylsulfonic acid-functionalized, ordered porous silicas (one inorganic SBA-15-type silica, and two ethane-bridged SBA-15-type organosilicas) were compared with that of a propylsulfonic acid-modified, non-ordered porous silica. The HMF selectivity of the catalysts with ordered pore structures ranged from 60 to 75 %, while the selectivity of the non-ordered catalyst peaked at 20 %. The latter was also the least stable, deactivating with a first-order rate constant of 0.152 h-1. The organosilicas are more hydrothermally stable and maintained a steady catalytic activity longer than inorganic SBA-15-type silica. The organosilica with an intermediate framework ethane content of 45 mol % was the most stable, with a first-order deactivation rate constant of only 0.012 h-1. Deactivation under flow conditions is caused primarily by hydrolytic cleavage of acid sites, which can be (to some extent) recaptured by the free surface hydroxyl groups of the silica surface.",,,
1324,Design of Integrated III-Nitride/Non-III-Nitride Multijunction Photovoltaic Devices,"The integration of III-nitride and non-III-nitride materials for tandem solar cell applications can improve the efficiency of the photovoltaic device due to the added power contributed by the III-nitride (III-N) top cell to that of high-efficiency multijunction non-III-nitride (non-III-N) solar cells if the device components are properly designed and optimized. The tandem solar cell is comprised of a III-N top cell wafer bonded to a non-III-N subcell. The top cell is electrically isolated but optically coupled to the underlying subcell resulting in an unconstrained tandem cell design between the III-N top cell and the non-III-N subcell. The underlying subcell is a series-connected multijunction cell. The use of a III-N top cell is potentially beneficial when the top junction of a stand-alone non-III-N cell generates more photocurrent than the limiting current of the non-III-N subcell. The high energy photon absorption by the III-N top cell and the use of layer thickness optimization to adjust the amount of light absorbed by the junctions in the subcell result in less thermalization loss and a higher limiting current for the non-III-N subcell. This consequently results in improved total efficiency. When the non-III-N cell's top junction is the limiting junction, the minimum power conversion efficiency that the III-N top cell must contribute should compensate for the spectrum filtered from the multijunction subcell for this design to be useful. As the absorption edge wavelength, lambdaN, of the III-N top cell increases, the performance of the multijunction subcell decreases due to spectral filtering. In the most common spectra of interest (AM1.5G, AM1.5D and AM0), the technology to grow InGaN cells with lambdaN < 520 nm is found to be sufficient for III-N top cell applications. The device requirements for the InGaN top cell applications in terms of minimum required external quantum efficiency, maximum tolerable voltage offset and maximum tolerable degradation in fill factor and power conversion efficiency are presented. The minimum tolerable area ratio between the III-N and non-III-N subcells in a 3- or 4- terminal device is also determined. Furthermore, the effects of surface/interface reflections are also presented. The management of these reflection issues determines the feasibility of the integrated III-nitride/non-III-nitride design to improve overall cell efficiency. Finally, the process for integrating a III-N and a non-III-N cell as well as preliminary results of a wafer-bonded InGaN/GaAs tandem solar cell are presented.",,,
1325,1.55 microm Indium Gallium Arsenide THz Synchronized Photoconductive Switch Array,"Metal-particle-in-semiconductor nanocomposites are of continuing interest in materials science to produce electronic, photonic, and thermoelectric devices, as well as chemical and biological nanosensors. These materials have successfully been employed for THz photoconductive devices operating at 800 nm. To date, producing devices operating at the desirable pump wavelength of 1.55 microm at which both mode-locked and single-frequency lasers needed for THz generation are readily available, remains challenging. Excessive dark current and prohibitively low breakdown voltage have been the primary impediments. Recent research has shown that ErAs:In0.53Ga0.47As designed for subpicosecond photoconductivity exhibits an exponential increase in resistivity when cooled to temperatures below 250 K. This increased resistivity gives promise to producing THz sources since higher bias voltages can be used, thus increasing the optical to THz conversion efficiency. One of the major limitations of THz photoconductive sources is that it is challenging to harness sizeable power. Typical power levels generated by THz sources at 1.55 microm are generally in the low microwatts region. This dissertation demonstrates a 1.55 microm THz synchronized linear array that maximizes power and has attained an impressive maximum peak power of 123 microW. In addition, THz beam steering at 1.55 microm by phase control in the time domain is a young field. Beam steering is demonstrated with this phased array up to 14.6 using optical delay line units. The possibility of beam steering will prove beneficial in various applications, particularly in standoff imaging.",,,
1326,Recent Advances in Palladium-Catalyzed Kumada-Corriu Couplings,Since the early 1970's transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have been a major part of the landscape of synthetic chemistry. Among these reactions palladium-catalyzed reactions have attracted special attention due to their mild conditions and the high degree of functional group tolerance displayed by palladium salts. Despite the remarkable progress made in advancing the field of palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions in the last forty years there exist substantial limitation to the use of palladium catalysts in the presence of substrates bearing beta-hydrogen atoms due to the facile beta-hydride elimination reaction associated with palladium salts. In the interest of expanding the utility of these palladium salt catalysts we investigated the possibility of utilizing a sterically hindered palladium-phosphine complex to facilitate rapid cross-coupling reactions of beta-hydride bearing Grignard reagents in the Kumada-Corriu reaction. We discovered that when a catalytic system composed of catalytic (dtbpf)PdCl2 and stoichiometric amounts of the diamine ligand TMEDA was employed we were able to selectively cross-couple alkenyl halides with beta-hydride bearing Grignard reagents in excellent yields with minimal side-product formation.,,,
1327,"Time-scales of crustal anatexis in the Ama Drime Massif, southern Tibet","As an active continent-continent collision zone, the Himalayan orogen provides a superb natural laboratory to study a wide range of tectonic processes. One process inexorably linked to tectonism is melt generation, which can occur in a multitude of ways. Partial melting of continental crust, anatexis, typically produces migmatites and melts of granitic composition. Studying these granites in their geologic context allows placement of age maxima and minima for tectonic events, thus allowing evaluation of tectonic hypotheses. This study examines the timescales of anatexis and melt mobilization in the Ama Drime Massif (ADM), an exposure of mid-to-lower-crustal material in the Everest region. The ADM crosscuts a major Miocene fault system, the South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS), and is structurally lower than the GHS. Thus, it provides valuable information about post-STDS Himalayan tectonics. Using laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), U(-Th)-Pb geochronology of accessory minerals in leucogranite intrusions in the ADM demonstrates that, compared with the overlying GHS, melting in the ADM was short-lived---the entire range of granite crystallization occurred over _6 m.y. (8.5 +/- 0.1 Ma to 14.6 +/- 0.1 Ma)---after ductile deformation ceased in both the Everest region Greater Himalayan Series (GHS) and Northern Himalayan gneiss domes (NHGD). This study indicates that the ADM was largely unparticipatory in melting events that pervasively affect the GHS and NHGD, and records mid-crustal processes within the orogen after movement stopped on the STDS.",,,
1328,A biochemical linkage between methanogenesis and protein synthesis in hydrogenotrophic archaea,"Hydrogenotrophic methanogens possessing the hydrogen-dependent dehydrogenase Hmd also encode paralogs of this protein whose function is poorly understood. Here we present biochemical evidence that the two inactive Hmd paralogs of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, HmdII and HmdIII, form binary and ternary complexes with several components of the protein translation apparatus. HmdII and HmdIII, but not the active dehydrogenase Hmd, bind with micromolar binding affinities to a number of tRNAs and form ternary complexes with tRNA(Pro) and prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS). Fluorescence spectroscopy experiments also suggest that binding of HmdII and ProRS involves distinct binding determinants on the tRNA. These biochemical data suggest the possibility of a regulatory link between energy production and protein translation pathways that may allow a rapid cellular response to altered environmental conditions.",,,
1329,An Analysis of Students' Korean Language Use in a Korean-English Two-Way Immersion Classroom,"The potential for successful language development outcomes in Two-Way Immersion (TWI) programs has sparked great interest among educators, researchers, and policy makers. However, to date most empirical research in TWI settings has focused on Spanish-English programs; research on the development and use of partner languages other than Spanish is scarce. This study examines how students use Korean in a 50/50 Korean-English TWI classroom. First, it investigates whether a difference in the quantity of the students' language use between Korean and English exists. Second, if there is a difference, it further investigates the conditions under which the students use the Korean language in the classroom. The study conceptually draws from the input-interaction-output model in second language acquisition research and the notions of space and scale to better understand how language use opportunities are shaped by the conditions of the classroom-level spaces in which interactions take place. The data of this study were collected through video and audio recording of classroom interactions (approximately 20 hours); interviews with teachers, parents, and students (39 interviews); and field notes during observations (12 field notes). The amounts of students' Korean and English language use were analyzed quantitatively focusing on the analytic unit of ""content words,"" and the classroom spaces in which the students used Korean were examined quantitatively and qualitatively using the analytic unit of ""language use episodes."". The findings revealed an imbalance in the students' language use between the two languages. The students preferred to use English even during Korean instructional time. Also, the use of Korean depended on a variety of different conditions in classroom spaces. First, the gap between the teachers' and the students' understanding of the classroom language policy created different expectations of what is acceptable language use in the classroom. Second, the students were sensitive to their perceptions of their interlocutors' language proficiency level, which determined their language choice. Third, language proficiency-based grouping strategies were found to provide Korean-dominant students with opportunities to use and practice Korean, but to deprive English-dominant students of opportunities to use Korean. Fourth, repetitive teaching and learning practices---literacy activities involving peer interactions in centers and oral practices involving interactions with teachers in whole-class lessons---influenced the students' language use by forming a habit of using the Korean language with particular interlocutors, activities, and group organizations. Fifth, language functions seemed to influence English-dominant students' language use in that Korean use was restricted to academic and quasi-academic functions and English was used for all purposes, including non-academic functions. Based on the findings, it is hoped that this study will contribute to identifying ways of promoting TWI students' use of non-English partner languages and to the prosperity of TWI programs and bilingual education in our global world.",,,
1330,Parent-Implemented Video Self-Management Targeting Nonverbal Pragmatics in Children with Autism,"Parent-Implemented Video Self --Management Targeting Nonverbal Pragmatics in Children with Autism by Katherine JoAnne Levinger Social deficits are considered a primary symptom of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This includes difficulties with pragmatics and social conversation. Many individuals with ASD display inappropriate nonverbal pragmatic behavior when engaging in social conversation about typical, age --appropriate topics. The current study employed a multiple baseline design across participants to assess the effects of a parent --implemented video self --management intervention to improve a child's nonverbal pragmatic behavior and reciprocal responding during social conversation. The study also assessed whether the intervention would result in collateral gains in parent affect and confidence, child affect, and parent --child synchronous engagement. Results indicated that the intervention was associated with increased percentages of appropriate nonverbal pragmatic behavior, as well as increased percentages of reciprocal responding, during social conversation. Collateral gains also occurred in child affect, parent affect and confidence, and parent --child synchronous engagement. Additionally, gains associated with the intervention generalized to new conversational partners and maintained over time.",,,
1331,Studies on Einstein manifolds and Ricci solitons,"This thesis studies canonical metrics on Riemannian manifolds. It consists of two parts. In the first part, we study Einstein four-manifolds with 3-positive curvature operator. We prove that if the curvature operator is 3-positive, then the sectional curvature has a positive lower bound which depends only on the Einstein constant; we also partially improve results of Brendle [Bre10], and Bohm-Wilking [BW08]. In the second part, we study gradient steady Ricci solitons. We first prove that the infimum of the potential function decays linearly, which implies that any gradient steady Ricci soliton with bounded potential function must be Ricci flat, and that no gradient steady Ricci soliton has uniformly positive scalar curvature. Further we show that if the potential function satisfies a uniform condition, then the gradient steady Ricci soliton has at most Euclidean volume growth.",,,
1332,Three-Dimensional Visualization of Interfacial Phenomena Using Confocal Microscopy,"Surfactants play an integral role in numerous functions ranging from stabilizing the emulsion in a favorite salad dressing to organizing the cellular components that make life possible. We are interested in lung surfactant, which is a mixture of lipids and proteins essential for normal respiration because it modulates the surface tension of the air-liquid interface of the thin fluid lining in the lungs. Through this surface tension modulation, lung surfactant ensures effortless lung expansion and prevents lung collapse during exhalation, thereby effecting proper oxygenation of the bloodstream. The function of lung surfactant, as well as numerous interfacial lipid systems, is not solely dictated by the behavior of materials confined to the two-dimensional interface. Rather, the distributions of materials in the liquid subphase also greatly influence the performance of interfacial films of lung surfactant. Therefore, to better understand the behavior of lung surfactant and other interfacial lipid systems, we require a three-dimensional characterization technique. In this dissertation, we have developed a novel confocal microscopy methodology for investigating the interfacial phenomena of surfactants at the air-liquid interface of a Langmuir trough. Confocal microscopy provides the excellent combination of in situ, fast, three-dimensional visualization of multiple components of the lung surfactant system that other characterization techniques lack. We detail the solutions to the numerous challenges encountered when imaging a dynamic air-liquid interface with a high-resolution technique like confocal microscopy. We then use confocal microscopy to elucidate the distinct mechanisms by which a polyelectrolyte (chitosan) and nonadsorbing polymer (polyethylene glycol) restore the function of lung surfactant under inhibitory conditions mimicking the effects of lung trauma. Beyond this physiological model, we also investigate several one- and two-component interfacial films of the various lipid constituents of lung surfactant. Confocal microscopy allows us to use a water-soluble, cationic fluorophore that partitions into the disordered phases of lipid monolayers. By exploiting the properties of this water-soluble fluorophore, we investigate both the phase behavior and electrostatics of the interfacial lipid systems. Overall, we believe the work presented in this dissertation provides the building blocks for establishing confocal microscopy as a ubiquitous characterization technique in the interfacial and surface sciences.",,,
1333,Through the Crystal Veil: Devotional Discipline and the Ambivalence of the Material Image on the Sacro Monte di Varallo,"This thesis addresses issues of vision and the role of the material image in devotional practice at the Sacro Monte di Varallo, a fifteenth-century Italian pilgrimage site built by Franciscans to simulate the experience of visiting the Holy Land through mimetically recreated sacred places. Beginning in the early sixteenth century, the small chapels that marked the Sacro Monte's recreated the sacred sites were filled with life-size tableaux representing episodes from the life of Christ. Visitors could interact physically with the tableaux until the mid-sixteenth century when architect Galeazzo Alessi designed glass partitions, or vetriate, to separate the viewers from the figures. The following paper discusses the impact of the vetriate on the nature of viewer/image relationships at the Sacro Monte. Previously, scholars have viewed the vetriate only as disciplining instruments of the Counter-Reformation, designed to prevent viewers from wrongly venerating the material image by restricting physical access to the tableaux. By looking primarily at the Libro dei Misteri (1565--1569), the book in which Alessi recorded his plans for the Sacro Monte, I argue that in fact thevetriate created an ambivalent relationship between the viewer and the material image by disciplining the viewer's physical relationship with the tableaux while simultaneously enshrining the images in a manner similar to a reliquary. I approach the vetriate as frames that not only influence the viewer's bodily relationship to the tableaux but also his or her mode of engaging with the image. I argue that the vetriate, by virtue of their construction and decoration, would have signaled to the viewer the importance, even preciousness, of the tableaux. The mimetic qualities of the Sacro Monte (which in many ways functions as a relic itself) as well as contemporaneous literature that addresses reliquaries and the partitioning of ecclesiastical space, support the argument that the vetriate enhanced rather than diminished the material importance of the tableaux and their role as relic-like links between the viewer and the life of Christ.",,,
1334,Structural switching and biological applications of nucleic acid-lipid films,"While most nucleic acid (NA)-lipid complexes (lipoplexes) are studied in solution, there is growing interest in understanding their properties as naturally derived, biodegradable, biocompatible, solid-state materials with tailorable properties influenced by environmental parameters. Therapeutic applications comprise an important new research field; particularly in gene transfection using plasmid DNA with targeted local delivery for use in cell culture. Nucleic acid-surfactant films are fairly simple to prepare and can be produced on a large scale, depending on the source of DNA or RNA. A DNA-lipid complex is produced by mixing solutions of the nucleic acid and lipid in water, causing a water-insoluble complex to precipitate. The complex is then dried, dissolved in an organic solvent such as isopropanol, and cast on a solid substrate to form a self-standing film via slow solvent evaporation. However while the films are considered to have promising applications in such diverse fields as drug delivery, photonics, and biocomputation, the structure of the films was a controversial subject in the literature. Furthermore the degradation of such films under biological conditions and in media/serum was not well understood. The structure of a DNA-dimethyldidodecylammonium bromide (DDAB) film in the dry state and in water was investigated by various materials science techniques. We were intrigued to discover that the film could exist in two different structural states and could alternate between these two states rapidly as the film was wetted and dried. The film structure was described further under the influence of humidity and temperature which yielded the discovery of a third structural state. Finally we investigated the application of the films for gene delivery using a luciferase expression assay. We determined that the films as commonly fabricated are not suitable for biological applications as the DNA and lipid separate from each other in the presence of salt buffer due to charge screening, thus exposing the DNA to degradation by nucleases resulting in low transfection levels. While the films may be further modified to improve their transfection yield we believe that a great deal of further research would be required to achieve this goal.",,,
1335,Phase Stability of Zirconia-Based Thermal Barrier Coatings,"Zirconia-based ceramics have long been used to provide thermal protection to the structural components of modern gas turbine engines. Economic and environmental considerations have motivated higher engine operating temperatures, potentially leading to more rapid degradation of thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems dependent on a metastable phase, namely t'-8YSZ (ZrO 2+7-8wt%YO1.5) TBCs. The t'-phase was originally thought to decay slowly into the equilibrium yttria-lean tetragonal phase and yttria-rich cubic phase, the former of which may undergo further transformation to the monoclinic phase. The present study shows that the t'-phase rapidly decomposes into a coherent array of Y-rich and Y-lean domains at a small fraction of the time necessary to form the deleterious monoclinic phase. However, because of the constraint imposed by the interfaces and surrounding domains, this is not detectable via XRD until the domains have coarsened considerably. The coherent nature of the interfaces also plays an important role in delaying the onset of the monoclinic transformation by limiting the coarsening rate of Y-lean domains. Coherency strain not only influences the coarsening rate of the microstructure, but may also be responsible for the development of a strain induced spinodal region---a concept that accommodates the currently accepted thermodynamic description of the system as well as the microstructural observations. The rapid decay of t'-YSZ into a modulated microstructure of coherent domains offers additional insight on the importance of microstructural control in the phase evolution of YSZ TBCs. However, examination of evolution in several typical TBC microstructures reveals that development and retention of the modulated microstructure is subject to the initial microstructural morphology. Larger initial grain size and chemical homogeneity of the initial microstructure were closely correlated to the formation of a modulated microstructure---concomitantly, leading to a delay in the onset of the monoclinic transformation. Stemming from this comparison, potential pathways for further delaying the onset of the monoclinic transformation have been identified. While the effectiveness of these measures is expected to be modest, lessons have been learned from the t'-8YSZ system. The desire to understand and control phase stability in the 8YSZ system is related to the importance of maintaining a high degree of tetragonality over the entire range of relevant temperatures. This is key to supporting or improving the in service toughness and durability. As such, a novel TBC system has been developed in which a relatively large single phase tetragonal field with exceptional tetragonality is stabilized and has demonstrated comparable or improved toughness, making it a promising alternative for next generation TBCs.",,,
1336,Etchless Core-Definition Process for the Realization of Low Loss Glass Waveguides,"Optical waveguides integrated onto microchips form some of the major components that enable the optical communication system we now use for our Internet, television and communication systems around the world, and are soon to be replacing some of the electrical components in high-speed computers. Deployed optical fibers form a web that spans the globe due to the very low loss of light - less than a decibel per kilometer. Chip-scale waveguides, on the other hand, typically exhibit losses 3-5 orders of magnitude higher - a few decibels per centimeter! In an attempt to unleash the potential of photonics in the numerous applications rendered unfeasible by these high losses, we have taken a systematic approach to understanding, modeling and improving the loss mechanisms in optical waveguides. We follow the path of optical fibers by focusing on glass-based designs, in particular the silicon dioxide/silicon oxynitride (SiO2/SiO xNy) material platform. In addition to a materials study of a number of deposited glasses, and the development of simulation tools for the major loss mechanisms, we have developed a process to tackle the largest loss contributor - sidewall roughness of waveguide cores. We demonstrate for the first time a process for the selective oxidation of silicon oxynitride, which converts high index core SiOxN y into cladding SiO2 via a thermal oxidation. We thoroughly characterize the wet oxidation process, and apply this to the fabrication of optical waveguides. We discuss the underlying chemistry behind the oxidation process, which affects the shape and index of the resulting materials. We propose a model for the smoothing of waveguide sidewalls by oxidant diffusion, and present the most recent results obtained with this novel process. Additionally, we present an iterative process for optimizing the waveguide structure for propagation loss, using a non-destructive loss measurement scheme based on Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR) and subsequent re-oxidations. This trimming technique, enabled by the oxidation process, is applicable to all glass waveguide foundries that use SiOxNy or Si 3N4 materials for waveguide cores.",,,
1337,Mixed and Mixed: Inheritance and Intersectionality in the Identity Formation and Identity Migration of People with Mexican and Other Ethnoracial Backgrounds,"Approximately 25%--38% of Mexican Americans marry someone of another race or ethnicity. There has been little scholarly attention devoted, though, to where people with Mexican and other ethnoracial backgrounds fit within ethnoracial paradigms. Framed within historical and contemporary mestiz and multiracial identity theories, I gathered data through oral histories with Central and Northern California individuals as well as archival, oral history, and autoethnographic research on multiple generations of my Vermont family. The study contextualizes California narrators' identity formations within familial, community, and national histories to argue that, despite thorough boundary policing by monoethnically identified Mexican American and other communities, narrators inherited familial, community, cultural, sexual, and personal resources that modeled first- and multigenerational ethnoracial mixing as common and/or the integration of binaries as possible. Such models facilitated narrators' development of their own integrated mixed race, Mexican-descent identities, which they achieved by actively developing one or more of five tool patterns. The study also addresses the issue of ethnoracial identity migration, and employs an ecological approach to examine how changes in certain intersectional identity vectors (e.g., age, class, geography, and family dynamics) can lead to minor or major ethnoracial identity migrations. Furthermore, I analyze the history of ethnoracial identity over three generations of my Vermont family in terms of the models, tool patterns, and intersectional vector analyses from above, via the overarching framework of my own identity experiences. Such work ultimately requires me to redefine ""success"" and ""failure"" in my historical inquiry, moving from ""fact"" to antiracist, feminist intervention in my family's ethnoracial memory. The comparative nature of the study is distinctive. First, most studies about the multiracial Mexican-descent community thus far have each looked at one ethnoracial heritage combination (e.g. Mexipino, Punjabi Mexican American, White/Mexican), whereas this study attends to multiple ""Mexican-and"" backgrounds. This provides important insight into how particular inter-community histories influence the articulation of Mexican American and multiracial identities. Second, I redefine ""Mexican American""/""Chican "" as contemporarily (first-, second-, or third+-generation), rather than only historically, mixed. At the same time, however, I position multigenerational inheritance as central to the ethnoracial self-making of people with contemporarily mixed backgrounds.",,,
1338,"Fabrication, Micro-structural Analysis, and Mechanical Testing of High Density Polymeric Foam","Foams, or what are often called cellular solids, are some of the most widely used materials in the modern era. In general, foam is a porous substance formed by the introduction of gas filled pores into condensed matter; the result is typically a light weight substance with properties related to the base (non-porous) medium. Applications of foams include: vibration dampening, energy mitigation (such as packaging and bike helmets), insulation, filtration, and flotation. The focus of this work is on the properties of flexible elastomeric foam of high relative-density. The bulk of existing literature on elastomeric foam is concerned with foam of low relative-density (ratio of the foam density to the density of the material from which the foam is formed _ 0.1). The relationship between the micro-structure of high relative-density foam and its mechanical response has, in large part, not been subjected to systematic investigation heretofore. The present work examines how the micro-structural features of pore shape, size, and location affect the macro-structural response of relative high density foam to compressive loading. In order to carry out this study, methods were developed and employed to control a foam's micro-structure, and hence its mechanical response, with the use of temporary pore forming particles and micron scale inclusions. Advanced microscopy techniques were used to observe, in situ, the evolution of a foam's micro-structure under compressive loading, and the results were correlated with the evolution of the foam's stress -- strain response. Additionally, quantitative methods were developed and employed to describe numerically the foam's micro-structural features, such as: (i), pore shape, (ii), pore size, and (iii), the arrangement of the pores with respect to each other. Numerous foams were produced, tested, and subjected to the methodology developed for this study.",,,
1339,"Examining Faculty Satisfaction, Productivity, and Collegiality in Higher Education: Contemporary Contexts and Modern Methods","In response to current discourse surrounding faculty accountability and diversity, this dissertation describes three separate studies of faculty satisfaction, productivity, and collegiality in higher education. Using national faculty data, the studies employed advanced quantitative methods including structural equation modeling, multi-level models, and latent class analysis to analyze and interpret faculty data at four-year colleges and universities. The three studies also examined differences by gender, race/ethnicity, tenure status, and institutional type. The first study revealed a strong, positive, and highly significant relationship between campus racial climate and faculty satisfaction at the individual level of analysis, regardless of gender, race/ethnicity, and tenure status. Further, women and racial/ethnic minority held significantly more negative perceptions of campus racial climate at the individual level. Campus faculty attitudes regarding campus racial climate and faculty satisfaction at the institutional level were positively related to faculty perceptions at the individual level. The second study empirically identified five distinct classes of faculty productivity, with respect to gender, race, institutional type, and levels of faculty satisfaction. The classes revealed complex patterns of teaching and research productivity and were labeled as follows: Research-Focused Faculty, Balanced Faculty, Teaching-Focused Faculty, High Teaching with Moderate Research Faculty, and Developing Research Faculty (listed in order of highest to lowest mean levels of faculty satisfaction). White and male faculty were more likely to be represented in the Research-Focused Faculty Class, and non-White faculty were more likely to be represented in the Developing Research Faculty class. Female faculty were also more likely to be represented in the Balanced Faculty and Teaching-Focused Faculty classes. The third and final study examined the relationships among faculty collegiality, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions. Significant findings indicated that faculty collegiality was strongly and positively related to job satisfaction, and negatively related to turnover intentions, regardless of gender and race/ethnicity. Women faculty and faculty of color indicated lower levels of collegiality, and faculty of color reported lower job satisfaction and higher turnover intentions.",,,
1340,Risks and Needs of Participants in Batterer Intervention Programs,"This mixed-methods research study applied the Risk and Need principles of the Risk-Needs-Responsivity (RNR) Theory to men and women court-ordered to participate in Batterer Intervention Programs (BIPs) operated through a Southern California county Domestic Violence Court. Risk for re-offense and need for treatment for substance abuse, trauma, and psychological distress were assessed in 178 men and women. Outcome measures were participant satisfaction with treatment and program completion. Of the 178 surveyed, 70 completed the satisfaction survey while still in treatment, which included open-ended qualitative responses. These 70 participants were also assessed for additional treatment need: Domestic Violence Prevention Education. Program completion status was obtained on another 73. Results showed considerable variation in risk and need factors among participants, such that four different groups emerged: Low risk and need, Low risk and High need, High risk and Low need, and High risk and need. Neither risk nor need for treatment predicted either satisfaction with treatment or program completion. However, post-hoc analyses revealed significant differences between each of the four BIPs in terms of program completion and treatment satisfaction. In particular, one BIP that provided culturally sensitive treatment had a markedly higher program completion rate than did the others. Also, participants who had been married were more likely to complete treatment than those who had not. Finally, qualitative analysis of participant responses demonstrated that a majority of participants appreciated learning skills through the program. Those most satisfied appeared to gain some self-awareness, while those least satisfied had more suggestions for how to improve the treatment program to better meet their needs. Implications for practice, policy, and research are discussed.",,,
1341,Androgens and energy allocation: How variation in androgen levels can promote fitness-enhancing behaviors,"A growing body of research suggests that androgens may function to adaptively regulate energy allocation in men. This model holds that androgens direct energy towards systems associated with reproductive effort, and so should be upregulated in circumstances where such investment is fitness-enhancing. The present studies were designed to directly test this model, as well as identify the cognitive and physiological systems that might be subject to calibration via androgens. Genetic variance in men's sensitivity to androgens was associated with outcomes that depend on investment in reproductive effort, such as strength and status seeking. Transient increases in men's androgen levels also predicted changes in domains associated with reproductive effort, like risk-taking and future discounting. The magnitude of these increases was associated with the likely payoffs of reproductive effort in the circumstance that elicited them. Taken together, these results generally support the argument that androgens control energy allocation in fitness-enhancing ways.",,,
1342,Spintronics and Quantum Information Processing in Wide-Bandgap Semiconductors,"Spin is a quantum-mechanical angular momentum intrinsic to many particles, including electrons, neutrons, and protons. Just as the charge of an electron has been exploited widely for modern technological gain, the spin of an electron may find future use in a number of advanced information technologies pursued by researchers within the fields of spintronics and quantum information. However, the future success of spin-based technologies relies heavily on identifying materials systems where spins can be easily manipulated with a high degree of quantum control, while remaining relatively robust to outside sources of quantum decoherence that tend to irreversibly alter the quantum state of the spins in an uncontrollable way. Towards these ends, we explore the physics of electronic spins in wide-bandgap semiconductors, which are semiconductors with bandgap energies roughly 2.0 eV or larger. First, we study the spins of spatially-delocalized conduction band electrons in gallium nitride, to determine whether they can be polarized electronically without the use of magnetic fields or magnetic materials. We use optical techniques to show that, despite the rather weak spin-orbit coupling expected to exist in gallium nitride, a current-induced spin polarization can still be observed in electronic Hall bar devices fabricated from bulk n-type epilayers of this material. We then turn our attention to highly-localized electronic spins that are bound to point defects within wide-bandgap semiconductors. Past studies in diamond have shown that a point defect known as the nitrogen-vacancy center possesses an electronic spin state that can be used as an individually-addressable quantum bit even at room temperature. However, no other defect systems with analogous properties were known to exist. We develop a set of screening criteria that can be used in conjunction with computational simulations to systematically identify defects similar to the diamond nitrogen-vacancy center, but in other semiconductors that can be grown and microfabricated more easily than diamond. We identify several promising defects in a variety of semiconductors, focusing in particular on vacancy-related defects in silicon carbide. As a result of these predictions, we engage in several optical and magnetic resonance studies of the 4H polytype of silicon carbide. We succeed in identifying six new species of point defect that can be used as spin qubits in analogy to the diamond nitrogen-vacancy center, with two of these defects exhibiting room temperature operation.",,,
1344,Iranian American Youth and the Limits of Assimilation,"In light of current anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-Iranian, and anti-Middle Eastern developments across the U.S. and Europe, processes of assimilation are gravely under-theorized and inadequately problematized in contemporary research on diasporic Iranians. With this dissertation, I bring needed attention to the ways in which the Iranian case complicates sociological understandings of assimilation, whiteness, and racialization in the contemporary United States. Drawing from over 80 in-depth interviews and more than 750 hours of ethnographic research among Iranian-heritaged teenagers and young adults (ages 13--28), I argue that Iranian identity in the U.S. takes shape within a fundamental dissonance between the community's legal ethno-racial classification as ""white"" and its lived experiences of specificity and subordination in relation to racial projects like the U.S.-led War on Terror. I assess youth-driven phenomenon in three case studies: the micro-level interactions that contest empire and race in one Title VI-funded ""critical"" Persian language classroom; the collective forms of ""inherited nostalgia"" developed in a University Middle Eastern Resource Center; and the construction of new forms of ethnic humor at a diasporic summer camp. The analysis across these case studies challenges existing scholarship that relies on theories of cultural trauma and stigma to assert a vision of Iranian American youth seeking entry to a white and normatively ""American"" ethno-racial formation. Instead, I present evidence of push and pull factors away from assimilationist practices: these range from prejudice and discrimination deployed by others whose white and ""American"" identities are uncontested, through acts of cultural resistance, both small and large, that situate ""Iranianness"" as a powerful marker of ethno-racial specificity in an increasingly hostile social and political climate. For these youth, who in fact largely self-identify as racial, ethnic, and religious minorities in the U.S. setting, it is precisely the cultural and social practices they mark as ""Iranian"" or proudly ""unassimilable,"" which serve as powerful source material for self-confidence, social activism, civic enfranchisement, cross-racial solidarity, and transnational belonging.",,,
1345,Redundancy and the Recursive Feed-forward Architecture of Endodermal Gene Regulation in Caenorhabditis elegans,"Early developmental transitions, such as the specification-to-differentiation switch, are critical for successful embryogenesis in multi-cellular animals. For such transitions to occur regularly and robustly, each cell in the embryo must integrate an ensemble of inputs and then generate appropriate outputs that faithfully translate the many inputs despite transcriptional noise. Studies of endoderm development in the nematode worm C. elegans presented here demonstrate that a synergy of redundant partners is required both in the transition from specification to differentiation, which relies on redundant GATA factors END-1 (historically identified as a specification factor) and ELT-7 (a downstream differentiation factor) and at the initiation of differentiation, directed by redundant GATA factors ELT-7 and ELT-2. Subsequent study of the many instances of genetic redundancy found in endoderm development have revealed that the gene regulatory network directing intestinal fate may be best modeled as a recursive series of interlocking feed-forward modules. This model offers a satisfactory explanation for the pervasive theme of genetic redundancy observed in Caenorhabditis and provides a mechanism by which high fidelity is ensured in the invariant cell lineage of the rapidly developing C. elegans embryo.",,,
1346,"Meaning, Markets, and Social Practice in Book Publishing","The sociological analysis of cultural production draws from an array of theoretical approaches, including work in economic sociology, organizational sociology, and the sociology of culture. The Production of Culture (PofC) approach, an application of organizational theory to culture producing industries, is dominant. Relying on three case studies in the American trade book publishing industry, this dissertation brings three recent theoretical moves to bear on original data: (1) the interaction of institutions, cognitions, and networks in suppressing and fomenting evolutions in the literary field, (2) the collision of competing institutional logics in acquisition decisions for literary trade manuscripts, and (3) the on-the-ground negotiation of meaning with regards to both text and context during processes of genre assignment for a single manuscript. In total, the work signals future directions not only for the study of the book trade, but also for the study of cultural production.",,,
1347,Indian summer monsoon variability during the last glacial (95-25 kyr BP),"Resolving abrupt Indian summer monsoon (ISM) changes in the past is critical to understanding major forces that modulate Indian summer monsoon variability. Mixed layer dwelling planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber (white) from core material retrieved from the northern Bay of Bengal, tropical Indian Ocean, were used to create a record of Ba/Ca, Mg/Ca, and delta 18O variations. Time-series of Ba/Ca-based sea surface salinity (SSS), delta 18O of sea water, and Mg/Ca-based sea surface temperature are used to investigate millennial-scale variability of the ISM and its relationship to Bay of Bengal sea surface temperature through the last glacial (95--25 kyr BP). The proxy records indicate that the ISM responded sensitively to rapid changes in oceanic and atmospheric perturbation. Intensification of ISM, as indicated by a decrease in runoff-induced SSS, corresponds to episodes of warm air temperature over Greenland, known as Dangaard-Oeschger (DO) interstadials. Concomitant to Heinrich events our record indicates an abrupt weakening of ISM. A weak correlation between Ba/Ca-based SSS and Mg/Ca-based sea surface temperature indicates a decoupling between SST and Indian summer monsoon precipitation during millennial-scale events. Divergences in the timing, pace, and magnitude of Ba/Ca-based SSS and delta18Olocal seawater (temperature and ice volumes components removed) reveals local delta 18O changes related to ISM variability are likely caused by many factors. Furthermore, the record of delta18Oresidual that has been established by removing the ice volume, temperature, and salinity components from foraminiferal delta18O, suggests that decline in monsoon strength was accompanied by an increase in the delta18 O of precipitation during northern high-latitude stadials. Dissimilarity between the Ba/Ca-based SSS and delta18Olocal seawater records as well as significant delta18Oresidual variability suggest the imprint of millennial-scale ISM changes on the delta18O record may be more complicated than previously thought. An enrichment of delta18Oresidual is present during Heinrich events. One possible explanation for this observation is that concomitant to the decline in monsoon precipitation the isotope composition of precipitation was significantly enriched, most likely suggesting changes in source and pathway of the moisture. Therefore, reconstruction of past ISM changes solely on basis of delta18O records may lead to inaccurate assessment of precipitation change. Overall, the record from the northern Bay of Bengal indicates that the ISM responds very sensitively to changes in millennial-scale northern high-latitude temperature and ice sheet instability.",,,
1348,Distributed Smoothing Based on Relative Measurements,"This work focuses on the problem of estimating the locations of mobile agents by agent displacement measurements with agent relative position measurements. The problem of distributed Kalman smoothing for this application is reformulated as a parameter estimation problem. The graph structure underlying the reformulated problem makes it computable in a distributed manner using iterative methods of solving linear equations. The first part of this dissertation presents a smoothing algorithm that computes an approximation of the centralized optimal estimates. The algorithm is distributed in the sense that each agent can estimate its own position by communication only with nearby agents. With finite memory and limited number of iterations before new measurements are obtained, the algorithm produces an approximation of the Kalman smoother estimates. As the memory of each agent and the number of iterations between each time step are increased, the approximation improves. The error covariances of the location estimates produced by the proposed algorithm are significantly lower than what is possible if inter-agent relative position measurements are not available. The second part of this dissertation presents an algorithm that reduces communication for a class of distributed estimation problems, which includes the aforementioned smoothing algorithm. Herein, the agents are viewed as nodes in a graph and the relative measurements between agents are viewed as the graph's edges. The algorithm exploits the existence of cycles in the graph to compute the best linear state estimates. For large graphs, the algorithm significantly reduces the total number of message exchanges that are needed to obtain an optimal estimate. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge for planar graphs and provide explicit formulas for its convergence rate for regular lattices.",,,
1350,World Music and the Individual: the Negotiation of Cultural Capital and Identity Through Bossa Nova in the United States,"This inquiry looks at the reception and consumption of a particular musical import in twenty-first century United States: bossa nova. Using theories of cultural capital, Othering or exoticization, and treatment of ""world music,"" especially as it factors into evolving hegemonic systems, I argue that the employment of cultural capital in the current moment has less to do with identification and separation of Others, and more to do with a sense of global citizenry. This argument is also based on seven ethnographies: four performers, two listeners/consumers, and one sample fan base. From these ethnographies emerge trends indicative of an accelerated globalization, which not only functions as a hegemonic system, but also substitutes new modes of consumption and exhibition of cultural capital. Ultimately, these world music creators and consumers are increasingly fashioning their musical and social identities based upon the melange that the Internet now so easily facilitates, versus an older and more hierarchical juxtapositioning of self and Other.",,,

Lawrence's ""The Plumed Serpent"", Graham Greene's ""The Power and the Glory"" and Malcolm Lowry's ""Under the Volcano""","D. H. Lawrence, Graham Greene and Malcolm Lowry traveled individually to Mexico during the 1920s and 1930s. In their respective trips, these three authors tried to know and analyze not only the place but the people who lived in it. After months---even years---of traveling, the three authors went back to their experiences in Mexico to create The Plumed Serpent (1926), The Power and the Glory (1940), and Under the Volcano (1947), respectively. Three English novels situated in Mexican space. The impact that post-colonial studies have had in understanding the imposed perspective of previous empires over other regions makes it impossible to sustain that this representation of the other is ""transparent"", that it's not mediated by form. Some concepts belonging to the study of rhetorical analysis---such as focalization and characterization---allow me to discover the different points of view that are at play in the creation of stories that describe a space not only unknown to the reader, but even new within the literary universe that subscribes them. These three novels inherit almost directly the narratives of exploration and travel of the 16th and 17th centuries. Therefore, they reflect an old narrative tradition of writing about what has been explored, of knowing a space and then recreating it in words as the background for travels that have been lived. This project focuses in revealing the rhetorical techniques used by the authors to transform Mexico into the setting for different narrative worlds. By referring their readers continually to a country that has been visited, explored and surveyed by themselves, the writers contribute to the formation of one coherent narrative universe whose meaning is distributed throughout the three novels, but all together conforms what I've called Mexican space. This narrative world was founded by Lawrence, but Greene and Lowry follow in his footsteps and contribute to it. By not only situating their novels in a country that's explicitly referred to as ""Mexico"", but giving them the same thematic background---a religious upheaval---these writers create a consistent image of Mexico as a religious country where modern men go to seek spiritual reconnection in the period between two World Wars. The narrative space created by Lawrence, Greene and Lowry is then equally Mexican and religious, but this qualities are presented through a collection of sites and places that I've grouped for their analyses in four categories: topographical space, social space, religious space and movement. By reading these novels through their spacial representations, I propose a view of Mexico as a trope, a topos, in English literature that was created and solidified in the novels written by Lawrence, Greene and Lowry.",,,
1353,Light Emitting Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte Nanoassemblies for Identification of Bacteria,"Conjugated oligoelectrolytes are finding innovative applications in optical detection. They contain ionic pendent groups that integrate water solubility to the light harvesting properties of the conjugated backbone. These pendent groups also offer an opportunity to bind an electrostatic counterpart, for example, a Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) unit. The combination of an oligoelectrolyte donor and a FRET acceptor affords a highly sensitive optical probe that can be employed in biodetection. Microbial detection and identification was particularly targeted due to its relevance to medicine, biosecurity, and the supply of food and water. This dissertation describes the use of conjugated oligoelectrolytes to generate nanoassemblies for use in bacterial identification and bacterial growth history characterization. An array of nanoassemblies was prepared by electrostatically complexing a cationic oligoelectrolyte with different fluorescein--labeled single--stranded DNA. Studies using atomic force microscopy and fluorescence microscopy confirm their nano-scale size and interaction with the bacterial surface, respectively. The effect of buffer concentration, charge ratio, and oligoelectrolyte concentration used to generate the nanoassemblies, on bacterial response was investigated and optimized using the central composite design and a hybrid artificial neural network model. Excitation of the nanoassemblies produced a photoluminescent spectrum composed of oligoelectrolyte emission and sensitized fluorescein emission. Introduction of bacteria to the nanoassemblies gave rise to perturbations in the photoluminescent spectrum. The collective differential response of the nanoassemblies was used to create a signature pattern that was utilized to identify the bacteria or characterize the bacterial growth history.",,,
1354,Distribution Matching Methods for Parameter Estimation and Model Selection in Computational Biology,"Computational models are increasingly being used to study complex biological systems. Many modeling formalisms have been successfully applied to gene networks and other processes, but the two that have gained the most popularity are certainly ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and stochastic chemical reaction networks (SCRNs). While such models are relatively easy to construct once the structure of the system under study is known, before they can be productively used to reproduce experimental data and make predictions, one critical challenge must be overcome: the determination of the many unknown parameters that will inevitably appear in them. These are numbers such as reaction rates, production and degradation coefficients and so forth, which are often difficult to measure directly. The most common approach is, therefore, to measure other quantities involved in the models, such as concentrations or number of molecules of RNA and proteins, and to use these measurements to infer the parameters indirectly. For these reasons, the problem of parameter estimation represents a central issue in computational biology. In this work, we present a collection of new methods that we developed to tackle this important problem. The key feature behind them is the idea of distribution matching, in which the estimation is achieved by matching pairs of suitably defined probability distributions. Specifically, distributions generated by the models are matched to distributions obtained from the experimental observations in order to obtain the unknown parameters. We additionally show how the same theoretical tools we introduced for parameter estimation can also address the problem of model selection , in which one has to choose to best model for a given process from a list of candidates. This is a very common concern in biological applications, since the interactions among the different component of a system may be not fully known. The use of our proposed methods is demonstrated through several examples, including one in which actual experimental data was collected. Our techniques are found to perform better than existing approaches in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, or both, and they are readily applicable to realistic estimation problems in computational biology.",,,
1355,Effects of Video Feedback on Parent Implementation of Pivotal Response Treatment,"A myriad of parent education treatment approaches for parents of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been developed. Behavioral parent education programs are associated with positive parent outcomes because, as parents learn behavior modification techniques, they increase reciprocal positive interactions with their child, decrease stress, and increase confidence. Furthermore, parent education programs are associated with child gains in communication and social behavior and decreases in disruptive behavior. The parents' involvement is critical; it facilitates the generalization and maintenance of the child's skills. Despite the critical nature of parent education programs, however, not all parents benefit equally from these programs. Unfortunately, there are relatively few studies that directly address how to conduct parent education sessions, especially for the parents who continue to struggle with the intervention techniques. Literature in related fields has found that video feedback facilitates learning through the process of self-observation and that such feedback results in improved performance. In light of these positive findings, this study extended the use of video feedback to parent education for parents of children with autism. To examine the effects of video feedback in parent education, a multiple baseline design across participants was used with parents with a history of not meeting treatment fidelity. This approach was evaluated to examine the impact on parents, children, and parent education variables. Results indicate that the incorporation of video feedback into parent education for parents of children with ASD yields positive results. Specifically, all three parents met treatment fidelity and displayed positive levels of affect, increased confidence, decreased parenting stress, increased parental self-efficacy, and reported satisfaction with the intervention. Children displayed higher levels of affect and improved outcomes. The type (e.g., constructive versus positive and general versus specific) and amount of feedback delivered by the clinician did not significantly differ between the conditions. Finally, findings suggest that the parents increased their amount of self-reflective feedback statements. Results are discussed in terms of the implications for the use of video feedback in parent education programs and the theoretical underpinnings of parent change.",,,
1356,William of Ockham and the Opening of Phenomenology,"In recent decades there has been renewed interest in the role of late-medieval nominalism in genealogies of modern thought. William of Ockham, 14th century theologian and philosopher, often plays a pivotal role in such accounts. Ockham has been both credited and blamed for the overthrow of medieval metaphysics and the foundation of empirical science. He has also occasioned all sorts of vituperation for his voluntarist theology and his purported skepticism. Such censure has made it difficult for scholars to appreciate Ockham's philosophical contributions in their own right, especially outside the discipline of Medieval Studies. The dissertation seeks to remedy this state of affairs by examining the philosophical significance of Ockham's work, focusing on his theory of cognition and its implications for philosophical research. The dissertation argues that Ockham's theory of cognition inaugurates a subjective ""turn"" that can be traced through Immanuel Kant to modern phenomenology. Rather than ""founding"" the modern (Kantian) subject, however, Ockham also opens the subject to the possibility that it is always already un -founded in relation to the givenness of phenomena. Thus the dissertation makes two interventions into now common characterizations of modernity as a closed system, predicated on the Cartesian or Kantian subject and ripe for overthrow by post-metaphysical criticism. First, it locates the ""modern"" subject as far back as William of Ockham. Second, it argues that the modern ""subject"" is un-founded in its very foundation. That is, the modern subject is two-sided: self-founding yet un-founded in its relation to phenomena. The dissertation defends this reading of Ockham and tests it by exploring similar instabilities in Immanuel Kant's theory of subjectivity.",,,
1357,Medium Nature: American Poetry in the Suburban Age,"What is the relationship between the habitats a culture chooses to build and the forms of experience available to its members? Can poetry train us to pay keener attention to our surroundings, especially their nonhuman aspects we usually call nature? Situated between World War II and the 1970s, this project explores those two questions by looking at how Wallace Stevens, Richard Hugo, Sylvia Plath, and John Ashbery represent and critique midcentury America's dominant built environment: the suburbs. White, middle-class suburbia was rooted in pseudo-pastoral ideology according to which a family expresses its prosperity through control of a modest, manicured swatch of nature around its home. But suburbia is actually industrialized pastoral, supported by an infrastructure of cheap oil, easy credit, landscaping firms, asphalt roads, corporatized food production, water-supply regimes, and transnational media. The poets considered here understand ""medium nature"" (a term from Stevens) in two ways as they develop a set of mobile imaginative practices that can ultimately describe modified environments outside of this project's temporal and cultural frame. First, they delineate spaces where nature appears in stylized, commodified, fragmentary forms like golf courses, city parks, lawns gorged on petrochemicals, ornamental poplars, house pets, or flower troughs outside supermarkets. These places often seem---and often are---stale, artificialized, even poisoned, because they are saturated with technologies and their byproducts. Yet nonhuman phenomena are not entirely absent from the suburbs, a fact that helps us think beyond rigid binaries like city/country and nature/culture. Though problematic, suburbia renders visible the links between cultural practices and material contexts. These practices include poetry itself, which, Chapter Two contends, Stevens theorizes as a hybrid of imagination and biotic fact using material drawn from West Hartford, the wealthy suburb where he wrote most of his poems. Thus, contends the more theoretical and historicist Chapter One, suburbs revive the term ""nature"" in the face of recent dismissals by some philosophers. Second, ""medium"" frames nature as a matrix though which humans form relationships with one another; these poets explore the sociopolitical geographies coded into suburban landscapes. Chapter Three takes up Richard Hugo, whose poetry asserts that the construction of auto-centric transportation networks hurts marginalized groups more than others, in his work's case Nisei farmers whose land was stolen during the war and used to build new suburban infrastructures outside Seattle. Chapter Four uses Plath's journals, letters, and poems to argue that her Gothic version of pastoral disrupts the routines of middle-class life by ironizing the attendant belief that nature can be privatized, commodified, and managed, a move that is clearest in Ariel. Chapter Five examines how Ashbery extends suburbanized modernity's fetish for environmental control to an absurd end. Instead of tidy green space, Ashbery sees a bricolage of junk and ersatz nature. His airless, grimly comical dioramas evoke the way economic stagnation, social anomie, and anxieties about pollution damaged the suburban dream during the 1970s, which mark the close of its ostensible golden age.",,,
1358,Religious Victimization as Social Empowerment in Narratives of Discrimination from California's Proposition 8 Campaign,"One of the premier social issues in contemporary US politics is that of same-sex marriage. This research explores language use and identity construction by same-sex marriage supporters through narratives of discrimination. This thesis analyzes data collected through the non-profit Marriage Equality USA, wherein narrators respond to a survey question about experiences of discrimination during California's Proposition 8 campaign, a statewide initiative that repealed the rights of same-sex couples to marry. In doing so, narrators use ideologies of religion and religious affiliation to: (1) construct a victim identity in relation to their experiences, (2) use this as a springboard to challenge their victimization, (3) establish opposition between individual and institutional positioning of religious identity, and (4) switch roles with their victimizers with respect to victim and empowered positions. In doing so, narrators use victimization as empowerment to convey a progressive position in an inevitably successful social movement.",,,
1360,Twentieth-Century Trajectories of Female Desire: From Delmira Agustini to Lucia Etxebarria,"This dissertation assesses the inscription of female desire in the context of literature written in Spanish throughout the twentieth century in the works of Delmira Agustini, Juana de Ibarbourou, Carmen Laforet, Carmen Olle and Lucia Etxebarria. In considering these five authors I pay attention to publications in the Spanish language that need to be understood within the field of Hispanism and within gender or feminist studies. I argue that despite their many differences, all of the authors share approaches that transgress the boundaries of heteronormative discourse with regards to the definition, expression, and understanding of female desire. I use a theoretical framework that traces the development of the theories of female desire of feminist thinkers including Luce Irigaray, Helene Cixous, Monique Wittig, Adrienne Rich, Judith Butler, Candace West, Don Zimmerman, and Sarah Fenstermaker, and I include a discussion of postfeminism in the context of the late twentieth century by looking at the theories of Angela McRobbie as they pertain to Lucia Etxebarria. I develop a concept of what I define as the ""mis-citation"" of normative gender and desire in literature and the way that through mis-citing these norms these works create a space of agency for the expression of alternative desires and genders. This study in part follows the massive changes with regards to the female desiring subject that occurred over the span of the twentieth century in the context of literature written in Spanish, transformations that were advanced by these five innovative authors.",,,
1361,Cost Effective Error Detection for SoC Validation and Online Testing,"Error detection is the vital component of the quality assurance tasks during the life time of an integrated circuit to avoid costly in-field failures and massive product recall. Nevertheless, sufficiently thorough error checking requires the development of high quality tests and on-chip checkers that can themselves be very expensive. How to detect all the errors while minimizing the cost remains one of the most challenging and critical questions for the semiconductor research community. This dissertation attempts to address this issue by proposing several cost effective error detection techniques targeting the stages of post-silicon validation and online testing. First, a time-multiplexed checking scheme is proposed to accommodate on-chip hardware checkers with low overhead. The same hardware resource for checker implementation can be used as a design-for-debug (DfD) structure for post-silicon debugging and later reused as a design-for-testability (DfT) resource during online testing. Case studies and mathematical analyses demonstrates the schemes provide high error coverage and a significant reduction in chip area and power overhead for on-chip checkers at the cost of increased fault detection latency. Second, a series of test evaluation metrics are proposed based on error models of electrical bugs and data mining based fault-model-free approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the intelligent navigation of validation test plan based on relevant bug model or knowledge mined from post-silicon test data can prioritize those tests capable of uncovering more silicon timing errors, resulting in significant reduction of validation time and effort.",,,
1362,"Bacterial exposure to metal-oxide nanoparticles: Methods, physical interactions, and biological effects","Nanotechnology is a major endeavor of this century, with proposed applications in fields ranging from agriculture to energy to medicine. Nanoscale titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) is among the most widely produced nanoparticles worldwide, and already exists in consumer products including impermanent personal care products and surface coatings. Inevitably, nano-TiO2 will be transported into the environment via consumer or industrial waste, where its effects on organisms are largely unknown. Out of concern for the possible ill-effects of nanoparticles in the environment, there is now a field of study in nanotoxicology. Bacteria are ideal organisms for nanotoxicology research because they are environmentally important, respond rapidly to intoxication, and provide evidence for effects in higher organisms. My doctoral research focuses on the effects and interactions of nano-TiO2 in aqueous systems with planktonic bacteria. This dissertation describes four projects and the outcomes of the research: (1) A discovery, using a combination of environmental- and cryogenic-scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS), that initially agglomerated nano-TiO2 is dispersed upon bacterial contact, as nanoparticles preferentially sorbed to cell surfaces. (2) Establishment of a method to disperse nanoparticles in an aqueous culture medium for nanotoxicology studies. A combination of electrostatic repulsion, steric hindrance and sonication yielded a high initial level of nano-TiO2 dispersion (i.e. < 300 nm average agglomerate size) and reduced nanoparticle sedimentation. The approach is described in the context of general considerations for dispersion that are transferable to other nanoparticle and media chemistries. (3) Assessment and optimization of optically-based assays to simultaneously study effects of nanoparticles on bacterial membranes (membrane potential, membrane permeability, and electron transport chain function) and generation of reactive oxygen species. A systematic, widely-transferable approach was developed to test and account for nanoparticle interferences with available assays. (4) Using the assay system above, discovery of the influences of nano-TiO 2 primary particle size and iron doping on the effects that nano-TiO 2 has on E. coli growth and membrane processes. Together, this research is towards: better understanding outcomes of interactions between nanoparticles and bacteria, advancing methods in the relatively new field of nanotoxicology that are transferable to other nanoparticle and media chemistries, and improving our understanding of structure-activity relationships (e.g. size and doping effects) leading to intoxication in environmental organisms.",,,
1363,"Reflexive Minds, Phenomenal Bodies: The Birth of Aesthetic Experience in Mid-Victorian Literature","This dissertation offers an account of the missing critical link between Romanticism's transcendent sublime and the ""art-for-art's-sake"" of the Aestheticist movement. We begin with the question, quite simply, of what aesthetic experience meant in the intervening Mid-Victorian period (1830-1880). Working across genre, I offer a theory of the Mid-Victorian aesthetic through a reading of the works of Charlotte Bronte, George Eliot, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. These authors defined aesthetic experience as a materialization of the self-reflexive mind and embedded the moral purposes of their works in this transformative ideal. The phenomenon of a mind actively exerting agency over its own movements, or actively observant of itself is represented in the novels and poetry of this period as a direct product of what happens to a subject absorbed in sensuous form. The marked duality of feeling and judgment in these textual moments (experienced on the level of what the Victorians themselves called ""non-conscious cerebration"") explains the Victorian period as a bridge between the 18th century aesthetics of attitude (promoted by Hume, Kant, Schiller and Shaftesbury) and the 20th-century aesthetics of experience (culminating in expressionist art and the Modernist moment of Joyce and Woolf). Two things make this self-reflexive aesthetic unique. The first is the very ordinary, intimate contexts in which aesthetic experience begins to takes place - whether in Jane Eyre's every-day act of dressing her body, or in the forms of frost Hopkins' noted on the urinal walls of his seminary. The second novel aspect is the potential for such unforeseen apprehensions of sensuous form (unforeseen, to some extent, because they occur in such ordinary contexts) to disrupt and re-form a subject's definition of selfhood. Aesthetics in Mid-Victorian literature is therefore not a flight from the world; it is a means to embody characters, speakers, and readers alike in live systems of relation and meaning, whether these be Eliot's ""larger social faith,"" Tennyson's ideal of communal purpose, or Hopkins's Catholicism.",,,
1364,Transformers: Chinese Self-Cultivation Traditions in Taiwan's Falun Gong,"The current work considers the phenomenon of Falun Dafa through a textual analysis of the major texts of the movement's founder, Li Hongzhi, as well as through an ethnographic study performed amongst practitioners in Taipei, Taiwan. Through an application of Michel Foucault's methodologies of genealogy and ethics, the current work seeks to understand both how and why practitioners submit themselves to and carry out the program of ethical development as taught by Li, as well as how they understand their practice and beliefs to relate to, continue and transform other such practices and beliefs throughout the longer history of religions in China, most notable among these Buddhism, Daoism and Confucianism. My study is concerned both with ethics in Michel Foucault's sense of 'morality', which he defines as ""the real behavior of individuals in relation to the rules and values that are recommended to them,"" as well as with the 'ethical work' of Falun Gong that, to again quote Foucault, ""one performs on oneself, not only in order to bring one's conduct into compliance with a given rule, but to attempt to transform oneself into the ethical subject of one's behavior."". What is discovered is that 'good' and 'evil' in the forms of de and karma are understood in Falun Gong to have physical existence and these substances attach to the body in unseen dimensions, but nevertheless cause physical, as well as emotional and psychological, health or illness. Through Falun Gong self-cultivation practice, these physical substances and the body itself are transformed. Practitioners perform their identities as 'cultivators', meeting in groups daily for the physical exercises and weekly for reciting Li's texts and reflecting upon, in a sort of communal confessional, their behavior in their everyday lives in relation to Li's ethical teachings. Fieldwork conducted in these settings allows a glimpse into how practitioners understand their own practice and interpret the events and conditions of their own lives, as well as how they construct and maintain those understandings through social practice. Thus, my study is concerned, finally, with the ways in which Dafa performs 'religious work' in the lives of practitioners.",,,
1366,Dynamics of multicomponent lipid membranes,"We present theoretical and computational descriptions of the dynamics of multicomponent lipid bilayer membranes. These systems are both model systems for ""lipid rafts"" in cell membranes and interesting physical examples of quasi-two-dimensional fluids. Our chief tool is a continuum simulation that uses a phase field to track the composition of the membrane, and solves the hydrodynamic equations exactly using the appropriate Green's function (Oseen tensor) for the membrane. We apply this simulation to describe the diffusion of domains in phase-separated membranes, the dynamics of domain flickering, and the process of phase separation in lipid membranes. We then derive an analytical theory to describe domain flickering that is consistent with our simulation results, and use this to analyze experimental measurements of membrane domains. Through this method, we measure the membrane viscosity solely from fluorescence microscopy measurements. We study phase separation in quasi-two-dimensional membranes in depth with both simulations and scaling theory, and classify the different scaling regimes and morphologies, which differ from pure two-dimensional fluids. Our results may explain previous inconsistent measurements of the dynamical scaling exponent for phase separation in membranes. We also extend our theory beyond the simplest model, including the possibility that the membrane will be viscoelastic, as well as considering the inertia of the membrane and the fluid surrounding the membrane.",,,
1367,"The ""Strong Black Women Collective"": Intergroup delineations among Black and White female friendship social support networks","This study investigated the social support process among Black and White female friendship networks through a social identity perspective. The goal of this study was to identify the conditions under which female friends might serve as conflict multipliers rather than conflict buffers when discussing a conflict between a female friend and her male romantic partner. Traditional social support literature suggests that social support networks can improve the quality of romantic relationships, but this study proposed that female friendship networks can sometimes hurt romantic relationships, particularly the perceived closeness with the male romantic partner. In particular, this study suggests that Black female social support networks may have stronger effects on perceptions of one's male romantic partner compared to White women due to their unique sociocultural history and socialization to be a ""Strong Black Woman."" The composition of Black friends upholding this Strong Black Woman ideal may form a ""Strong Black Woman Collective,"" such that Black friends communicatively reinforce the virtues of strength in one another. It was hypothesized that the strength would affect the social support process, and consequently be associated with lower levels of perceived relational closeness for Black women and their male romantic partners. Two hundred and twenty nine Black and White women completed online survey questionnaires and the data were analyzed using a mixed methods approach. The quantitative results revealed that, generally, the conversations about relational conflict among the group of female friends were more comparable than disparate for Black and White women. Both the quantitative and qualitative results indicated that the type of support provided as well as identification to the group, in-group solidarity and derogation of the male partner were common for both groups of women. These effects were significantly associated with a decrease in perceived relational closeness with the male romantic partner. There was also a significant three-way interaction for male prototypicality, the ethnicity of the woman, and derogation of the male partner for relational closeness. For Black women who had lower to moderate levels of male prototypicality during their conversation about the conflict among their female friends, derogation of the male romantic partner was significantly associated with women feeling less close with their romantic partner. When male prototypicality was high, there was no significant association between derogation and perceived relational closeness. For White women who perceived the male partner to have any level of male prototypicality (high, moderate, or low), increased derogation was significantly associated with them feeling less close to their male romantic partner. The qualitative results also revealed a distinct difference in the way Black women and White women communicate their support. A thematic analysis of the open-end remarks revealed that White friends were much more likely than Black friends to express their dual concern for the female friend and the male romantic partner, providing a fair and balanced perspective of both sides. Unlike White women, Black women were more forthright in their opinions of the conflict, using strong derogatory language, and typically sided with the male partner or with the female friend but not both. Specifically, Black women used more direct messages to signal agreement with the female partner and proceeded to derogate the male partners' behavior. Or, on the contrary, they would signal agreement with the male partner and directly communicate to the female friend the error of her ways. This current study is the first to use a social identity perspective as the underlying theoretical framework for the social support process among friendship networks. It extends current research by testing for the harmful, rather than helpful, nature of social support networks across cultural groups.",,,
1368,"The ""Facade of Inclusivity"": Post-Conflict Democracy in Rwanda","This study attempts to examine the extent and limits of democracy following periods of intense conflict, as it asks the question: how much democracy is possible post-conflict? The genocide in Rwanda in 1994 left the international community watching for the emergence of a democracy in the fragile nation in the years following. Tackling these challenges required intense political commitment to the ideals of democracy, although this form of democracy came with certain limitations on ""rights"" and allowances, namely in terms of freedom of speech, that in turn inhibited various individuals, groups, and media outlets from having an active voice in the political process. These acknowledged trade-offs were initially enforced to inhibit residual tensions and bring about progress and country-wide rehabilitation and peace, but this same limited form of democracy is still present today, to the detriment of Rwanda's development. By looking at governmental power through the use of the courts, restrictive election procedures, and the further marginalization of Rwanda's Twa population, the current political situation in Rwanda shows how this same form of post-conflict democracy also has the potential to be wielded as a authoritarian political tool that imparts dangerous rights limitations and notions of second-class citizenship through policy, laws, and interactions with the international community. Rwanda's government has embarked on a campaign of repression and censorship of the population that prevents the expression of dissenting political opinions, uses fear to gain compliance, and prevents the recognition of unique concerns facing the indigenous communities along the borders. Unless the current administration is held accountable for addressing the numerous rights limitations inherent in Rwanda's current democracy, the danger of re-instating authoritarian rule is very real.",,,
1369,"Deflowering Attachments: Prostitutes, Popular Culture, and Affective Histories of Chineseness","Deflowering Attachments: Prostitutes, Popular Culture, and Affective Histories of Chineseness traces a transpacific history of the constant remaking of ""Chineseness"" through representations of the prostitute figure in popular media circulated among China, the United States, and the Sinophone communities of Hong Kong and Taiwan. From literature to film to new media, this dissertation historicizes how the prostitute figure---often portrayed as a ""desired other"" situated in-between the public and private---unsettles vying notions of community, nationhood, and globality. The project focuses on two historical junctures at which notions of ""China"" and ""Chineseness"" underwent massive re-configuration, and at which the prostitute figure was prevalent in popular culture: the making of the modern Chinese nation-state at the turn of the twentieth century, and during the Cold War-era. Defining ""Chineseness"" lies at the core of Chinese cultural studies, an academic field long haunted by debates over genetic and political authenticity. Given the emerging prominence of ""China"" in global media, the study of ""Chineseness"" has also gained significance in the context of global humanities. Previous scholarship has investigated ""Chineseness"" largely in terms of ideological or economic projects, and has focused mainly on Sinitic-language cultural production. To this, I contribute my study of ""Chineseness"" from a translingual and transpacific scope, and examine it as a consistently reinvented affective product: shared social sentiments that characterize particular historical moments. Reading the prostitute as an ""affective laborer"" that generates popular imaginaries, I examine the ways political and personal attachments create shifting boundaries of transnational ""Chinese"" worlds, and challenge modern historiography, which has long taken nation-based cultural logics as center.",,,
1370,Hearing Double: The Musical Body and the Female Voice in the Works of E.T.A. Hoffmann and George Sand,"With a focus on George Sand as a reader of E.T.A. Hoffmann, this dissertation offers a feminist reading of the figure of the musician and traces how Sand, through her continual engagement with Hoffmann's work over the course of her career, rewrites the narrative space of music from one of aesthetics to one of both aesthetics and of caring, ethical relations. While critics agree that Hoffmann's writing had a significant impact on Sand's fantastic and musical fiction, this study investigates the strategies via which Sand departs from Hoffmann's project. Over the course of her career, this departure, neither immediate nor easy, structures Sand's transformation of narratives that position the female singer as the composer's muse and as, what I am calling, his musical double. In addition to foregrounding the emergence of the female voice against the cult of the artist, Sand redirects her focus to folk music, from the art music central to Hoffmann's aesthetics, and privileges the social body, including the maternal, familial, and collective social bodies, over the individual artistic genius. As she demythologizes, re-historicizes, and re-embodies the female musical figure, Sand plays with the possibilities that visceral, personal and interpersonal responses to music offer for narratives of social relationships, and writes community formation, via musical scenes, as a function of the reciprocity of affective, artistic expression. Thus, while scholarship on nineteenth-century literature has often focused on the gaze, specifically a male gaze, I investigate here the role of the acoustic in literature and situate the acoustic as a generative medium of intersubjectivity and community.",,,
1371,Aspects of Three-dimensional Chern-Simons Superconformal Field Theories and their M-theory Interpretation,"In this thesis we study different aspects of three-dimensional superconformal Chern-Simons theories that are good candidates to be realized as worldvolume theories of M2-branes. We begin by studying the moduli space of vacua of abelian and non-abelian A-D-E orbifolds of the ABJM model and we find that in the dual M-theory setup, the M-theory fiber is divided by the product of the Chern-Simons level times the order of the orbifold group. We also see a direct relation in this setup between the Chern-Simons levels of the different groups and fluxes for fractional brane cycles. We further generalize this analysis to orbifolds with discrete torsion of the ABJM theory by a finite subgroup Gamma of SU(2) x SU(2). It is shown that, in general, the order m of the cocycle we chose to twist the algebra by, enters in a non-trivial way in the moduli space of vacua of the resulting theory. In order to compute more general moduli spaces a semiclassical method to analyze the spectrum of BPS monopole operators of N = 2 superconformal field theories in 3d is proposed. We show that the chiral ring of the theory results from the semiclassical holomorphic quantization of the solution of classical BPS equations of motion on the cylinder. We apply this formalism to various theories. We also use these techniques to compare the chiral rings of theories that might be related to each other via Seiberg dualities in four dimensions in the classical limit. We find that the change of basis transformations that generate dualities in four dimensions generically do not work in three dimensions in the presence of Chern-Simons terms. We also determine the spectrum of R-charges of the chiral ring operators by assembling them on a Hilbert series and by minimizing the coefficient of the maximum pole relative to the trial R-charge. This is related to volume minimization in theories with dual supergravity setups.",,,
1373,Computing prime factors using a Josephson phase-qubit architecture: 15 = 3 x 5,"Josephson phase-quantum-bits, (""qubits""), together with superconducting resonators, comprise the essential quantum elements in a state-of-the-art quantum processor (QuP). A QuP can be used to exploit quantum mechanics to find the prime factors of composite numbers by running Shor's algorithm[57]. In this thesis, I describe the first solid-state demonstration of a compiled version of Shor's algorithm. To meet this challenge, I designed a QuP so that I could map the problem of factoring the number N = 15 onto a quantum circuit that is compatible with our technological capabilities. The QuP is composed of nine quantum elements: four phase qubits and five superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators. Using this device, I ran a three-qubit complied version of Shor's algorithm and successfully found the prime factors 48% of the time (compared to the ideal success rate of 50 %). In addition, the QuP produced coherent interactions between five quantum elements, and bi- and tripartite entanglement, which was verified via quantum state tomography (QST). Scaling up to nine quantum elements and performing these experiments represent key milestones to realizing a quantum computer. Continued improvements in the superconducting qubit coherence times and more complex circuits should provide the resources necessary to factor larger composite numbers and run more intricate quantum algorithms in the near future.",,,
1374,Perception and Playthings: Optical Toys as Instruments of Science and Culture,"This dissertation studies optical toys such as the zoetrope, stereoscope, and related visual media, as elements of late nineteenth and early twentieth century children's culture, and explores their roles in perpetuating particular modes of visual and sensory engagement. Synthesizing work in the history of science and psychology, theories of childhood, and film and media historiography, the project challenges the assumption that optical toys were merely instrumental developments culminating in the invention of cinema and instead characterizes their use as a set of distinctive media practices responsible for cultivating new forms of spectatorship and interaction. Through an examination of the media artifacts and discourses in which they took part, the dissertation traces how optical entertainments transformed the demonstration of visual illusions from an amusing novelty to a basic perceptual competency by the end of the nineteenth century. Each of the four body chapters concentrates on the use of optical toys and related media within a particular context, including: optical devices in the early psychology laboratory, the stereoscope in American schools, persistence of vision toys in the home, and movable toy books as an extension of this new media culture. I argue that these optical devices are associated with specific sensory paradigms that characterize visual perception as deceptive and the eye as an organ that must be trained and brought into the realm of reason and efficiency. Optical toys thus trained children's patterns of perception and shaped their visual habits in ways that positioned the experience of visual entertainment as a form of consumption. Such an in-depth treatment of optical toys revises much existing film and media scholarship by foregrounding their role in reorganizing visual perception in developmental terms.",,,
1375,Exploiting Parametric Resonance and Amplification in Microcantilever-based Mass Sensing,"Sensors based on microcantilevers have been widely used for detecting and measuring various chemical and biological agents. Research in this area continues to grow and increasing focus is on improving their performance and applicability. Parametric resonance and amplification are two important dynamic phenomena that are finding increasing application in the field of microsensor technology. The work in this dissertation aims to exploit these dynamic effects in order to enhance the performance of and achieve new functionality in microcantilever-based mass sensors. The first part of this dissertation considers parametric amplification of a multidegree of freedom resonant mass sensing array. Applying parametric amplification increases the effective resonant quality factors of the array, which provides an effective means of improving device sensitivity. The second part of this dissertation examines mass sensing based on parametric resonance in the presence of detection noise. The advantage in counteracting the influence of detection noise is shown by comparing parametric to conventional linear mass sensing, in which the detection sensitivity does not deteriorate for the parametric case when a tenfold increase in detection noise is introduced. Furthermore, additional functionality of the parametric resonance based mass sensor is realized by utilizing it as a threshold detector. The final part of this dissertation focuses on the development of a new proof-of-concept parametrically-excited microcantilever mass sensor for explosives detection. The sensor is functionalized with a receptor material that allows for the selective identification of target analytes. The response of the sensor is shown to be fast and reversible with a potential detection limit in the sub-ppb range.",,,

The need for this study stems from the current state of scholarship on the subject and the methodologies employed. By compiling potential suicides indiscriminately or focusing exclusively on literary portrayals, scholars have advanced certain fundamental misconceptions that now dominate modern understandings of Roman suicide and its cultural significance. This project relies on the creation and analysis of what amounts to the first comprehensive compilation of historically attested suicides during the Republican period from 264--30 BCE. This catalogue differentiates itself from other collations through a grounding in empirical evidence, thoroughness in providing all relevant accounts, and consideration of context. This methodology has produced significant new findings. Contrary to recent theories, it becomes clear that Roman self-killing was not an expected response to shame or loss of honor due to conspicuous political or military failings. The evidence shows that suicide was much more often a personal decision reached through a rough pattern of weighing up costs and incentives based on circumstances rather than an act undertaken in accordance with societal norms. Research shows a close connection between the emergence of civil conflict and Roman suicide. Civil strife essentially alters the standard rules in armed conflict, impacting both the perspectives and the behavior of the participants. This proves a significant dynamic for Roman suicide: Romans had a noteworthy history of violent precedents leading to a reluctance of falling into the hands of domestic enemies, which in turn contributed greatly to increased suicide rates among aristocrats. This increase and Cato's landmark suicide caused suicide to acquire a prominent position in the communal discourse. As a result, the act began assuming a new cultural position by the Republic's final years. Suicide gained a greater capacity to be ennobling, symbolic, or to provide some commentary on an agent's character or cause. These conclusions reinforce a fundamental point that has been overlooked: Roman suicide had a traceable history and evolved over time.",,,
1378,A Theoretical Framework for Virtual-Worlds Research: Toward a Proxemics of Virtuality,"Virtual worlds, more properly called online worlds, offer a rich, new arena for the study of human activity. However, those who study online worlds struggle with the perception that they are not ""real"" places. This is completely untrue, and possible-worlds narrative theory provides a way to think about online worlds as real places. From this foundation, it is possible to create a theoretical framework for understanding how people interact with online spaces by examining these spaces from within their own context. This framework incorporates possible-worlds theory as well as two other analytical strands. Media-richness theory, from the field of communication studies, posits that people choose more or less ""rich"" communication channels based upon the ambiguity or complexity of the message and situation. This way of thinking can be extended to spaces as well, as ""richness"" can be defined in terms of a space's design and decor. Once a space's richness is determined, we turn to semiotic theory to understand more deeply the symbolic importance of the elements that comprise that richness. The completed analytical framework is brought to bear on a variety spaces within the online world of Second Life. Through ethnographic participant observation, information on how users interacted with each space was collected and the results examined with the new theoretical approach. The spaces examined included artistic, educational, and entertainment venues, both formal and informal. These case studies provide practical examples of the application of the analytical framework to online spaces. Finally, another application of this approach is demonstrated with literary analysis. The possible-worlds approach means that the world of any given story can be taken as the context for an examination of the spaces encountered within it. From there, the same methodology that was used with online space can be used with the literary space. Examples from novels, film, and television demonstrate the analytical power of this theoretical approach, and leave the possibility for its application in many other fields as well.",,,
1379,The Theory of Altered Disclosures: Testing the Influence of Hormonal Responses on Individuals' Disclosure Decision Processes,"This dissertation proposes and tests a new communication theory, the theory of altered disclosures, and addresses the underlying assumption in much of the communication literature that when individuals choose to disclose information, they are doing so logically and rationally. The theory instead argues that there are times when individuals experience altered states that likely influence their communication behaviors. Specifically, resource management issues, substance-induced responses, and hormonal responses should predict altered cognitive states. These states likely influence risk-benefit assessments, such that individuals assess greater benefits and fewer risks to disclosing than they would if they were not experiencing an altered state. The altered risk-benefit assessment should also mediate the relationship between altered states and three dimensions of altered disclosures---intentionality, magnitude, and amount. The present study tested the domain of hormonal responses in the context of sexual activity and several of the predictions presented in the theory were supported. Additionally, a fourth dimension (i.e., valence) of altered disclosures was tested in this context. The results revealed that the altered state of orgasm predicted increased benefit assessments. These benefit assessments also mediated the relationship between the altered state and two of the four dimensions of altered disclosures---magnitude and valence. However, orgasm did not predict risk assessments or the dimensions of unintentionality or amount. Additional analyses tested the influence of testosterone, oxytocin receptor polymorphisms, relationship status, and alcohol consumption on these processes. Testosterone was a significant predictor of altered disclosures. The higher individuals' testosterone levels, the fewer benefits and greater risks they assessed to disclosing after sexual activity, and the less positively valenced was the information they disclosed (though the dimensions of unintentionality, amount, and magnitude were not significant). Additionally, the relationship between testosterone and valence was mediated by risk-benefit assessments. However, individuals' oxytocin receptor polymorphism genotypes were not significant predictors of risk-benefit assessments or the dimensions of altered disclosures in the context of sexual activity. Relationship status also significantly predicted increased benefit assessments and decreased risk assessments. This association was also moderated by trust, but only for benefit assessments. As trust increased for individuals in committed relationships, their perceptions of the benefits of disclosing also increased. Individuals in more committed relationships disclosed information of greater magnitude and more positively valenced information after sexual activity compared to individuals in less committed relationships, though the dimensions of unintentionality and amount were not significant. Risk-benefit assessments also mediated the relationship with valence, but only benefit assessments (not risk assessments) mediated the relationship with magnitude. Individuals in more committed relationships also reported fewer feelings of regret and more relationship satisfaction after their disclosures than individuals in more casual relationships. Finally, alcohol consumption predicted individuals' benefit assessments, the magnitude of their disclosures, and the valence of their disclosures, but not in the hypothesized directions. The more alcohol individuals consumed, the fewer benefits they assessed to disclosing and the less deep and positively valenced were their disclosures. However, alcohol consumption did predict the unintentionality of individuals' disclosures in the hypothesized direction. The more alcohol individuals consumed, the more unintentional they were in their disclosures. Together, the results suggest that benefit assessments, rather than risk assessments, are influenced by altered states. Additionally, magnitude and valence appear to be the two primary dimensions influenced by altered states in the context of sexual activity. Overall, this project contributes to the study of interpersonal communication by advancing a new theory of disclosure---a theory that examines the conditions, including hormone-induced states, that influence altered disclosures and the consequences of these disclosures.",,,
1381,The Relationship Between College Student Success and Well Being Determinants: An exploratory study of measures,"This study, using responses from 1,040 students, explored predictive relationships between well-being variables (self-efficacy, optimism, hope, gratitude and grit) and intention to persist as an undergraduate. The combination of hope and gratitude significantly predicted variance in student persistence, suggesting further exploration of these measures for intervention and prevention of student attrition. This study is considered a pilot for a future longitudinal study of college student well-being and protective factors. The intended audience is college leaders interested in higher inference measures of student persistence.",,,
1382,Nanofluidic Energy Conversion Using pnc-Silicon Membranes,"The need for alternative energy sources is a very real problem in the world today. New approaches using nano-scale technology has become a topic of interest and promises great potential in solving the energy problem. First in this thesis, we explore the history behind the development of nanofluidic-based electrokinetic energy conversion and compare it to other small-scale energy conversion technologies. Next, a theoretical and experimental study of nanofluidic conversion efficiencies are presented; showing the progression of the field towards a usable and practical solution. We derive a theoretical model of cylindrical pores for nanofluidic energy conversion and compare this to experimental data using pnc-Si membranes. Specifically, I derive fluid flow in a nanochannel using cylindrical coordinates coupled to the classic combination of the Navier-Stokes equation and the Poisson Boltzmann equation which contains the electrical body force term. We use a monovalent symmetric electrolyte, the Debye-Huckel approximation and the small angle approximation to derive streaming current, streaming potential, and efficiency. This model will serve as the basis to design and guide our experimental results. Next, a detailed study is presented on the development of the experimental set-up; including design iterations and the experimental procedure using the final design. In the final design, pnc-Si Membranes are used as the substrate of interest. This membrane offers regularly formed 50 nm sized pores with a thickness of 30 nm and offers low flow impedance due to its small thickness and regular geometry. Multiple pores give a proportionally increased power output compared to a single channel. We drive 1 mM--100 mM concentration KCl electrolyte solutions through pnc-Si membranes by applied mechanical pressures, the output of electrical currents were measured and recorded. We obtained currents in the nano-amp range and compared our experimental results to those derived theoretically. Discrepancies between the two can be explained by concentration polarization due to ion/charge built-up on the pnc-Si membrane, polarization of the material itself, and high zeta potentials originally not accounted for in the theoretical model.",,,
1383,Ruling in Ancient Greece and India: A Historical-Comparative Approach to Political Philosophy,"This dissertation establishes a new analytic approach to understanding fundamental political ideas of other cultures and time periods and applies it to a study of ancient Greek and Indian conceptions of ruling. What I call a historical-comparative approach builds on continuing debates over how best to develop a cross-cultural perspective in political philosophy. Accordingly, I show how this approach enhances analytic rigor for both the history of political ideas and normative political philosophy while preventing culturally reductionist comparisons. Examining ancient Greek and Indian political thought ca. 1500--650 BCE provides an important test of this approach because ruling questions were central to both Greek and Indian cultures. This study focuses on Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Hesiod's Theogony and Works and Days, and the Vedic Sam&dotbelow;hit as and Brahman&dotbelow;as. Ruling proves to be the most important political concept in each tradition, although each one develops a very different understanding of what it means to rule. I elucidate the earliest tradition of Indian political thought as one of stewardship and the Greek tradition as one of distinction. Using the Indian tradition as a cross-cultural vantage point provides critical leverage to better understand the emergence of self-possessed individuality in the Western tradition, further uncovering the earliest move towards a democratic way of thinking. Finally, I make a critical-normative move and draw upon the Indian understanding to challenge ancient and contemporary Western beliefs about ruling. I then formulate an alternative understanding of ruling predicated on an outwardly porous, polycentric conception of individuality that addresses contemporary issues of human-centrism, individualism, and communal interconnectedness.",,,
1384,"The Effects of Taxotere and Ixabepilone on Mitotic Arrest, Apoptosis, Inhibition of Proliferation and Inhibition of Microtubule Dynamic Instability in Class III beta-tubulin Knockdown MCF7 Cells","One of the major barriers to successful chemotherapy is development of resistance. A significant amount of fundamental and clinical data has been amassed suggesting that one of the major causes for resistance to taxanes is overexpression of the class III beta-tubulin (betaIII-tubulin) isotype. Correlation between betaIII-tubulin overexpression and taxane resistant tumors has been observed in several types of malignancies; breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer [1]. Therefore, it is crucial to further investigate the possible role of betaIII-tubulin in tumor resistance. Understanding its role will help us in future drug research and drug design, as well as patient treatment. To determine what role betaIII-tubulin plays in response to taxotere or ixabepilone treatment, I used MCF7 stably expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein-alpha-tubulin cells to study the effects of taxotere or ixabepilone after small interfering RNA mediated knockdown of betaIII-tubulin. I report suppressive effects of taxotere and ixabepilone in live interphase cells on microtubule dynamic instability. Taxotere suppressed the growth rate of microtubules in cells expressing reduced amounts of betaIII-tubulin with lower potency than it suppressed growth rate of microtubules in control siRNA-transfected (control transfected) cells. Ixabepilone on the other hand suppressed the shortening rate, rescue distance and dynamicity of microtubules more strongly in cells expressing reduced amounts of betaIII-tubulin than in control transfected cells. We also found a weaker mitotic arrest by taxotere and ixabepilone in betaIII-tubulin knockdown cells compared to control transfected cells, but in a cell proliferation assay there was no difference in IC50 values for taxotere or ixabepilone between control transfected and betaIII-tubulin knockdown cells. These results show that betaIII-tubulin knockdown may reduce suppression of microtubule dynamic instability by taxotere and enhances the effects of ixabepilone on suppression of microtubule dynamic instability; but in prolonged drug incubation, knockdown of betaIII-tubulin has no effect on taxotere or ixabepilone sensitivity.",,,
1385,Functional Analyses of the RNA-dependent Protein Kinase PKR and the Z-DNA Binding Orthologue PKZ in Mammalian Cells,"The interferon-inducible, RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR is an important effector of antiviral and antiproliferative activities of interferons. Although the best characterized function of PKR is the inhibition of translation, more recently PKR also has been shown to modulate signal transduction processes and regulate gene expression. Upon RNA binding, PKR is autophosphorylated and then subsequently catalyzes the phosphorylation of protein synthesis initiation factor eIF2alpha, the best known cellular substrate of PKR. Here we analyzed the function of PKR in translational control as well as in activation of IFN-beta gene expression in response to measles virus infection. A complementation assay strategy was carried out by expressing PKR in PKR-deficient (PKR kd) human cells stably knocked down for PKR protein expression by a shRNA silencing approach. As a comparative analysis, the function of the Z-DNA binding protein PKZ, which has a kinase domain similar to that of PKR, was also assessed by PKZ expression in human PKRkd cells. We first demonstrated that in the complemented PKRkd cells in the absence of infection, PKR as well as PKZ both mediated the inhibition of cap-dependent translation in a manner that depended upon catalytic activity. In contrast, IRES-dependent translation was not affected. While PKR-mediated inhibition of reporter expression was correlated with an elevated level of eIF2alpha phosphorylation at serine 51, no detectable increase in phosphorylated eIF2alpha was observed in PKZ expressing cells. Furthermore, C-deficient (Cko) measles virus infection of complemented PKRkd cells revealed that both RNA-binding and catalytic activities of PKR are required for PKR-dependent activation of the IFN-beta signaling pathway and induction of IFN-beta gene. Neither a catalytic mutant form of PKR (K296R), nor the related kinase PKZ were able to mediate activation of ATF2, JNK and p38, or enhance the induction of IFN-beta gene; and only wildtype PKR but not the K296R or PKZ reduced the growth of Cko virus in PKRkd cells. In addition, PKR enhanced the IFN-beta transcript levels through translational control by phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2alpha. The expression of a phosphorylation defective form of eIF2alpha (S48,51A) in PKR-sufficient cells reduced the induction of IFN-beta and enhanced the production of IkappaB-alpha, the inhibitor of the IFN-beta transcription factor, NF-kappaB, following Cko virus infection. In conclusion, these studies reveal the importance of translational control function of PKR through phosphorylation of eIF2alpha in suppression of gene expression and induction of IFN gene following virus infection or aberrant RNA generation during transfection.",,,
1386,"Dead-Tree Data: Print Novels, Information Storage, and Media Transition, 1910/2010","This dissertation examines the impact that the culture of information storage has had on the development of the novel. Drawing parallels between the current moment of media transition (circa 2010) and the early years of the twentieth century (circa 1910), I argue that British, American, and Irish writers in both periods have responded to the marginalization of the book as a storage format by producing experimental novels that explore the aesthetic potential of the print book. In doing so, these writers examine the status of the print novel as an information storage medium, considering how the tactile materiality and limited storage capacity of the book both complement and complicate the archival work of narrative representation. My project locates experimental novels within wider media ecologies by pairing close readings of literary texts with case studies of developments within information culture (such as the invention of portable microfilm readers, attempts to visualize the Internet, and the use of index cards in archival management). The first half of the dissertation focuses on the issue of scale in information storage circa 1910 and 2010, and the second half addresses the role of materiality and tactility in information storage and narrative representation during these periods. By tracing the intertwined genealogies of contemporary literature and digital information culture back to the early twentieth century, my research establishes a tradition of media-aware experimentation in the novel and deepens the theorization of information storage as a central issue for media studies.",,,
1387,Understanding the Semantics of Networked Text,"Social networks are a powerful means for information sharing. A large social network typically has hundreds of millions of users. These users are interconnected through social links to friends, colleagues, family members, etc. The frequent interaction and information exchange between users form a massive heterogeneous information network. Understanding the semantic information in the textual data and the topological information in the social network poses a grant challenge for data mining researchers. This Ph.D. dissertation tackles the problem of understanding the unstructured or semi-structured data in social networks. First, we describe a parallel spectral clustering algorithm that makes possible clustering analysis on large-scale social networks with hundreds of millions of users. Comprehensive analysis, extraction and integration of information from multiple sources are necessary. Next, we describe an information extraction engine that extracts data items from Web pages without knowing the data wrapping template. We also present an information integration approach to aggregate data tables collected from the Web and hence better serve general Web search. To make information routing in collaborative networks more efficient, we describe generative models to characterize expertise awareness relationships between agents in collaborative networks and provide efficient task routing recommendations. We also describe, in depth, the first quantitative analysis of the information flow efficiency in collaborative networks. To utilize the accumulated information, we developed a topic modeling approach that allows document retrieval across multiple document sets with possible semantic gaps and vocabulary gaps.",,,
1388,A Study of the Interaction of the Microprosodic Effects of Prevocalic Consonants and Tone in Navajo,"The microprosodic effects of adjacent consonants on the fundamental frequency (F0) of vowels are well-studied. The microprosodic effects of postvocalic glottal consonants have been implicated in tonogenesis in Vietnamese by Haudricourt (as cited in Hombert et al. 1979), in Burmese by Maran (as cited in Hombert et al. 1970), and in Middle Chinese (Mei 1970). This study examines the relationship between tone and prevocalic consonants in Navajo, a language with two level tones. Specifically, the question of whether the magnitude of microprosodic effects is affected by the presence of phonemic tone on vowels is addressed. The data used were selected words in the recording of Speaking Navajo: An Intermediate Text. Fundamental frequencies were automatically calculated using Praat, and statistical analysis was conducted in R.",,,
1389,Physical Modeling and RLCG Extraction of Interconnects in 3-D ICs alongside Interconnect Technology Exploration with Carbon Nanomaterials,"As VLSI technologies evolve in More-Moore (smaller feature size via scaling) and More-than-Moore (more functionality via 3-D integration) eras and become increasingly communication centric, interconnects become central to improving the performance and energy-efficiency of VLSI circuits. This dissertation identifies and addresses some of the key technical problems of emerging interconnect structures and materials applicable to both 3-D integrated circuits (3-D ICs) as well as ultra-scaled planar ICs. In the rapidly growing platform of 3-D ICs, we develop physical models and investigate the extraction of both the parallel admittance (capacitance (C) and conductance (G)) and the series impedance (resistance (R) and inductance (L)) of conventional and new interconnect structures, under a wide range of frequencies (few MHz to 100GHz). We derive both 2D (per-unit-length) analytical CG model and 3D CG extraction methodologies (showing 103 times speed-up against HFSS at similar accuracy level) of Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs), with consideration of MOS effect and ac conduction in silicon. We also obtain a compact capacitance model of Through-Oxide Vias (TOVs) in SOI based 3-D ICs. We then extend our work to investigate the CG/capacitive coupling from TSVs/TOVs to the active regions and provide design guidelines to alleviate noise in active devices. We obtain a fast 2D and 3D RL extraction method for the horizontal interconnects sandwiched between conductive substrates (our 3D RL extraction method shows 18-25X speed-up against HFSS at similar accuracy level), as well as 2D and 3D analytical RL model (<7% error against HFSS) for TSVs, with consideration of skin effect and substrate eddy current effect. All the models and extraction methods are verified against rigorous electromagnetic field solvers. In the domain of emerging interconnect materials, electrical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are investigated. Using Landauer's theory, a conductance model of multi-layer GNRs is derived for predictive analyses. We also extend our TSV RL model for the case of CNT bundles, in which we demonstrate a reduced skin effect. Subsequently, we study the circuit electrical performance of TSVs and horizontal interconnects with different interconnect materials (including Cu, W, CNT and GNR). From these comparative analyses, we illustrate the conditions necessary for making CNTs and GNRs viable alternatives to Cu or W (closely packed SWCNT bundle and multi-layer intercalation doped zz-GNR with smooth edges). Besides the electrical performance, we also study the thermal performance of interconnects using the thermal-electro analogies. We develop an efficient large scale thermal extraction tool based on an existing electrical resistance extraction tool. We also develop an empirical interconnect thermal model and anisotropic equivalent medium approach based on an existing interconnect capacitance model. We then apply the anisotropic equivalent medium approach in 3-D IC heat dissipation analysis, and demonstrate potential benefits of CNT bundle based TSVs in terms of heat dissipation.",,,
1390,Placing the American Death Penalty in the Global Context: A Test of the Marshall Hypothesis,"One of the pillars in the modern case against capital punishment is the international argument which contends that the abolition of the American death penalty is supported by viewing the practice in the global context. America's legacy of racism, societal demand for tough-on-crime approaches, and political maneuvering around the death penalty have resulted in the United States being one of the only free and democratic countries in the world to practice capital punishment. America's unusual position on this issue cannot be fully understood or challenged without being viewed from an international perspective. The international argument has also become much more popular in recent years, but despite its increase in significance the actual effect this argument on American public opinion has gone virtually untested. The Marshall Hypothesis (that knowledge about the death penalty will reduce support for it) has been measured in terms of the public's receptivity to other important arguments for abolition including racial discrimination, deterrence, and innocence. Each of these arguments and a brief history of the U.S. death penalty debate are described in early chapters in order to provide background for the original research presented in the second half of the thesis. This study adds to the body of research known as ""Testing the Marshall Hypothesis"" by empirically measuring the impact the international argument has on the opinion of adult American students at a public university in California. Using survey data from over 200 students, this research provides data regarding three questions: (1) is student support for capital punishment affected by exposure to international information regarding the death penalty? If so, (2) to what degree is their support affected, and (3) what pieces of information are most or least compelling? The results of the study lend support to the hypotheses that American university students are receptive to the international argument against capital punishment, that the international argument can alter the opinions of American students to varying and sometimes substantial degrees, and that certain facts are more compelling than others in this regard. The quantitative evidence presented in this study supports Justice Marshall's hypothesis and further strengthens the possibility that the international argument could be a notable contributor in shaping public opinion regarding the death penalty in America.",,,
1391,Religious Silence in Japanese American Arts,"Theories of silence tend to depict silence as the opposite of sound, speech, or presence. In this limited depiction, it is the binary opposite indicating absence, and theorists have used this understanding of silence to illustrate musical rests, political oppression, and divine mystery. However, Japanese Americans employ silences in their arts in order to resist oppression and to pass on religious ideas and practices. Since Japanese Americans use multiple kinds of silence, this dissertation offers a theory of ""non-binary silence"" that explains how a single silence can accomplish multiple functions. The dissertation explores the multiple layers of silence in Japanese American history and in several Japanese American arts, including farming, gardening, hip hop, jazz, monuments, origami, rhetoric, sculpture, and comedy. This exploration reveals that Japanese Americans have maintained some persecuted and marginalized religious ideas and practices by transforming them into artistic silences. This process of gaimenteki, which means outward assimilation, is a tactic for spiritual survival that was developed to resist the oppression of Buddhism, Christianity, Shinto, and indigenous religions in Japan and in the United States. For example, during the World War II internment camps several Japanese American religions were categorized as dangerous, yet Japanese Americans communicated their religious ideas and practices through gardening and jazz music, which were considered innocuous and American. In such ways, Japanese Americans have responded to political and racist silencing with artistic silences that simultaneously preserve religion. This dissertation examines these religious silences through ethnographic and historical work. Case studies of Japanese American artists will be used to demonstrate how Japanese Americans have used religious silences to preserve ideas from Buddhism, Confucianism, and indigenous religions by transforming them to appear to match the racial, imperial, national, and colonial projects of Japan and the United States. The religious silences contain Japanese American conceptions of kami (Shinto deities), mediumship, Confucian attunement, the ethical treatment of life, an independent and interconnected self, sorrowful joy, and justice.",,,
1392,"Heterogeneous ""Click"" Dendrimer Architectures as Functional Polymer Scaffolds and Simulations Investigating Polymer-Dendrimer Unimolecular Micelles","Dendrimers are structurally complex, regularly branching polymers whose physical properties are dominated by their high functional group density. Since their inception in the 1980's new synthetic strategies have arose with the desire for increasing the chemical complexity of the interior and exterior. Accelerated growth of larger generations with fewer synthetic steps, simplification of purification, and new methods for end-group functionalization have drawn much interest in the dendrimer field as well as providing potential for their use in a variety of materials applications. Herein, methodologies for forming a library of complex dendrimer architectures are described in order for a better understanding of the possible structure property landscape, which is added to by both physical experimentation and computational simulation. The physical goal was to design and synthesize two isomeric dendrimer architectures using the AB2 type polyester branching unit, 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid (bisMPA). The two architectures were synthesized modularly using a hybrid growth approach involving the divergent synthesis of dendrons and coupling of their core functionalities with the copper(I) catalyzed Azide-Alkyne Cycloaddition (CuAAC). Two ""Click""-type reactive moieties, based upon CuAAC and radical Thiol-Ene coupling reactions, were attached to the termini of dendrimers. By attaching the two highly efficient reactive groups, either homogenously on the dendrimer periphery or isolated to individual dendrons, we have developed a small library of functional scaffolds capable of being used to produce a vast array of macromolecules with various properties. The computational goal was to understand the differences associated with the two dendrimer architectures when linear polymer chains were attached to the dendrimer periphery. Simulations using coarse-grained Brownian Dynamics methods were studied with varied generation size of the dendrimers, and thus functional group number on the periphery. The molecular architecture, polymer chain length, and differences in chemical potentials between the polymer chains could be varied to yield information on the unimolecular structure of these macromolecules in a dilute solution.",,,
1393,Modular Approaches to New Functional Materials,"There is a constant demand for materials with new or improved properties. Ideal syntheses of new materials will allow rapid preparation of libraries of materials whose properties can be tuned to match those required for a given application. Here we present three such syntheses. A ""Click"" based approach to new N-vinyl monomers provides a family of monomers with various properties reminiscent of vinylpyridines (polarity, ion and hydrogen bonding), styrene (thermal stability, aromatic core), acrylates (modularity, functionality), and reactivity similar to other N-vinyl monomers such as vinylimidazole. The polymerization of these monomers can be controlled my RAFT/MADIX or NMP to give random or block copolymers with properties distinct from the isomeric poly(C-vinyl triazoles). Another highly efficient reaction, the dimerization of ketenes, is used to prepare a series of rigid cyclobutanediol monomers. The multifaceted reactivity of Meldrum's acid is used to access a structurally diverse range of ketenes and resulting monomers. New polyesters based on these monomers provide improved stability over the structurally similar commercial monomer tetramethylcyclobutanediol. These new monomers should allow preparation of copolyesters capable of replacing bisphenol A-based polycarbonate in a number of applications, specifically related to the food industry, as the BPA monomer has been demonstrated to be a health hazard. Finally, an improved synthetic route to the conjugated building block dithienothiophene is described. This electron rich moiety can be copolymerized with a series of less electron rich monomers to provide conjugated polymers with distinct and unique optoelectronic properties. We demonstrate the importance of introducing a pi-conjugated linker to alleviate steric issues which can kink the polymer backbone and disrupt conjugation.",,,
1394,The Evolution of Pollen Performance and Mating System in the Annual Wildflower Genus Clarkia,"The shift from outcrossing to self-fertilization is a commonly observed evolutionary transition in angiosperms. While extensive research has examined the evolutionary associations between selfing and other plant traits, very few studies have investigated how mating systems influence sexual selection on pollen performance. In this dissertation, I evaluated previously unstudied aspects of mating system evolution and sexual selection in two pairs of Clarkia sister taxa with contrasting mating systems: the outcrosser, C. unguiculata and its selfing sister species, C. exilis, as well as C. xantiana ssp. xantiana and its selfing counterpart, C. x. parviflora. To test the prediction that, due to comparatively strong intrasexual competition for access to ovules, outcrossing taxa should evolve to produce faster growing pollen than their selfing relatives, I assessed pollen competition in natural populations of C. unguiculata and C. x. xantiana and evaluated pollen performance in natural populations of all four focal taxa. I evaluated pollen competition by measuring pollen limitation in multiple populations of C. unguiculata and C. x. xantiana in 2008-2010. Pollen limitation was consistently absent in C. unguiculata populations, but reproduction in C. x. xantiana populations was pollen-limited in two of the three years of the study. This suggests that pollen competition may be strong in C. unguiculata populations, but weak in C. x. xantiana. In 2008, I compared pollen germination and pollen tube growth rates between sister taxa following one-donor crosses. Clarkia unguiculata exhibited faster pollen germination than C. exilis. By contrast, C. x. parviflora, a selfing taxon that exhibits rapid floral development rates, demonstrated faster pollen tube growth than C. x. xantiana. I next examined the relationships between pollen performance and physiological performance within each taxon. In C. x. parviflora, an individual's mean pollen tube growth rate was positively correlated with its photosynthetic rate. In general, however, physiological performance was not associated with pollen performance. Finally, I used allozyme markers to generate outcrossing estimates for one population of each focal taxon and provide evidence that sister taxa differ in mating system. Collectively, the studies presented here further our understanding of mating system evolution and sexual selection in flowering plants.",,,
1395,Blood Trumps Principle: Problematic Academic and Media Discourses on Libya,"This thesis examines recent academic literature about Libya and media reports on the 2011 Libyan revolution to uncover the ways in which reductionist, stereotypical, and Orientalizing language is prevalent in the construction of Western knowledge about Libya. I borrow post-structural discourse analysis' method of looking at language to illustrate how recent academic and media discourses about Libya open up and close down particular Libyan identities, both by linking certain negative characteristics (uncivilized, undemocratic, violent, pre-modern, homogenous) together and by differentiating those characteristics against a preferred, Westernized identity (democratic, liberal, civilized, modern, rational). I examine these discourses through the lens of Orientalism, arguing that contemporary media has been guilty of using language that positions Libyan tribes as backwards and pre-modern. Media and academic discourses on Libya parallel each other in significant and troubling ways. In some cases, this was the result of the direct participation of academic Libya 'experts' in the media analysis of the revolution, in many other cases Orientalizing language and stereotypical assumptions came from media outlets themselves. These parallels and the enduring prevalence of certain stereotypes indicate that homogenizing and inaccurate language concerning Libya is, in many cases, a systemic problem. In media discourse especially, this language suggests not only an unwillingness to add clarifying qualifiers to unconfirmed or unconfirmable 'facts,' but also an urge to simplify complex narratives and social realities for a American or Western audience. I argue that a deeper understanding of Libyan history and culture, and a dramatic shift away from polarizing language are absolutely critical to the reworking of 'truths' about Libya and Libyan tribes. In concluding, this thesis calls for a new language concerning tribal peoples, the incorporation of both Libyan scholars and indigenous voices into academic discourses, and a move towards Libya scholarship that is not as tied to Western geo-political interests as the scholarship outlined in this thesis proves to be.",,,
1396,Generalized Deformations and Viscous Dissipation in Lipid Bilayers,"Though membranes have been studied on micron length scales for some time, much less is known about their behavior within the mesoscopic regime of 1-100 nanometers, which is arguably the most biologically important. My work focuses on the development of theories that bridge these length scales. The research has two main thrusts: I) modeling the effects of viscous dissipation observed in scattering experiments II) describing general types of elastic deformations. I) Using a previously established hydrodynamic theory, I demonstrated that viscous dissipation within lipid bilayers must be taken into account when analyzing data from neutron spin echo (NSE) spectroscopy measurements. The effects of dissipation were determined across multiple length scales by means of a numerical procedure. II) I developed a unified model for membrane elasticity that accounts for the effects of bending, compression, molecular orientation, and microscopic noise. By employing a geometric formalism, the theory even allows for a variable number of lipid molecules. The predictions of the model were found to be in excellent agreement with molecular simulations.",,,
1397,A Call to Sexual Arms: A Biographical Context to a Dramatic and Vocal Interpretation of the Songs of Benjamin Britten and W.H. Auden,"This paper explores the performer's vocal and dramatic interpretation of On this Island and Fish in the Unruffled Lakes based on the biographical context of composer Benjamin Britten, and poet W.H. Auden. I argue that these songs are written as a dialogue between Britten and Auden about the exploration of sexual identity and artistic maturation, and that this information is vital for the performer to give a proper interpretation. Both homosexual, Britten and Auden were writing these 1930s songs at a time when homosexuality was illegal in Great Britain. The personal and political anxieties of living a homosexual life are present in the songs, and a storyline of the internal processes of the artists is at hand. The storyline provides a wealth of information for the performer to make choices about vocal coloring, theatrical irony, and dramatic intent. I will demonstrate that these twelve songs are connected through music, text, and biographical context; and that it is imperative that the singer be cognizant of these connections to deliver a proper interpretation.",,,
1398,Organic Solar Cells: Understanding the Miscibility and Diffusion within Polymer-Fullerene Bulk Heterojunctions,"One of society's challenges is to develop a clean, renewable, and sustainable energy source. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) offer great potential as a low-cost solution to this need because of their ability to be solution processed over large areas. Currently, OPVs has surpassed the estimated 10% power conversion efficiency needed to achieve economic viability, but further improvement and large-area utilization is predicated on a deeper understanding of their complex microstructure and how this affects the device performance. This aim of this dissertation is to develop a deeper understanding of the temperature dependent miscibility and interdiffusion within polymer-fullerene based organic solar cells. This initial understanding was extended to include strategies to control the polymer-fullerene miscibility within OPVs and the effect on the OPV performance. Ultimately, the polymer-fullerene miscibility can be used to control the microstructure and power conversion efficiency of the polymer-fullerene BHJ OPVs.",,,
1399,"Forms and Platforms: Media, Emergence, and the Contemporary Mind","Each of this dissertation's three parts discusses media use at a different level of structure and process. Together, the parts articulate a new theory of user-media interaction. Part I emphasizes the importance of a dynamics-oriented approach to emergence, showing how semi-stable arrangements of matter and energy can interact in ways that make higher-level processes possible. It builds accounts of the functioning of bodies and minds ""from the bottom up,"" or from physical materials upward to mental phenomena, and of media technologies ""from the top down."" In so doing, it synthesizes and draws contrasts between numerous contemporary theories of the mind and theories of media. Part II discusses bodily interaction with media technologies, engaging with a lineage of thought that extends from pragmatic philosophy through contemporary embodied and extended theories of consciousness and cognition. It asserts the relevance of John Dewey's aesthetic philosophy to contemporary media theory and shows how extended cognition provides a valuable tool for understanding user-media interactions. It identifies in early film theory---particularly in the work of Hugo Munsterberg---cinema-specific accounts of perception that anticipate what later came to be called extended cognition. Parts II and III illustrate how media are capable of participating in phenomena such as perception, cognition, and memory. Through discussion of films such as What Time is it There? (Tsai Ming-liang, 2001) and videogames including Don't Look Back (Terry Cavanagh, 2009) and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (Rockstar Games, 2004), these parts contend that meaning occurs neither in the media text itself nor in the brain of the user, but rather in the interactions between users and media. This dissertation ultimately asserts that media go beyond shaping or influencing mental activity---rather, they play constitutive roles in it. This claim prompts a reconsideration of the roles that the humanities can play in interdisciplinary research, as well as a call for an increased emphasis on what hermeneutic scholarship offers the study of the mind.",,,
1400,"Religion Is What Individuals and Societies Make of It: Moderators of Religion's Effects at the Level of Person, Situation, and Culture","Although religion can be found in some form across every human culture, the way it impacts people's thoughts and behaviors may vary in systematic and important ways. In three sets of studies, I examine how religion's effects on psychology may vary according to key moderators at the broader level of culture or the situation and at the more specific level of the individual. First, in Studies 1--3, I demonstrate that religious values and the way people use religion to cope with difficulties may vary depending on the larger cultural context. Next, Studies 4--7 show that religious practices or thoughts may be linked to more conservative political beliefs, but largely for those who are powerful rather than powerless. Finally, in Study 8 I show that the effect of religious thoughts on prosocial behavior may be moderated by a genetic predisposition to environmental sensitivity. Using multiple methods, including content analysis, daily diary, priming techniques, and worldwide surveys, as well as diverse perspectives, such as cultural and social psychology and genetics, I first aim to examine how religion's influence can be moderated by culture, power, and genes. Second, I provide a working theoretical framework for understanding past research on religion and building new investigations on the topic, and in so doing, I hope to demonstrate that religion can be conceptualized in multiple ways and should thus be studied from different perspectives. Finally, I discuss implications for both the benefits and detriments of religion---a phenomenon that ultimately transpires in the context of a society and in the minds of individuals.",,,
1401,Understanding Diversity: From Representations to Perceptions,"The present research aimed to determine how people define and perceive diversity in historically majority-group dominated contexts. I hypothesized that diversity conveys both the numeric representation of racial minorities and the social acceptance of racial minorities, and that these two themes would serve as the basis for individuals' perceptions of groups' diversity. I also investigated whether the concept of fairness was relevant to mental representations and perceptions of diversity. In Study 1, I found that businesses professing commitment to diversity defined it primarily in terms of social acceptance. Fairness and numeric representation of minorities were secondary themes in businesses' diversity statements. In Study 2, I found that individuals defined diversity primarily in terms of numeric representation of racial minorities and secondarily in terms of social acceptance of minorities, but not in terms of fairness. In Study 3, I investigated whether cues to numeric representation and social acceptance levels of a group were used in perceptions of diversity. I found that college undergraduates' perceptions of diversity were driven by both cues to representation and to social acceptance. In addition, White students were more likely to base perceptions of diversity on a cue to representation whereas Latino students were more likely to base their perceptions of diversity in a cue to social acceptance. Finally, in Study 4, I demonstrated that numeric representation and social acceptance causally led to perceived diversity. However, social acceptance only influenced perceptions of diversity when numeric representation was high. Across the four studies, I showed that social acceptance and numeric representation are both important components of diversity and serve as the basis for perceiving diversity in groups.",,,
1402,The Communicative Construction of Safety in Wildland Firefighting,"This mixed methods dissertation examined the communicative construction of safety in wildland firefighting. I used a two-study mixed methods approach, examining the communicative accomplishment of safety from two perspectives: high reliability organizing (Weick, Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld, 1999), and safety climate (Zohar, 1980). In Study One, 27 firefighters from two functionally similar wildland firefighting crews were interviewed about their crew-level interactions involved in implementing safety rules and firefighting tasks. These critical incident narratives (Flanagan, 1954; Gremler, 2004) were compared to extract workgroup level differences in interaction patterns relating to local routines and application of safety rules for managing tasks and space. Findings revealed that the two crews differed substantially in their communicative interactions related to three specific routines: planning, use of safety rules, and authority. The crews also differed in their general interactions with one another related to safety, groupness, and efficiency. For Study Two, a survey assessing workgroup-level safety climate was completed by 379 wildland firefighters. Safety climate refers to the degree to which an organization's practices emphasize safety over production pressures (Zohar & Luria, 2005). Safety climate constructs assessed in this study include: safety communication, failure learning behaviors, work safety tension, and psychological safety. Based on findings from Study One, I included additional measures to capture crew staffing patterns (dispersed, co-located), work styles (independent, task interdependent), crew prestige, and the value of a wildland firefighting routine referred to as an after action review (AAR). Hypotheses tested and modeled relationships among variables to determine how crew configurations and work styles combined to influence learning behaviors, member comfort with communicating safety concerns, and the value and acceptance of communication and learning practices. To mix the methods from the two studies, I followed an initiation mixed methods design (Greene, Caracelli, & Graham, 1989), in which I examined areas of incongruence between the two studies in order to prompt new insights, and recast how safety is a communicative accomplishment in wildland firefighting workgroups.",,,
1403,"The Art of War: Instability, Insecurity, and the Invention of Traditions in Northern Ireland's Political Wall Murals, 1981--1998","This thesis examines political murals produced during the conflict known as ""The Troubles"" in Northern Ireland. Drawing upon the work of Eric Hobsbawm and Roland Barthes, I argue that murals played a key role in the invention of traditions, a process of crafting a communal self-identification and legitimizing central narrative, which was of crucial concern to groups on both sides. In this regard, murals functioned as a form of mythic speech, attempting to depoliticize and make natural the rhetoric used by the competing groups. Murals served as a highly visible form of both internal and external propaganda, articulating one side's rhetoric while challenging the other's. The grassroots nature of the mural traditions is particularly telling, exposing the deep-seated insecurity of both sides. This insecurity was further reflected by, and a served as a catalyst for, the paramilitary violence that has been a defining characteristic of Northern Ireland for so long.",,,
1404,Multi-scale Properties and Processes in Hierarchically-Structured Organic-Inorganic Solids and Surface-Based Microfluidic Systems,"Hierarchically-structured materials and surface-based microfluidic systems exhibit diverse properties that are inherently multi-scale in origin. In particular, different molecular, mesoscopic, and micron-scale properties and processes are often correlated and collectively account for many properties of interest, such as bulk catalytic activities or electrokinetic flow rates. However, such properties and processes often exhibit complex relationships over the different length scales that are not well understood, and consequently, difficult to control. Establishing correlations between them has been challenging, in part due to the difficulty of rigorously characterizing complex, heterogeneous materials and surface-based microfluidic experiments over multiple length scales, particularly at the molecular and mesoscopic levels. Herein, new multi-scale understanding and correlations have been established for different hierarchically-structured organic-inorganic solids or surface-based microfluidic systems, enabling control of material or device properties over discrete length scales. The molecular-level compositions, structures, interactions, and dynamics have been measured in diverse hierarchically-structured materials, such as mesostructured zeolites, mesostructured organosilicas, and organosiloxane foams, and subsequently correlated with their meso- and macroscopic material structures and properties. The results reveal new insights on the molecular-level interactions that govern their syntheses, the resulting local compositions and material structures, and the relationships among material properties over multiple characteristic length scales. Multi-dimensional solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a cornerstone of these investigations, which enables correlative measurements in multiple frequency dimensions of the through-space or through-bond interactions between the constituent nuclei within the different materials. Other multi-scale relationships have been elucidated theoretically in microfluidic systems that rely on transport near the microchannel surfaces, including devices that use electrokinetic flows or embedded surface sensors. The local ion or analyte concentrations, fluxes, and fluid velocities have been computed in model microfluidic systems, establishing quantitatively the effects of mesoscale surface roughness on micron-scale electro-osmotic flow rates or qualitatively distinct sensing regimes on analyte binding curves. Physically-motivated scaling relations and finite element computations are the foundations of this research, enabling quantitative and intuitive relationships to be derived between quantities such as forces, fluxes, and flow rates. The results are expected to guide rational design strategies aimed at synthesizing novel hierarchically-structured and self-assembled materials with different molecular compositions and framework structures, or similarly, fabricating microfluidic devices with controllable electrokinetic properties or enhanced sensing capabilities. Collectively, the multi-scale approach and molecular-level emphasis, the different materials and microfluidic systems, and new insights contained within this dissertation are expected to be of broad interest to researchers in chemical engineering, materials science, physics, and chemistry.",,,
1406,Standards for support in romantic relationships: The short- and medium-term consequences of receiving (non)responsive support,"The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of emotional support discrepancy (ESD) both immediately after a supportive interaction and in the days following the interaction. One hundred thirteen dating couples came to the communication research laboratory to discuss a topic that was stressful for one of the partners. They also completed measures of their perceptions of themselves, their partners, and their relationship. After completing the laboratory interaction, support recipients reported on their mood and relationship satisfaction, among other variables, once a day for 7 days. Immediately following the laboratory interaction, ESD was indirectly related to positive affect, negative affect, and relationship satisfaction through cognitive reappraisal. In the days following the laboratory interaction, ESD was not associated with future conversations about either the laboratory stressor or stressors that emerged during the week, but ESD was marginally associated with brooding rumination about the laboratory stressor and significantly associated with brooding rumination about the partner's support in general. In addition, multilevel modeling was used to examine the relationship between brooding rumination about the stressor and brooding rumination about the partner's support in general and positive affect, negative affect, and relationship satisfaction. The results revealed that both types of rumination were associated with less positive affect, greater negative affect, and less relationship satisfaction over the course of the week. Likewise, perceived partner responsiveness to emerging stressors (i.e., stressors that emerged during the week following the laboratory interaction) was also associated with greater positive affect and greater relationship satisfaction. The ways in which this study contributes to the literature on social support and avenues for future research are discussed.",,,
1407,The Informal Economy of the Ivory Tower: A Case Study in the University Industrial Complex,"This ethnographic study examined the way the University Industrial Complex creates an informal economy. This study interrogated how the lines between the formal and informal sector are increasingly becoming blurred as both economic systems require a powerful workforce (consisting of faculty, administrators, graduate students, undergraduate students, etc.) whose social reproduction is secured by a powerless army of service workers who live and work in the shadows of the university, that is, in college-towns such as Mountain View. The following methodologies were utilized: ethnography, semi-structured and face-to-face interviews, shadowing, and police ride-a-longs. The findings revealed that an informal economy is internally stratified in what I call a dual-informal economy between powerful students and powerless non-students (Latina/o immigrants, gangs, and alumni). Mountain View's informal economy is not an equal playing field, but it involves a major component of social control, which keep an army of informal laborers in their place through selective criminalization, that is, criminalization of classed and racialized communities who are victimized. In this case, the state especially in the form of the police and other social control agencies criminalize the informal economic activities of the powerless and tends to ignore those of the powerful and privileged sectors. As a consequence, the powerless developed creative responses at the level of their individual and collective agency in order to challenge hyper-criminalization and hyper-surveillance by being covert about their income generating practices. Finally, this ethnography suggests we must refine existing theories in the informal economy.",,,
1408,A Life in Dreams: The Dream Motif in the Poetry of Luo Qilan and Ming-Qing Women Writers,"This thesis examines the Qing female poet, Luo Qilan (1755--1813) and her poems called ""Record of Dreams: Eight Poems"" Ji meng shi ba shou within the larger tradition of dream poetry from male literati and Ming-Qing women writers. The dream motif plays many roles in Chinese poetry, acting as a literary device and expressive tool to fulfill the poet's personal needs, to liberate the poet from the limitations of reality, and to reveal the poet's inner psyche. In particular, this thesis will analyze the differences and similarities between the male and female tradition of dream poetry and show how Luo Qilan engages with both to discover her own voice in dreams. By composing poetry with the dream motif, Luo Qilan explores her identity, meditates on self-reflection, fulfills her desires and transcends both her reality and gender.",,,
1409,Negotiating Authority: The Criminalization of Religious Practice in the United States,"This dissertation utilizes a defendant-centered approach to the study of religion and law as a way to understand religious communities whose practices have been criminalized. Rather than asking about the legality of laws criminalizing religious practice, this dissertation asks how religious individuals and communities negotiated competing claims of authority over their religious practice. Shifting the analysis to the defendants increases our understanding of the development and, in some cases, escalation of conflicts between religious communities and the state. This approach also helps us to see how these conflicts are catalysts for change not only in the teachings and practices of the religious community but also in the construction and enforcement of the law. Drawing on archived trial transcripts, letters, local newspapers, and taped interviews, this dissertation analyzes the criminalization of the Ghost Dance among the Lakota in 1890, the fraud trials of the leaders of the ""I AM"" Activity in the early 1940s, and the criminal prosecutions of serpent handlers in the 1940s and 1970s in order to address why some religious practices are criminalized while others are not. Each case study represents one of the three groups most commonly targeted with criminal laws: Native Americans, metaphysical movements, and Christian sects. Each case study is also chosen from one of the three eras when the criminalization of religious practice peaked: the Gilded Age and Progressive Era, the Roosevelt administration, and the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s. The comparative nature of this project highlights the ways groups are treated differently by the government based on their proximity to white, normative understandings of religion. By defining an action as criminal, the government articulates the limits of tolerance, marks the frontier of the abnormal, places a value on conformity, and encourages an optimum behavior toward which all should strive. Therefore, by investigating criminal prosecutions of religious practitioners, we gain a better understanding of the shifting boundary between deviant criminal activity and constitutionally protected religious practice as well as the role of the state in policing this boundary and reinforcing hegemonic understandings of ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" religion.",,,
1410,The detection of infection with electrochemical DNA biosensors,"The drive underlying my research has been the development of analytical methods for the detection and identification of infection that are rapid and convenient enough to deploy directly at the point-of-care. To this end, my studies have focused on the use of electrochemical DNA biosensors for the detection of both amplified pathogen DNA and host-produced, pathogen-specific antibodies. Here I describe the characterization and application of these E-DNA sensors for the detection of various amplified products indicative of infection. A significant hurdle in the point-of-care detection of PCR products is that they are double-stranded, rendering them difficult to detect directly using traditional hybridization methods. In response, we have developed a novel biosensor platform capable of detecting double stranded DNA. This sensor comprises a linear E-DNA probe that employs triplex-forming nucleotides as its recognition element. Specifically, I developed sensors containing a single stranded DNA probe that selectively hybridizes within the major groove of a specific double stranded DNA target via reverse Hoogsteen base pairing to form a triple helix. Here we demonstrate the versatility of this detection platform by creating sensors that can bind to either polypurine or polypyrimidine tracts present in double stranded DNA. Both sensors rapidly and specifically detect their double-stranded DNA targets at concentrations as low as _10 nM and are selective enough to be employed directly in complex sample matrices such as blood serum. To illustrate this, I have demonstrated the sensor's ability detect unpurified, double-stranded PCR amplicons containing the relevant conserved HIV1 sequence. Our second biosensor system avoids the problem of detecting double-stranded amplification products by employing an amplification method that produces single- stranded targets. Specifically, I have integrated such amplification with sequence- specific E-DNA detection in a single, monolithic microfluidic chip. This Integrated Microfluidic Electrochemical DNA (IMED) chip consists of an amplification chamber that supports loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), a rapid, single-temperature amplification method that produces single-stranded products readily amenable to hybridization-based detection. To demonstrate the clinical diagnostic utility of the IMED chips, which conferred rapid (under 2 hr) detection and discrimination of specific Salmonella serovars at clinically relevant < 1000 CFU/ml levels, I have demonstrated their ability to monitor pathogens in whole, unprocessed blood collected from an animal model of sepsis. Moving beyond the detection of pathogen-specific nucleic acids, I closed my thesis work with the development of a sensor architecture for the detection of anti- pathogen antibodies. Termed scaffold sensors, these detect antibodies by displaying an antigen (or epitope) on the distal end of the DNA probe. This approach supports the rapid (< 10 min), single-step measurement of antibodies directly in seroconverted human serum at concentrations more than a thousand-fold below those found in authentic patient samples. This sensor also offers quantitative measurements of antibody concentrations in seroconverted patient sera in the days following infection.",,,
1411,Hybrid Silicon AWG Lasers and Buffers,"Silicon photonics promises the low cost integration of optical components with CMOS electronics thus enabling optical interconnects in future generation processors. The hybrid silicon platform (HSP) is one approach to make optically active components on silicon. While many optical components on the HSP have been demonstrated, few photonic integrated circuits (PICs), consisting of multiple elements, have been demonstrated. In this dissertation, two Hybrid Silicon PICs and their building blocks will be presented. The first PIC to be presented is a multiwavelength laser based on an AWG. It consists of Fabry--Perot cavities integrated with hybrid silicon amplifiers and an intracavity filter in the form of an AWG with a channel spacing of 360 GHz. Four-channel lasing operation is shown. Single-sided fiber-coupled output powers as high as 35 microW are measured. The SMSR is as high as 35 dB. Various device characteristics are compromised as the AWG was attacked during the III-V process, thus showing the need to properly protect passive components during III-V processing. The second PIC to be presented is a fully integrated optical buffer. The device consists of a hybrid silicon switch, a 1.1 m long silicon waveguide, and cascaded hybrid silicon amplifiers. The passive delay line is protected by dielectric layers to limit passive losses to 0.5 dB/cm. Noise filters in the form of saturable absorbers are integrated in the buffer to allow for a larger number of recirculations in the delay line compared to a delay without filters. Tapers are used to transition the mode from the passive region to the hybrid region with losses as low as 0.22 dB per transition and reflectivities below -35 dB. Error free operation of the hybrid silicon switch is demonstrated in all four paths. The integrated buffer failed due to low yield, showing the current limitations of the HSP.",,,
1412,"Archetypes of the Veiled Other: Visual culture, travel literature, and the male gaze in the construction of the Spanish Morisca and the Peruvian Tapada, 1530-1900","This thesis traces the construction of popular images of the veiled female figure in Spain and Peru, through the eyes of male artists and writers. I focus on the creation of two distinct archetypes of veiled women, the Morisca in sixteenth-century Spain and the Tapada in nineteenth-century Peru, and how these male-constructed identities increasingly reinforced notions of sexuality and eroticism of the forbidden in the popular imagination. I examine how these distinct identities centered on very different uses of the veil, and how the women's perceived sense of agency through manipulation of the garment created ambivalent elements of desire and anxiety, contributing to male fascination with their images, while also cementing preconceived notions of the veiled female ""Other"" in the European imagination. By analyzing costume books, travel narratives, paintings, and photographs of these types, I demonstrate how the veil not only shaped the artists' perceptions of these women, but also how the viewer, or consumer of the artists' works understood these types in a much broader context, allowing the exaggerated characterizations of these women to represent entire populations and nations as the exotic Other. The veil became an interchangeable symbol of femininity and modesty, and, for some women, an emblem of freedom from surveillance in a highly patriarchal world. The varying degree that women used the veil to obscure their faces (in whole or in part) would lead to scandal and official censure, as well as a great deal of attention from male artists and writers. The men who drew, painted, and wrote about veiled women increasingly altered and shaped their images, an evolution I identify in the shifting textual and pictorial representations of the veil itself. The fantasy (or fear) of what lies beneath the veil prompted many male artists to expose the faces of their veiled subjects, if only on the surface of their canvases or the pages of their travel journals. All of these elements of exoticism derived from the presence of the veil, the element that would lead to the construction of the recognizable archetypes of the Spanish Morisca and the Peruvian Tapada.",,,
1413,Incorporating a Data Collection Component into Parent Education Sessions of Parents of Children with Autism,"Parent education has been found to be an efficient means of providing intervention services to children with autism and has been linked to improved parent and child outcomes. Despite the empirically supported finding that parent education programs lead to positive outcomes, few studies have looked at how parent education should be conducted. In addition, there continues to be a large attrition rate from parent education programs and researchers suggest that variables associated with dropout rates be examined. The literature suggests that being involved in the selection of treatment goals may be one variable associated with continued involvement in parent education programs as parents appear particularly invested in selecting treatment goals that are meaningful to their family. Although, collecting data on a child's performance would allow parents to evaluate progress towards a meaningful goal, little research has been conducted in this area. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of adding a data collection component to a typical parent education program of practice with feedback. Specifically, the study examined whether training parents on how to take data on specific goals will (1) improve procedural fidelity, (2) improve interspersal of acquisition and maintenance teaching opportunities presented to the child, (3) decrease parent stress, (4) increase parent confidence, (5) increase the child's performance on the target goal, and (6) increase the child's overall responsivity? A multiple baseline across three participants was used to assess the effects of the data collection component. The results suggest that a data collection component helps parents reach procedural fidelity and leads to improvements in observed parent stress and confidence levels. Additionally, improvements in child measures were also noted. Specifically, all three children showed increases in correct responding on the target goal and overall responsivity towards their parents.",,,
1414,"Incorporation of salt-rich dust from Owens Lake playa in soils along the Sierra Nevada piedmont: Soil properties, and ionic and isotopic ratios as provenance tracers","Global anthropogenic desiccation of lake basins in arid and semi-arid areas result in substantial increases in the flux of aeolian material. In California, Owens Lake playa has produced a tremendous amount of windblown dust since its desiccation in the early 20th century. In view of the potential danger to human health of the dust blowing off the playa, the chemistry and mineralogy of playa sediments and dust are well known. By contrast, the impact of the dust on surrounding soils and ecosystems in Owens Valley has been less well studied. This dissertation documents the accumulation of dust-derived salts from Owens Lake playa in nearby alluvial soils sourced from Sierra Nevada granite. I evaluate patterns of electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and pH as proxies of salt incorporation with respect to depth in the soil profiles and with distance from the playa. I use two different approaches to determine whether salts measured in soils are derived from playa dust: arsenic (As) and ionic ratios of sodium (Na), lithium (Li), and calcium (Ca) to other major soil cations; and Sr isotopic ratios of 87Sr/86Sr. These are the first data to document the fate of Owens Lake playa dust in surrounding alluvial soils. Results indicate that playa dust is the source of salt levels found in soils more than 20 km away. More importantly, soils in direct proximity of the playa show a significant impact from playa-derived salt input. Based on extremely elevated salt levels in soils on the playa side of the nearby Alabama Hills, topography and variable wind-flow directions have important effects on sites downwind of dust sources; and these factors may be more important than mere distance from the playa in influencing the impact of salt-rich dust on soils along the Sierra Nevada alluvial piedmont. An evaluation of the severity of the impact of the playa dust on soils is a critical step toward assessing management decisions related to Owens Lake playa as well as many other lake basins that are rapidly desiccating under human influence.",,,
1416,Theoretical Study of Material and Device Properties of Group-III Nitrides,"Group-III nitride semiconductors, including AlN, GaN, InN, and their alloys, are ideal materials for solid state lighting applications. Current research focuses on improving the efficiency by improvements in materials quality and novel device designs, for instance based on nonpolar and semipolar growth. The motivation for our work is to assist and guide the experimental development of high-performance solid state optoelectronic devices by performing computational studies. Our investigations range from basic structural and electronic properties of nitrides to the effects of device design on efficiency of light emission. In the area of fundamental properties, we performed a systematic study of strain effects on the electronic band structures of the group-III-nitrides (AlN, GaN and InN) using density-functional theory with an advanced hybrid functional as well as using the quasiparticle GW method. We present a complete set of deformation potentials that allows us to predict the band positions of group-III nitrides and their alloys (InGaN and AlGaN) under realistic strain conditions. We then employed the resulting first-principles deformation potentials to predict the effects of strain on transition energies and valence-band structures of c-plane, nonpolar, and semipolar InGaN alloy layers grown on GaN substrates, with particular attention to the role of strain in the polarized light emission. We also investigated the role of native defects in the optical properties of GaN and AlN, again using hybrid density-functional calculations. We established that complexes between Mg and nitrogen vacancies lead to the broad red luminescence that has often been observed in GaN. We find that isolated nitrogen vacancies can give rise to broad emission peaked at 2.18 eV. We show that isolated aluminum vacancies lead to an absorption peak at 3.43 eV and an emission peak at 2.73 eV. We also find that the complexes can give rise to absorption peaked at 3.97 eV and emission peaked at 3.24 eV. These results indicate that Al vacancies and their complexes with oxygen lead to distinct UV absorption lines that have hampered development of UV-transparent AlN substrates. We also investigate the optical excitation of the bulk AlN and the nitrogen vacancies in AlN using ab initio many-body perturbation theory. Our calculations show that many-body effect strongly affects the absorption spectrum of AlN and a localized exciton is formed around the vacancy. Finally, we have carried out device simulations based on k.p theory and Schrodinger-Poisson solvers to investigate the role of strain, polarization and doping in performance of nitride-based LED devices. We elucidate the mechanisms by which modification of GaN barriers by Mg doping benefits hole transport, and we demonstrate how the strain-induced polarization field affects wavefunction overlap in the quantum wells of the c-plane and nonpolar plane LEDs and is related to the droop problem. We show that the emission wavelength shift under current injection is also related with quantum well potential profile and the polarization field inside quantum wells. These simulations shed light on the improvement of nitride-based LED efficiency by device design.",,,
1417,Strain Effects of Single and Co-doped Rare Earth Arsenide Nanoparticles on Epitaxial (001) Gallium Arsenide,"The inclusion of rare earth arsenide nanoparticles in III-V semiconductor films is an ongoing area of interest for thermoelectric and terahertz sensor research. These films, typically grown by molecular beam epitaxy, have been observed to exhibit strain behavior which is not accurately predicted by simple linear averaging based on alloy composition i.e. Vegard's Law. Although this non-Vegard-like behavior is by no means novel in itself, the cause of the behavior in the specific case of rare earth nanoparticles in III-Vs has not been studied extensively. Researchers have recently begun investigating films co-doped with multiple species of rare earth nanoparticle in order to achieve lattice matching to a particular substrate or to improve thermoelectric properties. The strain behavior of these co-doped films is similarly lacking in study. In order to rectify this lack of understanding, a systematic study of erbium arsenide and scandium arsenide particles in gallium arsenide is conducted. Films of nanoparticle-doped GaAs are grown by molecular beam epitaxy and are characterized in situ by reflected high-energy electron diffraction and ex situ by high-resolution x-ray diffraction. It is reaffirmed that ErAs produces a superdilation of the GaAs lattice constant and it is newly observed that ScAs produces a supercontraction. The combination of these lattice distortions is roughly linear and is used to correctly predict the relative concentrations required for a lattice-matched co-doped film. GaAs exhibits an asymmetric strain response to rare earth arsenides with positive and negative lattice mismatches, undergoing greater dilation than contraction for nanoparticles of equal mismatch magnitude. Several mechanisms known to produce superdilation or supercontraction in other doped semiconductor systems are examined and compared with the properties of the ErAs+ScAs:GaAs system to try and explain these behaviors. A new lattice misfit model is proposed which explains the lattice distortions primarily in terms of heavily distorted bond lengths at the interfaces between particles and the surrounding matrix. This model agrees well with measurements of ErAs:GaAs films and is used to predict an interfacial bond length for ScAs:GaAs which can be checked in a future study.",,,
1418,Genetic diversity and its relationship to host-specificity of a trematode parasite (Acanthoparyphium spinulosum),"Host specificity is an important component of parasite ecology, determining the extent to which hosts are susceptible to infection by a particular parasite species at any given stage in its development. It can greatly influence the ecology of any stage in a parasite's life cycle plays and plays a significant role in parasite evolution. A parasite with broad host-specificity can be subdivided by host use into subpopulations. This in turn may affect the genetic diversity and the fate of the alleles under selection in a component parasite population, all individuals of a particular life stage in all hosts. If populations remain isolated for long periods of time, each sub-population may evolve to be a new species. Thus, understanding the relationship between host specificity and genetic diversity can help us to understand both the ecology and evolution of any parasite species with a complex life cycle. The larval stages of trematode parasite Acanthoparyphium spinulosum infect various invertebrates in Californian estuaries. Previously, A. spinulsoum have been considered to be a single species despite the broad host-use pattern. Together with non-overlapping distributions of second intermediate hosts within a wetland could result in population segregation by host use. To this end, genetic data was gathered for both mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and the nuclear internal transcribed spacer 1(ITS1) loci from first intermediate hosts. Results suggest that A. spinulosum morphospecies represents a complex of cryptic species, which is differentially distributed between sites in Northern versus Southern California. Similarly, genetic data was obtained for parasites from second intermediate host species for COI and ITSI loci. Results from this larval stage suggest population segregation by second intermediate host use, such that metacercariae from Cerithidea californica all belonged to one clade. Metacercariae data from a clam and polychaete second intermediate host belonged to another clade. Finally, experimental infections were conducted to test the compatibility of the described genotypes (Chapter 2 and 3) for different second intermediate hosts. Fluorescent dye was used to distinguish between pre-existing and experimental infections. Experimental data suggest a relationship between compatibility of different parasite genotypes to different host species.",,,
1419,Workspace Media: The Rise of the Procrastination Economy and the Future of Entertainment,"As digital technologies have become a part of our daily lives, scholars have raised concerns that digital media are making us more isolated, alienated, and economically exploited. But in my research on the production, distribution, depiction, and reception of digital content in the workplace, I found that online culture is more dynamic. I argue that the workplace is an important location for the consumption and circulation of digital culture as well as an ideal context for understanding how digital technologies factor into the media industries. Following a ""site-specific"" ethnographic approach, I observed a dozen workplaces, interviewed a variety of creative workers, and found that assumptions about digital media have less to do with technological capabilities and more to do with the business strategies of the media industries and cultural anxieties about the proliferation of global capitalism. My findings show that digital technologies are revealing the relationship between cultural producers and consumers by externalizing behaviors and practices previously hidden.",,,
1420,From Ladies to Organizers: Gender Imagination in the Experiences of Women Cooperative Leaders,"This ethnographic study examines women's political agency within a woman's cooperative. The everyday practices of organizers are studied to understand the relationship between their experiences of gender inequality, women's vision of themselves as political actors, and the triple shift. Of interest are the contexts and processes that led organizers to create autonomous women's organizations in order to address women's social and economic issues. Contemporary studies examining women in cooperatives in Central and Latin America have primarily focused on the gendered division of labor, women as ""participants,"" and how these organizations impact women's economic and educational development. Few studies examine the processes of transformation for women organizers and what leads women to stay involved in social change. In an attempt to address this literature gap, the Ladies of CoopeCafe, a women's cooperative located in rural Costa Rica, serves as a primary site to re-examine this relationship. As an ethnography of a woman's cooperative, I observed organization activities, interviewed seven leaders, held three group interviews, and collected archival documents. Findings suggest that women's political agency and imagination of gender are transformed through their everyday life experiences in the triple shift. Their political agency is further developed by their experiences of organizing. It is from continued gender inequality and unmet gendered needs that women organizers create new spaces to address women's social and economic issues. Therefore, cooperatives for women organizers serve as sites for transformation of women's political consciousness and for women's continued social and political involvement.",,,
1421,Methods for Controlling the Properties and Function of Organic Semiconductors,"A donor-acceptor type of narrow-bangap polymer, poly[(4,4-didodecyldithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]silole)-2,6-diyl- alt-(2,1,3-benzoxadiazole)-4,7-diyl], was synthesized as an electron donor material for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. Processing a BHJ solar cell with the narrow-bandgap polymer and a fullerene derivative (PC 71BM) results in a smooth surface morphology, and better performance is observed when 1-chloronaphthalene solvent additive is used. The smooth surface enables the introduction of a titanium suboxide (TiOx) optical spacer between the BHJ layer and the electrode, which increases light absorption by redistributing the light intensity. TiOx incorporation leads to increases in the device performance and lifetime. Further optimization of the BHJ solar cell using the narrow-bandgap polymer and PC71BM was achieved by end-capping the chain ends with thiophene fragments. This structural modification yields materials which are more thermally robust and that can be used in devices with thicker films; important considerations for enabling mass production of plastic solar cells. In addition, a new donor-acceptor type small molecule using a dithienothiophene (DTT) unit and a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivative has been synthesized for application in organic solar cells. The topographic surfaces of the solar cell devices blending with PC71 BM showed large cluster formation which caused poor device performance. The use of additive prevented cluster formation leading to improved device characteristics. It was found that allowing solutions of a low bandgap polymer to stand in a solvent of marginal quality leads to interchain aggregation. These supramolecular structures lead to thin films with higher charge carrier mobilities and internal order, as determined by the fabrication of thin film transistors and grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements, respectively. Aging of solutions is therefore a straightforward method to modify the optoelectronic properties of solution-processable organic semiconductors. Furthermore, by dipping into hexane, it is possible to efficiently eliminate the low molecular weight component and improve molecular ordering. These changes improve the performance of field-effect transistors. The correlation between the nanoscalar structural features and the electrical properties enables us to determine both the appropriate dipping time and how the low molecular weight component influences electronic properties.",,,
1422,Maternal educational expectations and Latina adolescents' childbearing attitudes: The mediating roles of communication about education and daughters' educational expectations,"Research suggests that parents' expectations for their adolescents' college attainment contribute to their adolescents' expectations, and that adolescent girls' expectations to attend college play a role in preventing and postponing teenage pregnancy. Through structural equation modeling, the present investigation examined the influence of maternal educational expectations on their daughters' childbearing attitudes and whether it was mediated through communication about education and the daughters' educational expectations. One hundred and forty-six Latina adolescent girls and their mothers from low-income backgrounds completed measures tapping into their educational expectations as measured by their certainty regarding whether the girls could reach their educational goals, communication about education, the girls' desired childbearing ages and their attitudes toward teenage pregnancy. In addition to survey measures, educational communication was assessed by coding educational messages in videotaped mother-daughter conversations about dating and sexuality. Results indicated that mothers with higher educational expectations engaged in more communication with their daughters about the value of education, which in turn was associated with the daughters having more rejecting attitudes toward teenage pregnancy. Mothers' and daughters' expectations were positively associated, and daughters' high expectations was linked to desires to have a first child at older ages. Findings suggest that girls with high expectations expect childbearing to conflict with their chances of obtaining a college degree. The findings also highlight the need for mothers to communicate their expectations and values on education regularly to and include messages about the importance of education when talking to daughters about sexuality to prevent teenage pregnancy.",,,

However, by reading the tenets of rasa as suggestions for the compositional process rather than that of textual enjoyment, some details concerning how a poet may produce a work that evokes rasa emerge, including the important role of sound in poetic composition.",,,
1424,Investigating the Role of Gro/TLE Degradation During Bit1-mediated Cell Death,"Cell death from ECM-detachment, or anoikis, is a conserved cell death pathway that plays an important role in both development and tumorigenesis. Development of anoikis resistance is a critical requirement for metastatic cancer cells. The human Bit1 protein has been shown to be a powerful regulator of anoikis signaling. Bit1 is a very enigmatic protein in that it is capable of producing two seemingly opposite phenomena. These are the pro-survival observation of the PTH domain of Bit1 (C-terminus) and the pro-death observation of the cell death domain of Bit1 (N-terminus). Both of these functions that have been seen experimentally and are intrinsically linked to one over-arching structure, the Bit1 protein itself. My task through this thesis has been to understand the essence of the Bit1-cell death pathway and to help determine how Bit1 can elicit a specific but lethal cell death response during anoikis. It has been previously shown that Bit1 is needed to be in the cytoplasm to be apoptotic. Further, cytoplasmic Bit1 requires binding to the AES protein to execute anoikis signaling. However, it is not known what effect Bit1 binding has on AES and how this binding event can trigger cell death. To address this question, co-transfection experiments were performed with cytoplasmic localized Bit1 (or various truncated Bit1 fragments) and FLAG-AES (Chapter 3). Surprisingly, Bit1 caused a decrease in the amount of AES species in the co-transfected cells, indicating that Bit1 is able to on some level down-regulate the AES protein. This effect was also seen with another Groucho/TLE (Gro/TLE) family member TLE-1. In Chapter 3, I will present data showing that this Bit1-induced down-regulation is actually a degradation pathway. In Chapter 4, I will show evidence that the Gro/TLE proteins are being degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner since proteasome inhibitors where able to rescue both AES and TLE1 protein down-regulation. Taken together, these data show that Bit1 is able to target AES and TLE-1 to the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that during anoikis, these proteins need to be degraded for proper cell death signaling.",,,

1426,"The Legal, Ecological, and Economic Landscape for Rights-Based Fishery Management in the United States","This dissertation considers how law, ecology, and economics interface in the context of rights-based fishery management. The findings are presented in three chapters, each structured as an independent journal article. Each chapter begins with a general overview of the ecological and economic incentives for rights-based fishery management, followed by an in-depth discussion of the particular approach under consideration. Chapter one focuses on ""territorial use rights in fisheries"" (TURFs), a spatial, property rights-based fishery management technique. I analyze the viability of instituting TURFs in California state waters under existing law, including the Marine Life Protection Act and the Marine Life Management Act. I conclude that while the policy rationales undergirding existing law and regulation support the idea of TURF management, they do not expressly provide for TURF implementation. Given that California lacks TURF-specific policy, I consider in chapter two what such a policy might look like and what the effects of that policy might be. To address these questions, my collaborators and I developed an ecosystem service tradeoff analysis model for the southern California red sea urchin fishery. Our model compares the tradeoffs between fish biomass and fishery profit under four management regimes: a fleet model, a TURF system without revenue sharing, a TURF with revenue sharing, and optimal spatial management. We find that a TURF system's performance depends upon the degree of revenue sharing among fishermen. Our goal in this chapter is not to identify the ""best"" management option for this fishery; rather, we seek to introduce ecosystem service tradeoff analysis to a new audience---the law and policy community---and demonstrate how this tool can help decision-makers gauge the costs and benefits of various regulatory regimes. The third chapter considers how antitrust law affects the formation and operation of fishery cooperatives. I conducted a synthetic literature review of past research, new case law, and emerging statutory guidance. I conclude that antitrust law continues to exert a chilling effect on fishery cooperatives. Most problematic from both conservation and economic standpoints is the constraint antitrust law places on a cooperative's ability to voluntarily restrict harvest below a governmentally-defined total allowable catch.",,,
1427,Ammonothermal Growth of Gallium Nitride,"Bulk, single crystal Gallium Nitride (GaN) crystals are essential for enabling high performance electronic and optoelectronic devices by providing arbitrarily oriented, high quality, large, single crystal GaN substrates. Methods of producing single crystals of sufficient size and quality at a rate that would enable successful commercialization has been a major focus for research groups and companies worldwide. Recent advances have demonstrated remarkable improvements, though high cost and lack of high volume production remain key challenges. Major investments in bulk GaN growth were made at UCSB with particular focus on the ammonothermal method. The existing lab was upgraded and a new facility was designed and built with improved experimental setups for ammonothermal growth of GaN. The facilities can simultaneously operate up to 15 reactors of differing designs and capabilities with the ability to grow crystals up to 2 inches in diameter. A novel in-situ technique was devised to investigate the growth chemistry which occurs at typical operating conditions of 3,000 atm and 600 C. Improvements in ammonothermal GaN include improved growth rates for c-plane by a factor of four to 344 mum/day with an overall record growth rate of 544 mum/day achieved for the (1122) plane. Crystal qualities comparable to that of the seed crystal were achieved. Impurity concentrations for transition metals were consistently reduced by a factor of 100 to concentrations below 1017 atoms/cm3. Optical transparency was improved by significantly reducing the yellow coloration typically seen for ammonothermal GaN. Single crystal GaN was successfully grown on large seeds and a 1 inch x _ inch x _ inch GaN crystal was demonstrated. To better understand the growth chemistry, models were created for the decomposition of ammonia under growth conditions, with initial experiments performed using the designed in-situ setup to verify the model's accuracy. To investigate the surface morphology and stability of basic ammonothermal GaN, various off-oriented HVPE GaN seed crystals were grown on and analyzed for growth rate, crystal quality, impurity incorporation, optical absorption, and surface morphology. A natural tendency for m-plane to off-orient itself by 0.5-1.5 towards-c-plane was observed, along with a region of apparent surface stability ranging from m-plane to {1011}.",,,
1428,Exploring the Impact of WPAs' Leadership at Two-Year Colleges,"Currently, two-year colleges are teaching the lion's share of college composition classes, mainly consisting of developmental writing and first-year composition courses; however, those same two-year colleges have been slow in embracing the composition theory and practices that are studied and implemented at four-year colleges. One way to disseminate a compositionally-centered agenda throughout two-year colleges is through strong leadership. Using principles of organizational learning and leadership, this research explored the impact of English department chairs' educational backgrounds on their departments. A mixed method approach was used to examine the two selected department chairs. One department chair, from college A (AC), has a Ph.D. in composition while the other, from C College (CC), has a traditional masters degree in English. Existing organizational learning surveys were adapted to better fit English department concerns, and they were administered to both sets of English faculty, both full-time and part-time members. Once the surveys were completed and calculated, each department chair was interviewed as a way to triangulate the survey data and flesh out each department chair's departmental vision. 90 of the 159 surveys (56.6%) were completed in total between the two colleges, and each department chair interview lasted roughly 80 minutes. After analyzing both sets of data, it was found that both colleges show evidence of organizational learning; nevertheless, the department chairs articulated significantly different organizational intentions. The department chairs' differing intentions and their impacts on their departments were analyzed and seen to impact faculty interaction, faculty's perception of their position, and departmental hiring practices. Due to these ramifications of department chair vision, the study asserts two-year college English departments would be better served if led by strong compositionally-focused leaders.",,,
1429,Spatial estimates of snow water equivalent in the Sierra Nevada,"The spatial distribution of snow and its melt over large river basins cannot be directly observed, complicating decisions for competing priorities of flood protection and resource use. This work aims to advance our ability to estimate snow distribution through improvements in the satellite observation of snow-covered area (SCA) and the modeling of snow water equivalent (SWE). I analyze the accuracies of three methods to map SCA from MODIS, a binary and a fractional method (MOD10A1) based on the normalized difference snow index (NDSI), and another fractional method based on spectral mixture analyses, MODSCAG. I find that fractional SCA estimates from MODSCAG perform best over a range of snow and vegetation conditions and the model maintains its retrieval ability in the transitional periods during accumulation and melt. Forest obstructs viewable snow cover, and satellite-viewing geometry has a larger effect on the fractional NDSI-based approach than MODSCAG. Adjustments to SCA to account for forest canopies permit MODSCAG to perform very well in all but the densest canopies while MOD10A1 shows early melt out, when compared with ground sensors, in sparse to moderately dense canopy. Combining satellite observed SCA and albedo with an energy balance model, I estimate spatially distributed snow water equivalent for 12 years in the Sierra Nevada. The model shows that the relationship of SWE with elevation is significantly different for wet, mean and dry years, between drainages and at different latitudes. SWE and SCA become increasingly correlated from March 1st to July 1st, such that real time SCA observations may be sufficient for SWE prediction. I compare spatially integrated volumes of snow water equivalent from this model and two real-time models with full natural flow estimates in 18 Sierra Nevada basins covering 70% of the streamflow range in the last 80 years. Forecasting errors that are based on statistical relationships between point measurements of snow and streamflow in these basins can reach 25% to 70% in one out of five years, a large error where reservoirs hold only the annual streamflow. The retrospective model best estimates the unimpaired streamflow and provides a way to evaluate the real-time models.",,,
1430,Topics in Probabilistic Graphical Models,"Complex networks involve interplay of several entities with each other that results in dependence in these entities. This dependence has often a modular structure that should be exploited for efficient inference and decision making. We present a survey of inference, learning, and decision making in such complex networks depicted as probabilistic graphical models. In particular, we focus on four particular problems in graphical models: (i) efficient computation of marginal and conditional probabilities; (ii) efficient parameter estimation; (iii) efficient structural learning; and (iv) decision making. We present the models in which exact solution is tractable and elucidate on the associated algorithms. We also present approximate solution techniques for general graphical models.",,,
1431,Maurice Ravel as Miniaturist through the Lens of Japonisme,"Maurice Ravel is understood as a quintessential French composer. Yet, curiously, scholarship lacks consensus in defining his music and its relationship to that of his contemporaries. Contributing to the discrepancy are various writings that characterize Ravel's style as miniaturist, often described as both ""classical"" and reflective of his enthusiasm for East Asian art. Polymath musicologist Louis Laloy, a driving force in the French reception of l'Extreme-Orient, even described Ravel's music as japonisante and similar to Japanese landscapes. In defining the wider implications of these seemingly disparate reactions, the dissertation proposes that Ravel's musical textures exemplify French classicism's interaction with the late nineteenth-and early twentieth-century trend known as japonisme in vogue from around 1870 to 1935. Since the 1870s, japonisme has marked the reception and aesthetic impact of Japanese graphics on formal design in Paris throughout the arts and letters. In the absorption of style japonais, wood-block prints known as ukiyo-e became closely associated with miniaturism---the craft of expressing profundity or intensity of feeling within a limited space or time. Ravel is a viable and intriguing case study because his musical textures suggest a familiarity with ukiyo-e, particularly the prints and sketchbooks (Manga) of Katsushika Hokusai. As explained here, Ravel's deft evocations of classic and exotic intertwine japonisme and French classicism, an interaction not widely explored in musicology. The introduction defines Ravel's miniaturism as a response to japonisme's complex of style changes and proposes a sight-sound analytical methodology inspired by the study of ukiyo-e graphics. Chapter 1 investigates interactions between French classicism and japonisme and interprets Ravel's textural style as japonist-classicist. Chapter 2 explains Ravel's miniaturism through the lens of Hokusai's ukiyo-e. Chapter 3 applies the implications of the previous chapters to an analytical interpretation of the first movement of the duo Sonata for Violin and Cello, a chamber piece interpreted here as a japonist-classicist symphony. Chapter 4 concludes that approaching Ravel's music through japonisme demystifies the miniaturist label. Likewise it opens a fresh research space for studying the music of Ravel and his contemporaries in terms of East-West encounters and through the perspective of composer as craftsman.",,,
1432,Imagining the End: Apocalyptic Imagery in Visual Media,"Apocalyptic imagery is a common element in 20th and 21 st century popular culture. Such imagery, largely consisting of dualism, tragedy, eschatology and messianism, draws upon two millennia worth of apocalyptic history. Emerging out of ancient Judaism and Christianity, western apocalypticism found its most enduring and influential forms in Revelation and the Book of Daniel. Tracing the themes of the apocalyptic imagination from ancient times into contemporary popular culture clearly shows that dualism, tragedy, eschatology and messianism underwrite the authority of popular media. These four aspects of apolcayptic imagery appear in secular films and games, as illustrated in The Matrix trilogy, The Terminator series, and Avatar, and in the Massively Multiplayer Online game, World of Warcraft. The religiously apocalyptic elements of these and similar films and games make the fictional stories richer and more detailed, as well as making them more appealing and convincing to modern audiences. As a consequence, popular films and games are important media through which ancient religious ideas percolate through modern culture, and which simultaneously sustain the ancient ideas and images.",,,
1433,Just War for Global Justice,"Can poor countries fight a just war to enforce global distributive justice? This dissertation applies just war theory to explore the conditions in which such a war is morally permitted. I argue that global justice should aim at meeting people's basic needs by promoting economic development of poor countries. This demand for global justice is triggered by the fact that the state system, sustained by coercion, influences people's life prospects profoundly and pervasively. When the rich and high income countries fail to discharge their duties, assigned by what I call The Commission of Development Aid, to assist poor countries' economic developments, their failure constitutes a just cause of war. When waging war for global justice, poor countries should have the right intention to observe all requirements of jus ad bellum and jus in bello. Only legitimate governments of poor countries have the legitimate authority to wage this war because of their legitimate authority to distribute resources in the domestic realm. A war for global justice should receive authorization from the Security Council or, at least, from the General Assembly. Finally, war for global justice does not necessarily fail to satisfy the requirements of reasonable chance of success, last resort, and proportionality.",,,
1434,"Three Essays on Adaptation, Uncertainty, and Learning","Adaptation to exogenous change in the economy and environment occurs on both intensive and extensive margins. Whether and how one accounts for human adaptation directly affects estimates of the economic consequences of environmental change, estimates that are both critical in informing policy decisions and notoriously difficult to value. Chapter 1 introduces and applies an analytical framework for placing an economic value on adaptation. We explore the issue first in a stylized model that facilitates making concrete generalizations about the kinds of adaptations that generate high or low economic value. We then test the soundness of our insights by incorporating learning and adaptive decision-making into a structural dynamic forestry model with changing climate conditions and uncertain prices. Chapter 2 concerns the value of learning-by-investing in an energy technology R&D; program. It analyzes a portfolio choice problem that is not addressed by portfolio theory: how does an R&D; policymaker optimally invest in diverse technologies with uncertain potentials? It introduces a new approach, which recognizes the informational return from experimental investments (the value of learning-by-investing), assuming the amount the investor learns about the potential of a new technology will depend on how much he invested in that technology. In order to characterize the value of this endogenous learning, I develop a dynamic portfolio optimization model of investment as an information acquisition activity, incorporated with a Bayesian linear regression as the expectation revision mechanism, and solved with stochastic dynamic programming. Motivated by funding in energy R&D; at the national level, the model is demonstrated using technology benefit estimates and risk assessments merged with historical U.S. Department of Energy budget data. This paper contributes to R&D; portfolio theory and energy policy, and in so doing, rethinks performance metrics for evaluating energy R&D; projects, calls into question status quo federal energy R&D; policy, and ultimately reshapes the way economists analyze a certain class of portfolio investment. One analytical result shows that Modern Portfolio Theory can lead to a suboptimal portfolio choice because it ignores the expected value of learning from an investment. However, if the decision maker follows the Bayesian approach, both theoretical insight and illustrative numerical simulations indicate the gains may be substantial. Much attention has been devoted to the causes and effects of economic inequality. An acknowledged factor of inequality is innate ability, which is often used to justify a certain degree of inequality in a meritocratic society. Chapter 3 investigates an asymmetric merit pay hypothesis, which proposes the effects of inequality on worker effort must take into account differences in innate worker ability. In order to explore this hypothesis, we devise a novel experimental mechanism for generating endogenous asymmetric wage assignments between the employer and the employees within an organization. This mechanism 1) credibly assigns ability levels to employees and 2) credibly injects employer uncertainty about these ability levels. It allows us to isolate the ability and effort effects on organizational productivity. We are also able to differentiate insurance versus equity motives for wage compression.",,,
1435,Design Principles of RNA-based Scaffolds for Applications in RNA Nanotechnology,"Over the last several decades ribonucleic acid (RNA) has been found to carry out a variety of previously unrecognized functions within cellular organisms. These discoveries, in conjunction with the first successful structural determination of natural RNA molecules by X-ray and NMR, have generated an interest in RNA outside the traditional bounds of molecular and cellular biology. The ability to control three-dimensional (3-D) space on the nano-scale as well as the inherent and demonstrated abilities of nucleic acids to self-assemble into predictable and controllable materials has caused RNA to gain acceptance and influence in the interdisciplinary fields of synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and nano-medicine. The following work details the guiding principles associated with the design and characterization of both natural and synthetic RNA while highlighting several newly designed RNA-based scaffolds with potential uses in the diverse fields above as well as the emerging field of RNA nanotechnology, which at its core seeks to design, to construct, and to test RNA nanoparticles that can perform specific cellular or biological functions.",,,
1436,Cellular Strategies for Controlling the Glial Response to Ischemic Injury and Sensitivity Analysis of Stochastic Biochemical Reaction Networks,"This dissertation addresses two topics related to computational systems biology. Part I of the dissertation is motivated by the search for effective treatments for ischemic stroke. Ischemia refers to an inadequate blood supply that initiates a complex set of cellular signaling pathways that ultimately determine whether brain cells survive or die. Microglia --- resident immune cells of the brain --- play an influential role in determining cell fate following stroke. One pathway of particular importance involves activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), which controls the expression of many inflammatory and cell death related genes. A deterministic model is developed to quantitatively describe the feedback-regulated NF-kappaB signaling pathway in microglia, prompted by the inability of previously published models to correctly capture the dynamics observed from experimental data sets from microglia cells. The new model incorporates previously unmodeled dynamics of inhibitor degradation and modified kinetics for upstream kinase activation. Analysis of the model shows parameter sensitivities that strongly depend on the present phase of activation. Analysis further highlights robustness to feedback parameters, analogous to engineered systems. The model is used to analyze potential regulatory mechanisms of heat shock protein 70, known to protect cells against stroke. The second part of the dissertation develops new computational tools for sensitivity analysis of stochastic models of biochemical networks. Sensitivity analysis studies the effects of parameter perturbations on system outputs. This can be used to identify important reactions in complex signaling networks. Sensitivity analysis in stochastic models of biological systems is limited due to high computational costs needed for many Monte Carlo simulations. The development of two new efficient stochastic sensitivity methods that significantly reduce these costs --- the common reaction path method for finite parameter perturbations, and the regularized pathwise derivative method for infinitesimal perturbations --- is presented. Both methods exploit the random time change representation of stochastic models to reduce variance of Monte Carlo estimates. The numerical algorithms presented allow straightforward implementation of the methods. Computational speedups of several orders of magnitude over existing methods are demonstrated for example problems, permitting efficient sensitivity analysis of stochastic biochemical reaction networks.",,,
1438,Types and Cultural Sources of Social Support: The Relationship between Social Support and Mental Health for Mexican-Americans,"Although there have been great strides in acculturation research, social support has not been adequately researched through the lens of acculturation. The available literature indicates that a bicultural acculturation strategy and high levels of social support are associated with beneficial outcomes for both physical and mental health (Berry, 2005; Sarason & Sarason, 2009). Furthermore, social support from both the heritage and host cultures are associated with optimal development for Latin s (Finch & Vega, 2003; Jasinskaja-Lahti et al., 2006). Discrimination, however, can directly affect both well-being and stress (Crockett et al., 2007). To date, the connections between these constructs have been examined generally, but the specific mechanisms throughout which this process occurs have not been fully explored. The present study will investigate the connection between social support, discrimination, well-being, and stress for individuals who endorse a bicultural acculturation strategy. More specifically, it will examine how certain types of support from identified cultural sources influence the positive outcomes that are often associated with the social support literature. A sample of 161 bicultural Mexican-American college students participated in the present study. Results indicated that Mexican/Mexican-American peer emotional and appraisal support had important positive implications for subjective well-being. Mexican/Mexican-American peer emotional support actually moderated the negative effects of discrimination on subjective well-being. European American peer informational support negatively impacted subjective well-being. Understanding how culture influences the connection between social support, well-being, and stress is important for informing prevention programs that can support academic and psychological success. Future directions and implications for bicultural college students are discussed.",,,
1439,Carbon-13 Dynamic Nuclear Polarization at 7 T and 3.7-35 K using a quasi-optical 200 GHZ setup: a study of hyperpolarization dynamics,"Solid state 13C dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments were conducted on a homebuilt 7 T quasi-optical DNP polarizer, on static samples of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and glycerol with 15 mM OX063 trityl radicals. The effects of the addition of Gd-chelate Gd595 and the absence of glycerol on the DNP and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin dynamics are compared and contrasted to draw important conclusions on main DNP contributors. DNP and EPR experiments, at 7 T (197 GHz) and 8.5 T (240 GHz), respectively, were conducted in a dynamic temperature range of 35 K to 3.7 K where the electron thermal polarization changes from 13.4 % to 85.6 %, respectively. Inhomogeneously broadened trityl EPR lines are found and the dominant DNP mechanism is shown to be the cross effect (CE). We have achieved 20 % 13C polarization at 3.7 K and 7 T with a [1-13C]pyruvic/glycerol/H2O sample (p-Mixed) and the effect of 2 mM Gd595 drops the 13C polarization to 11% (p-Gd-Mixed). Only a 6.77% 13C polarization was found with the more highly 13C concentrated pure [1- 13C]pyruvic acid sample (p-Pure). For all samples, EPR linewidths and T1e are heavily temperature dependent in the range 3.7-35 K. T1e values, for all samples, at 8.5 T seem to follow the direct process and are much smaller than what has been reported in literature[1-4] for identical systems at lower magnetic fields. The electron phase memory time (TM) doesn't seem to have much effect on the buildup of nuclear polarization (TDNP) or the DNP enhancement but that the two strongest factors in determining equilibrium DNP enhancements are T1e and T 1n. However, when T1n becomes sufficiently long T1e seems to be dominating the DNP process. The nuclear spin lattice relaxation (T1n) seems to fit well with theory when it is assumed that T 1n relaxation occurs through fixed paramagnetic impurities and is modulated by the electron-electron dipolar reservoir (_TM) as the correlation time of the electronic field that the nuclei ""see"". It is shown that, in some cases, longer T1e values seem to correlate to larger DNP enhancements, but some literature studies contradict this apparent observation. In fact, the Borghini model for low temperature DNP predicts that a shorter T 1e is favorable for higher DNP enhancements. Overall, the Borghini model for low temperature DNP provides a qualitative validation of the main factors that influence DNP enhancement as well as the temperature dependence of DNP enhancements.",,,
1440,Damage Development and Deformation in an Armor Alumina,"The improvement of ceramic armor materials and efficient design of armor structures requires well-validated constitutive laws for dynamic deformation of ceramics. For this purpose, a constitutive model for the response of ceramics was developed by Deshpande and Evans. The objective of this dissertation is to critically evaluate the capabilities of the Deshpande-Evans (DE) model in predicting the response of a typical armor ceramic (notably, a fine-grained alumina). The key deformation processes active during impact are probed via two simplified model problems that highlight different aspects of the material response. Experimental results are compared with numerical simulations utilizing the DE model in order to assess the fidelity of the model predictions. In addition, parameter studies are performed to probe the role of various mechanical properties in the material response during an impact event. Ceramic behavior in the initial stages of impact was probed by: (i) quasistatic indentation, to allow careful instrumentation and the exclusion of dynamic effects, and (ii) confined impact, to incorporate the dynamic aspects of the deformation while preventing spallation and disintegration of the target. Comparisons of the sizes of damage zones obtained experimentally and by finite element (FE) analysis in these tests allowed calibration of the material properties in the DE model. It also provided evidence that the DE model correctly predicts the fracture behavior of the alumina in the initial stages of impact and the granular flow response of the freshly-comminuted material. The fracture toughness and flaw size exert the most significant influence on the simulation results in this regime. Penetration and ceramic deformation during impact were further probed by impact of lightly-constrained monolithic alumina tiles and steel-alumina trilayers. The DE model correctly captures the behavior at low velocities. As the severity of the impact increases, the model fails to capture the localization of deformation in the ceramic and the steel back sheet and under-predicts the maximum displacement of the back sheet. This is attributable to an evolution in the friction angle of the comminuted material during the early stages of granular deformation. A modification to the granular flow law in the DE model to account for this evolution was implemented. It was subsequently used in FE analyses to demonstrate the importance of an evolving friction angle with granular strain on the efficacy of the ceramic in preventing penetration of the structure.",,,
1441,The Effects of Transitional Bilingual Education Versus Structured English Immersion Instructional Models on English Language Development as Measured By the California English Language Development Test,"The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of transitional bilingual education (TBE) and structured English immersion (SEI) instructional models on the development of English language learners (ELLs). Instructional strategies and educational philosophies are always changing. One constant, however, is the achievement gap between ELLs and mainstream students continue to widen. Thus, it is imperative to identify effective instructional programs for educating ELLs, particularly in their English language development. This research adds to current knowledge in regard to effective educational programs for the growing number of ELLs. The elementary school in the study implements both TBE and SEI programs. This study examined English language development between students who have been in the TBE vs. SEI programs consecutively for 4 years, as measured by the California English Language Development Test (CELDT). Students' oral proficiency (listening and speaking) scores were collected in grades K-3 and student's' literacy proficiency (reading and writing) scores were collected in grades 2-3. Using repeated measures MANOVA procedures, the study found that both programs continue to demonstrate growth in all areas of the CELDT in the first 3 years of enrollment in a TBE program; the students scored lower than their SEI peers in their oral proficiency. This may partly be due to the fact that in Kindergarten the students with lower English proficiency were placed into the TBE program, and students with higher English proficiency were placed in the SEI program. Interestingly, the gap between the SEI and TBE students' oral proficiency scores decreased over the first 3 years. In fact, in the last year, the TBE students scored higher than the SEI students in their oral proficiency. As for literacy scores, in grade 2, the SEI students outperformed the TBE students, but in grade 3, the TBE students had a higher average in their literacy scores than the SEI students, although it was not statistically significant for both oral and literacy proficiency.",,,
1442,Outer Space Policy and the Challenge of Governing the Commons,"The purpose of this research was to evaluate the impact of Westphalian ideology in governing common spaces and to explore the potential benefits of establishing a global monitoring regime that both encourages international collaboration and that advocates new systems more effectively and peacefully able to govern outer space and other common spaces. Archival, observation, and interview methods were applied to evaluate current and past United States and international outer space policy. The research acknowledged that the establishment of an outer space governing regime will require the U.S. government to revise its national security interests, and concludes by offering policy implications and solutions using the example of the Antarctic Treaty System, ocean governance, and preventive diplomacy.",,,
1443,The Role of Teachers in Influencing the Development of Adolescents' Possible Selves,"During late childhood and early adolescence, there is a dramatic increase in cognitive skills (Keating, 1980) which influences how young people begin to think about their futures. The construct of possible selves has been used to help understand adolescents' views of their future plans and goals by exploring their social perceptions to gain insight as to how they think about the world and themselves. This study examined the role of perceived teacher support on adolescents' development of possible selves. Results suggest that the four groups (White males, Latinos, White females, and Latinas) in this study think about their future possible selves of graduating from a four year university in different ways. This study provides both important theoretical as wells as practical implications.",,,
1444,The Use of Facile and Efficient Chemistries for Functional Macromolecular Systems,"The field of polymer synthesis has been extensively studied and expanded over several decades to create well-defined functional materials. As more sophisticated materials become increasingly valuable, the demand for tailoring high performance polymers by facile and efficient chemistries is vital to the advancement of the field. This thesis is focused on the incorporation of facile and efficient chemistries for designing and functionalization of high performance materials within few synthetic steps. A facile synthetic strategy has been developed for accessing internally functionalized dendrimers. The key feature of this strategy is the use of two orthogonal and efficient reactions --- `epoxy-amine' and `thiol-ene' --- for the rapid growth of dendrimer scaffolds with functionalizable hydroxyl groups positioned at each dendritic layer. This work primarily demonstrates the practicality, high efficiency, and modular nature of the epoxy-amine reaction for the synthesis of dendrimers and suggests a greater role for this reaction in the preparation of functional macromolecules. With `epoxy-amine' and `thiol-yne' chemistries, trackable multifunctional dendritic scaffolds with high internal loading capacity were designed and synthesized based on a PEG core and an accelerated AB2/CD2 approach. Orthogonal functionalization of chain ends and internal groups allowed the dendritic scaffolds to be both labeled and loaded with releasable dyes. While most artificial adhesives lack adhesion properties under water, marine adhesives stick to nearly all surfaces under water. The presence of catecholic moieties is crucial for the behavior of these systems. Unfortunately, introducing catecholic moieties into artificial synthetic systems is challenging due to their propensity toward oxidation, yielding o-quinone. To overcome these issues, we have utilized two highly efficient and orthogonal reactions: tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB)-catalyzed silylation and `thiol-ene' coupling for the synthesis of new silyl-protected catecholic materials through a facile, cost effective, and simple protecting/deprotecting synthetic process. The novel catecholic moieties were used to functionalize poly(ethyleneoxide) as well as poly(siloxane) based polymers for the facile preparation of biomimetic adhesives, non-covalently cross-linked hydrogels, and anti-biofouling coatings with high lubrication.",,,
1446,"Between Christian and Hindu: Khrist Bhaktas, Catholics, Hindus, and the negotiation of devotion in the Banaras region","This dissertation examines interactions and exchanges between Khrist Bhaktas, Catholics, and Hindus in the Banaras region of eastern Uttar Pradesh, in a study that is ethnographic, historical, and comparative. At the center of the study are the religious adherents known as Khrist Bhaktas, or devotees of Christ. The community, constituted by Dalits and Other Backward Classes (OBCs), are eighty-five percent women and are found mostly in the villages of the Banaras region. Matr&dotbelow; Dham asram (Abode of the Mother) is the movement's geographical locus, situated six kilometers from the Varan&dotbelow;asi Cantonment. Operating under the auspices of the indigenous Catholic Indian Missionary Society (IMS), since the 1970s the asram has been a center of indigenizing Indian Catholicism, and more recently, has served as an influential node in the charismatic Catholic movement in north India, which arrived in Banaras in the early 1990s. It is argued that the Khrist Bhaktas arise out of the historic encounters between Hindus and Christians in South Asia over the last two millennia. As such, their connection to that broader history is examined. It is further argued that the Khrist Bhaktas are most fruitfully interpreted as a hybrid community constituted by the coalescing of Hindu bhakti (devotion), popular or vernacular Hinduism, and charismatic Catholicism. Each of these religious modes are explored in detail, by recourse to religious history, Hindu and Christian scriptures and theology, and social theory. Because the Khrist Bhaktas embody the community's status as ""in-between"" Catholics and Hindus, their examination allows us to interrogate fixed notions of religious identities. For reasons both theological and political, the Khrist Bhaktas have yet to be baptized into full communion with the Catholic Church, thus they remain outside its traditional sacramental life and the so-called ""means of grace."" This has not stopped the communities in question from negotiating other means of encounter with Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and the saints. Negotiation, we find, is the through line for this study, but it is far from certain how or if these negotiations will continue. Four possible futures are envisioned for this emergent religious community.",,,
1447,"Colorblind Empire: International Adoption, Social Policy, and the American Family, 1945--1976","This dissertation explores how the adoption of foreign children from Greece, Korea, and Vietnam to the United States moved beyond an emergency response in the 1940s to become an American institution by the 1970s. The rise of international adoption came as the United States was trying to redefine itself as a nation. The transfer of needy children across ethnic, racial, and national lines promised to bridge the developed and developing world, humanizing relations between countries while reinforcing the United States as an exceptional humanitarian power. This dissertation argues that the institutionalization of intercountry adoptions enabled the United States to extend its political and cultural reach into intimate family relationships beyond its national boundaries. Driven by the demand for new ""markets"" of ""adoptable"" babies, some legislators, adoptive parents, social workers, the private adoption sector, and the media used international adoption as a way to tell a story about their nation as a benevolent power that used its authority to throw off colonial structures of racism and hegemony. In so doing, the United States built a new kind of empire---a ""colorblind empire""---to legitimize foreign children's place in U.S. families. As this dissertation contends, the colorblind empire's logistical success depended on the interaction of state institutions and private agencies. The efforts of private organizations and individuals to promote international adoption succeeded because the federal government expanded immigration policies, limited the regulation of adoption markets, and protected the private sector's policymaking. The advocacy of adoptive parents through political lobbying, interest groups, memoirs, and media campaigns further strengthened the cultural authority and institutional clout of the emerging private international adoption sector. The lens of adoption unites several key themes in twentieth-century American history. Following a foreign orphan's path to the United States changes the trajectories of immigration history and child welfare policy as part of the larger welfare state. It explains how foreign orphans shaped conceptions of racial difference. It alters the image of a homogenous 1950s American family. It reveals how international adoption became the safest kind of nation-building platform, silencing critics that labeled the United States an empire.",,,
1448,Examining the Screening Accuracy of a School Readiness Measure: the Kindergarten Student Entrance Profile (KSEP),"The academic achievement gap has been a challenging problem in the United States for decades. School readiness screening as students enter kindergarten is the first step to identifying students with academic problems, then providing intervention for identified students before they begin to fall behind. In response to the achievement gap problem, the purpose of this study was to help practitioners more accurately identify at-risk students with a school readiness screener at the beginning of their academic careers, thereby intervening early and preventing later school failure. Study 1 examined the screening accuracy of a school readiness screener, the Kindergarten Student Entrance Profile (KSEP), for N = 224 kindergarten students. End of kindergarten reading and math achievement data were also collected, and ROC analyses were used to determine the screening accuracy of the KSEP at various risk levels. Findings indicated that the KSEP was moderately accurate at predicting both reading and math achievement. In addition to examining the screening accuracy of the KSEP alone, ROC analyses were used to determine whether combining the KSEP with a direct assessment (Supplement A) improved screening accuracy. Results from ROC analyses suggested that combining KSEP and Supplement A indeed improved screening accuracy for reading and math achievement. Although the combined measures tended to accurately identify high and low performing students, a significant percentage of students in the middle were still misidentified. Based upon the findings of Study 1, the purpose of Study 2 was to examine the characteristics of misidentified students. The differences in characteristics between misidentified and accurately identified students highlighted whether Supplement A could be modified to more accurately differentiate between at-risk and not at-risk students. Findings indicated that adding items to measure verbal ability and English language proficiency may not improve screening accuracy, but that items that measure behavioral and emotional functioning may help to accurately identify not at-risk students. In sum, this study provides valuable information on the screening accuracy of the KSEP and Supplement A, including information to guide future development. Implications for research and practice are presented, in particular for using the KSEP as part of a multigating assessment framework.",,,
1449,Algorithms for Planar Algebras,"Planar algebras are useful in studying subfactors, representation theory, and knot theory. We focus on taking a skein theoretic, combinatorial approach to developing and describing planar algebras. Evaluating and simplifying closed diagrams is a theme in this dissertation. The jellyfish algorithm is an evaluation algorithm on certain planar algebras defined using generators and relations. Planar algebras defined in this way must be shown to not be the trivial planar algebra. We give a proof that the jellyfish algorithm is well-defined on the D 2n planar algebras using only the presentations. In this dissertation we also present a new planar algebra motivated by the An and Ainfinity graph planar algebras and the notion of coloring diagrams using a graph of colors. We call this planar algebra the Pop-Switch planar algebra and give a full description including an interesting isomorphism between the monoid of the space of closed diagrams and a specific set of sequences of integers.",,,
1450,Geometry of nonnegatively curved smooth metric measure spaces,"In this dissertation we explore smooth metric measure spaces with nonnegative Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor. In particular, we prove a Liouville-type theorem for smooth metric measure spaces (M, g, e-f dvol ) with nonnegative Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor. This generalizes a result of Yau, which is recovered in the case f is constant. This result follows from a gradient estimate for f-harmonic functions on smooth metric measure spaces with Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor bounded from below. We also extend Zhong-Yang's first eigenvalue estimate to smooth metric measure spaces with nonnegative Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor and explore some aspects of a first eigenvalue estimate combining the Zhong-Yang and Lichnerowicz estimates.",,,
1452,Adaptive and Resource-Efficient Rural Area Wireless Networks,"Internet connectivity is an essential factor for human development. Unfortunately, connectivity opportunities differ drastically among regions. While people in urban areas of the developed world enjoy always-on, high-bandwidth connectivity, those residing in rural areas of the developing world often have very slow and intermittent, or no connectivity at all. In this dissertation we propose a holistic approach that aims to improve local and global connectivity of rural, underdeveloped regions. First, we perform an in-depth analysis of the usage of existing technologies in one of the world's most infrastructure-deprived regions --- rural Africa. Our analysis is based on on-site interviews and network traffic analyses from two sub-Saharan villages. Our findings show that the current technology does not successfully tackle unique challenges of rural area networking, such as the need to cover vast underpopulated areas, and operate with low energy resources. In addition, we find that the specific ways the Internet is used in rural areas calls for re-engineering of online applications so that they are made appropriate to the needs of the local population. The analysis results serve as guidelines for developing novel networking solutions for rural regions. To cover vast under-populated areas we propose long-range wireless networks operating in the white space spectrum. For this spectrum we develop PowerRate and WhiteRate, rate adaptation protocols geared towards optimal utilization of limited energy and spectrum resources, and support for critical voice and video, applications. For white space network organization we propose VillageLink, a protocol for channel allocation in a multiuser system. To reduce unnecessary communication delay, symptomatic for rural networks, we propose a suite of network traffic localization techniques: VillageCell, a low-cost, low-power, community-owned cell phone infrastructure, and VillageShare, a network traffic localization system that facilitates file sharing within a community. We also develop a novel distributed online social network architecture which harnesses locality of interactions to improve user experience and preserve bandwidth in remote regions. Finally, we strive to go beyond pilots, and, through collaborative work with local stakeholders and researchers, create solutions that will become integral parts of everyday life in rural areas.",,,
1453,Mining and Modeling of Large and Time-Evolving Graphs,"Vast amounts of data are generated each day from applications such as social networks, biological pathways, email graphs, and the word-wide web. This data represents an amazing opportunity for the discovery of interesting, useful, and possibly even life saving new knowledge. Additionally, since the node and edge structures of graph representations can naturally capture the organization and interactions present in many types of data, they are commonly used to represent a wide variety of complex datasets. The analysis, mining, and modeling of these graph datasets have inspired numerous highly active areas of research. This has led to many important applications, including the discovery of new gene and protein functions, anomaly detection in computer networks, and the extraction of significant and influential social groups. However, while there has been much focus on the mining and modeling of graphs in recent years, the vast majority of previous research has dealt with simple, static graph representations. Despite this focus on simple, static graphs, most real world graphs are large-scale, dynamic, and heterogeneous. Their nodes and edges can grow from the thousands to the billions, as well as change across time and have additional information (such as labels, text, weights, images, etc.) associated with them. By disregarding these real-world graph properties, a valuable source of important knowledge and applications is ignored. In this dissertation, I focus on the mining and modeling of these large-scale, heterogeneous, and time evolving graphs. I introduce several new techniques capable of mining clusters from graphs with greater precision and speed, as well as multiple new dynamic graph modeling algorithms capable of predicting future graph structure and properties such as user communication and sentiment across time.",,,
1454,Highly-Strained P-type Modulation Doped Active Regions for High-Speed VCSELs,"In the age of ubiquitous computing, we are never far from the data we need and even the ones we don't. To support this constant stream of information, large central facilities called data centers are used to process, route and store the data before it beaming it to your favorite device. The bottleneck for these sprawling data centers lie in the movement of data from one point to another and at increasingly higher speeds. The traditional network of copper wires is currently at odds with growth trends because they must be shortened to achieve the necessary higher speeds while data centers are only getting larger. A far more promising solution is to transmit data through fiber optical cables using high-speed vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) which can operate at higher speeds, use less energy, and can be built at low-cost. In this dissertation I demonstrate for the first time, the simultaneous use of p-type modulation doping in highly-strained 1060 nm QW VCSELs to simultaneously achieve high differential gain and low damping which increases the intrinsic bandwidth from 23 to 43 GHz. Additionally, the separate confinement heterostructure (SCH) surrounding the active region is adjusted to decrease the accumulation of carriers through the growth of graded heteorjunctions which ultimately reduces electrical parasitics. Optimized growth techniques for low resistance p-DBR mirrors are also shown as a means to reduce parasitics. I will also demonstrate a method for extending the single mode operating current range by scaling down device size to induce mode-selective loss. With these enhancements the VCSELs presented here are able to achieve 25 Gbps operation which is faster than the current 10 Gbps standard. Moreover, these lasers required only 400 fJ/bit at this data rate which is far below the commonly accepted 1 pJ/bit optical interconnects feasibility target.",,,
1455,Turbulent Rayleigh-Benard Convection of Low Prandtl-Number Gases,"Experimental results are presented for heat transport and flow dynamics in turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection using pressurized gases with Prandtl numbers around 0.7 and gas mixtures with Prandtl numbers between approximately 0.17 and 0.7, in two different sized apparatuses. The large apparatus had a cell of height 0.5 m and diameter 0.25 m, and reached a maximum Rayleigh number of about 1013. The small apparatus had a cell of height 0.93 cm and diameter 10 cm, and reached a maximum Rayleigh number of about 108. The heat transport in the large apparatus, after applying corrections for the wall current and an asymmetry in the top and bottom thermal boundary layers, showed reasonable agreement with other recent experimental and computational results, and relatively poor agreement with the Grossmann-Lohse (GL) model. There was no evidence of a transition to a new regime at a Rayleigh number around 1011, as had been reported by an earlier group. A large-scale circulation in the bulk fluid was also observed for all Rayleigh numbers studied. In the small apparatus, the heat transport of the pure gases agreed moderately well with the GL model. The gas mixtures showed an enhanced heat transport, as expected from the coupling between temperature gradients and concentration gradients. A boundary-layer model to predict the heat transport enhancement showed qualitative agreement with the measured results, but predicted a smaller magnitude of enhancement than was observed. A shadowgraph optical apparatus provided flow visualization from the top of the small apparatus. The Reynolds number of the flow was measured from these images using the Elliptic Approximation, and agreed well with the GL model prediction. Spatial power spectra of the shadowgraph images showed peaks at small wavelengths which decreased with increasing Rayleigh number. Only at the highest observed Rayleigh numbers were large-scale structures comparable in size to the height of the cell observed.",,,
1456,Staged Identity: Martinican and Guadeloupian Theatre,"This work delineates the unique role theatre plays in the establishment of Martinican and Guadeloupian cultural and national identity independent from (although integrated with) the dominant French culture of their former colonizers. As French overseas departments, both Martinique's and Guadeloupe's public school system has been imported from France and thus imposes an alienating French emphasis on West Indian consciousness and identity. Yet theatre offers a new place for cultural education because it can instill pride, consciousness and identity in a localized form particular to Martinique and Guadeloupe. This important educational function is especially notable in the plays analyzed here, which are virtually absent from the critical literature on the French Caribbean, yet clearly merit a closer look. I examine a corpus of over twenty French West Indian plays. I consider these plays as cultural manifestations of what Martinicans and Guadeloupians value and disparage. I look at this theatre also as a national theatre wherein a narrative of the nation is fabricated and affirmed publically. I study Martinicans and Guadeloupians through their theatrical cultural manifestations which themselves focus on historical and contemporary events. Thus my analysis contributes cultural and historical depth to the rapidly evolving field of French Caribbean theatre criticism. My dissertation examines works, 1960-present, by Aime Cesaire, Edouard Glissant, Daniel Boukman, Ina Cesaire, Rene Louise and Patrick Chamoiseau, to name a few. One can discern in these works an independent cultural identity, which can be illuminated by the lens of ""auto-ethnography."" This term refers to Glissant and Chamoiseau's interest in studying and transcribing their own cultures with both the critical eye of an outside observer and the deep understanding of a native informant. Although the other authors did not self-identify as auto-ethnographers, I argue that one can apply this concept more broadly. The early 1960s were a crucial time when many colonies were fighting for and gaining independence. Although not directly engaged in anti-colonial struggles, Martinicans and Gaudeloupians nevertheless participated in independence movements and theatre was a significant arena for articulating these issues. Prior to this moment, imitation and reproduction of French theatre, culture, and society reigned; from the 1960s onward, playwrights focused on the expression and resuscitation of local history and culture. To facilitate this expression, many writers turned toward popular movements such as Negritude, Antillanite, and Creolite, enabling a cultural education and affirming an identity particular to both Martinique and Guadeloupe.",,,
1457,Spectral Methods for Analyzing Biological Polymers,"We develop a novel suite of image processing and statistical tools to better understand the elasticity of biopolymers in vitro. The principles of thermodynamics predict a relationship between the distribution of a biopolymer's shape configurations at thermal equilibrium over time and its stiffness. This provides a method for observing fluorescence microscopy data of thermally fluctuating biopolymers and analytically deriving their elastic properties. However, for stiff biopolymers, such as microtubules, it is difficult to distinguish between physical heterogeneity and experimental noise. We improve on preexisting methods by developing a more robust image processing method to study the shape configurations, and an advanced statistical method of deriving their elastic properties. To validate our algorithms, we benchmark it against numerically generated datasets with generated noise features mimicking those found in experiment. This allows scientists to analyze experimental data with an understand how image noise affects calculations. Lastly, we develop methods that generalize standard theories to include detecting heterogeneities in elasticity and compare our methods with both numerical and experimental datasets.",,,
1458,Three Papers in Labor Economics,The following is a compilation of three papers written within the general area of Labor Economics. The first paper is an empirical examination of the effects of minimum wage increases on the earnings and mobility choices of U.S. immigrants. The second paper studies the impact of fluctuations in unemployment rates before high school graduation on lifetime educational attainment. The third paper tracks the widening and narrowing of the gap in educational attainment between U.S. immigrants and those born in the U.S. from 1980 to 2009.,,,
1459,Bridging Social and Semantic Computing -- Design and Evaluation of User Interfaces for Hybrid Systems,"The evolution of the Web brought new interesting problems to computer scientists that we loosely classify in the fields of social and semantic computing. Social computing is related to two major paradigms: computations carried out by a large amount of people in a collective intelligence fashion (i.e. wikis), and performing computations on social networks (i.e. social network analysis). On the other hand, semantic computing focuses on assigning meaning to data and enabling computers to process and integrate it (i.e. natural language processing, data mining, etc.). This dissertation delves into the intersection of social and semantic computing. We present new hybrid techniques showing how the two domains benefit each other or are used together to produce better content. These synergistic techniques introduce an extra level of complexity that can be alleviated by the use of interfaces. User interfaces not only increase the transparency and explanation in systems where social and semantic computing are used together, but also serve as input modalities that additionally boost the quality of the content produced by the hybrid techniques. We exemplify our contributions with three case studies of novel user interfaces that utilize social and semantic computing.",,,
1460,Religion and Humor,"This thesis explores the relationship between religion and humor by focusing on four common ways in which religious individuals and communities use humor: as a teaching tool to instruct adherents in the ideas, norms, or values of the tradition; as a sign of transcendence to indicate the presence of sacred or extraordinary qualities in divine beings or holy people; as a release valve to relieve pent-up tension through the regulated expression of otherwise prohibited ideas, images or behaviors; and as a weapon to both defend and attack one's own religious tradition and to negotiate the place of religious traditions in broader social contexts.",,,
1461,Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR1) Modulation of the Host Response to Measles Virus Infection,"Interferon (IFN) is a cytokine, inducible by virus infection, that regulates the expression of IFN-stimulated genes including two double-stranded RNA-dependent enzymes: the protein kinase PKR, that mediates inhibition of host protein translation; and the adenosine deaminase ADAR1, that catalyzes deamination of RNA substrates. The roles ADAR1 and PKR in host responses to measles virus (MV) infection were investigated, including IFN-beta induction and stress granule formation. Human HeLa cells deficient in ADAR1 or PKR expression were used together with the Moraten vaccine strain of MV and two isogenic mutants derived from this strain lacking either V or C accessory proteins that alter innate host responses. Our laboratory previously demonstrated that, during MV infection, PKR is proapoptotic and is required for maximal IFN-beta transcription. In contrast, ADAR1 is antiapoptotic, suppresses PKR activation and enhances MV growth. However, the involvement of ADAR1 in IFN-beta mRNA induction was not known. Furthermore, whether MV induced stress granules and the roles PKR and ADAR1 in this process likewise were not known. The results presented in the first part of this dissertation demonstrate that ADAR1 suppressed IFN-beta mRNA induction by impairment of PKR activation and of IFN-beta transcription factors ATF2, NF-kappaB and IRF3. Additionally, levels of IFN-beta protein production were determined and correlated inversely with PKR activation. The second part of this dissertation describes results pertaining to MV-induced stress granules, inducible aggregates of stalled ribosomes, mRNA and RNA binding proteins, that are hypothesized to regulate host translation patterns and virus replication. I found that stress granule formation required PKR and was impaired by ADAR1 and the MV C protein. Finally, to shed light on the mechanism of ADAR1 regulation of host responses to MV infection that include SG formation, PKR activation, IFN-beta mRNA induction and enhancement of virus growth, ADAR1-deficient cells were complemented with wildtype and mutant ADAR1 expression plasmids and then tested for functional innate responses following infection. Deaminase activity of ADAR1 was required to modulate these host responses to infection. This work supports the notion that ADAR1 and PKR play opposing roles in the host response to MV infection: PKR is antiviral and ADAR1, remarkably, is proviral despite its IFN inducibility.",,,
1462,"California Teacher Retirement: Perception, Satisfaction, and Change","Concerns over fiscal and personal appropriateness for public retirement pensions have become prevalent within conversations throughout the United States. However, with some important exceptions (e.g., DeArmond and Goldhaber, 2010) limited research has focused upon perceptions of teachers who receive these pension plans. As such, the purpose of this study was to describe and analyze the degree to which teachers' perceptions of their understanding of retirement, sufficiency of retirement, and preference for defined benefit may contribute to retirement satisfaction, career satisfaction, and openness to changing the retirement system. A survey design was used to gather data from teachers in three California districts. Nearly 230 teachers submitted usable surveys. Factor analyses were used to confirm both independent and dependent variables of study. Four factors emerged related to independent variables: understanding of retirement, sufficiency of retirement, preference for defined benefit, and preference for personal retirement control. Five factors emerged related to dependent variables: retirement satisfaction, personal career satisfaction, compensation satisfaction, openness to major system change, and openness to strengthening the retirement system. Among the findings were that teachers' perceptions of understanding of retirement, sufficiency of retirement, and preference for personal retirement control were all significant predictors of retirement satisfaction. Furthermore, perceptions of sufficiency of retirement were a significant predictor of compensation satisfaction. Preference for defined benefit and preference for personal retirement control were both significant predictors for openness to major system change. This finding indicated that teachers' preference for defined benefit had a negative predictive effect on openness to major system change. In addition, those preferring personal retirement control had a positive effect on openness to major system change. Analyzing teachers by experience showed that teachers with high experience (more than 15 years) had a higher satisfaction of retirement, understanding of retirement, and preference for defined benefit than less experienced teachers. Contrastingly, lower experience teachers had a higher openness to major system change and a higher preference for personal retirement control. These differences suggest that experienced teachers are generally more satisfied and content with their retirement but newer teachers are likely more open to potential system overhauls being considered within the state studied.",,,
1463,Crafting Intergroup Apology: A matched emotion strategy,"Three studies investigated the effect of apology on intergroup relations outcomes. Study 1 demonstrated that apology can shape intergroup forgiveness and retribution, and that it does so via changes in specific intergroup emotions felt by members of the apology recipient group (i.e. the anger and respect students felt towards faculty members). Studies 2 and 3 were designed to evaluate the role of appraisals in this process, and to determine whether specific apology components can be effective in modulating specific suites of appraisals, emotions, and intergroup relations outcomes. In order to generate differing profiles of anger and fear, I manipulated the emotions felt in response to an intergroup transgression in Study 2 (via the emotional consequence of the transgression itself) and Study 3 (via the emotional response of fellow ingroup members). There was no evidence for a unique effect of different apology components in these studies. However, the results provide some support for the proposed model of intergroup apology, in which apology is a special type of intergroup event capable of updating post-transgression appraisals, emotions, and intergroup relations outcomes.",,,
1464,Novela y teatro en la Espana barroca. Cuatro dramatizaciones de novelas cervantinas,"This dissertation focuses on four comedias based on four of the most famous of Cervantes's novellas. I examine Guillen de Castro's El curioso impertinente (1606), Antonio de Solis's La gitanilla de Madrid (1671), Antonio de Coello's El celoso extremeno (1634 ) and La ilustre fregona y el amante al uso (1641), adscribed to Lope de Vega. Using a methodology based on intertext, I analyze the multiple changes, which occurred through the dramatization of these novellas. Particular emphasis is placed on the conventions of drama as a performing art as well as on the ideological roles commonly attributed to 17th century Spanish theatre. In contrast to the plays inspired by them, Cervantes's novellas present a critical component as they put into question the behavior of the ruling elites and condemn their complacent self-image. I argue that the plays, in turn, tend to be overtly conservative in their support of the status quo represented by the King, the nobility, and the Catholic Church. This dissertation is comprised of four main chapters, each one centered on a different comedia. In La ilustre fregona (The Ilustrous Kitchen Maid) and La gitanila de Madrid (The Little Gypsy of Madrid) Cervantes intermixes realistic and idealized scenes; by doing so he undermines the traditional conventions of the romance genre, whereas the comedias produce a more homogenous effect through the suppression of socially disruptive elements. The last two chapters concentrate on two stage adaptations of ""El curioso impertinente"" (""The Curious-Impertinent""), a short story inserted in Don Quijote, Part 1, and El celoso extremeno (The Jealeous Extremaduran). In both novellas the depiction of extreme cases of marital jealousy leads to a deep scrutiny of issues concerning female autonomy, free will, and human responsibility, which are almost obliterated in the comedias. By emphasizing instead the transcendental action of the Divine Providence and offering a predictable outcome, these dramatic versions sacrifice the complexity of Cervantes's moral vision---here replaced by theatrical plot devices adjusted to the tastes and beliefs of the audience.",,,
1465,Specialized mechanisms for theory of mind: Evidence for a co-option theory,"Human social interaction critically depends on theory of mind, the ability to reason about behavior in terms of mental states. The goal of the current research program is to assess what kinds of special-purpose neurocognitive mechanisms support theory of mind. Three theories are considered. The first theory proposes that mechanisms are specialized not for theory of mind in particular but more generally for metarepresentation, the ability to reason about representations, including mental (e.g., belief, desire, and intention) and non-mental representations (e.g., maps, signs, and notes). The second theory proposes that mechanisms are specialized for theory of mind, selectively processing mental states and leaving the processing of non-mental representations to other mechanisms. The third theory proposes that mechanisms are specialized for theory of mind, but are co-opted to process non-mental representations owing to non-mental representations sufficiently resembling mental states, allowing them to also activate the theory of mind system. A fundamental distinction between the proper and actual domain of a specialized mechanism reveals how the three theories are related. The proper domain refers to the inputs a mechanism is designed to process; the actual domain refers to the inputs a mechanism is capable of processing (Sperber, 1994). The first theory proposes the mental and non-mental representations belong to the proper domain of a single mechanism. The second theory proposes that mental states belong to the proper domain of one mechanism and that non-mental representations belong to the proper domain of a distinct mechanism. The third ""co-option"" theory claims that mental states constitute the proper domain of a theory of mind mechanism but that non-mental representations, because they are also capable of triggering the system, belong to the actual domain of that same mechanism. The following chapters explore the extent of domain-specificity for mechanisms underlying theory of mind along the proper and actual domain dimensions. Chapter 1 sets the stage for the subsequent chapters, reviewing some preliminaries, highlighting the importance of theory of mind, and providing theoretical background. Chapter 2 presents four reaction time experiments that compared reasoning about beliefs to maps, signs, and notes (under two conditions), testing the scope of the proper domain for mechanisms governing theory of mind. Chapter 3 presents two reaction time priming experiments and one repetition suppression fMRI study assessing the scope of the actual domain of mechanisms supporting theory of mind specializations. Finally, Chapter 4 summarizes the findings, weighs them against the theories under consideration, and considers several outstanding issues.",,,
1466,Adaptive Multiscale Algorithms and Software for Stochastic Simulation of Biochemical Systems,"Traditional differential equation models of biochemical systems are useful when the interacting chemical species are present in high concentrations. However, many processes in biology are driven by reactions between chemicals with small copy numbers. These processes are inherently stochastic and display behavior that cannot be captured by deterministic models. Michealis-Menten kinetics are commonly used to represent enzyme-catalyzed reactions in biochemical models. The Michaelis-Menten approximation has been thoroughly studied in the context of differential equation models. It is shown that the Michaelis-Menten approximation is applicable in discrete stochastic models and the validity conditions are the same as in the deterministic regime. We also compare the Michaelis-Menten approximation to a procedure known as the slow-scale stochastic simulation algorithm (ssSSA). Differences are examined with a strong focus on simulation efficiency, and some special cases of the stochastic formulas are confirmed using a first-passage time analysis. Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) has become an invaluable tool for simulating biochemical models in a way that captures this randomness. The multiscale nature of many biological processes leads the SSA to be inefficient for many realistic problems. The ssSSA was proposed an as efficient approximate SSA method to simulate models exhibiting fast reactions in stochastic partial equilibrium. However, the ssSSA is not easy to use, as one needs to identify the fast reactions and then efficiently take them to partial equilibrium. Techniques are presented for automating the ssSSA. A strategy to automatically partition the system into fast and slow reaction subsets is proposed. A general-purpose method to estimate the equilibrium mean populations of the fast process is also provided, along with optimizations that make the performance competitive with existing model-specific approaches. Implementation details are discussed and the effectiveness of the method is demonstrated for three example models. We present StochKit2, a software package that allows practicing scientists to perform stochastic simulations of biochemical models. StochKit2 provides highly efficient implementations of several variants of the SSA, and tau-leaping with automatic step size selection. StochKit2 features include automatic selection of the optimal SSA method, event handling, and automatic parallelism on multicore architectures. StochKit2 is freely available as open source software.",,,
1468,Dileptons and jets at the LHC: the search for lepto-gluons and supersymmetry,"The thesis presents the results from two searches using dileptons and jets based on 4.98 fb-1 of data taken by the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider during the 2011 run. The first is part of a larger, complete search for supersymmetry using the signal of one isolated lepton, jets and missing transverse energy. Although the search concentrates on a single lepton topology, this thesis outlines the procedure to predict the contribution from dilepton events which, through various processes, feed down into the single lepton control sample. The second is a search for massive, exotic, colored fermions decaying to two jets and a lepton by looking for a peak in the lepton plus two jet invariant mass spectrum. A data-driven method has been developed in order to make a background prediction. The observations are consistent with the standard model background prediction. The results are presented as limits on the cross section of such exotic fermions as a function of mass.",,,
1469,Ocean acidification in nearshore marine ecosystems: Natural dynamics of ocean pH variation and impacts on sea urchin larvae,"Ocean acidification (OA) is expected to have a major effect on the marine carbonate system and predicting the response of marine ecosystems is a central objective for management and protection of marine communities. While many experimental studies have explored the impact of OA on the physiological performance of marine calcifiers by using future predicted atmospheric CO2 levels to parameterize laboratory experiments, less appreciated is the natural environmental variation within these systems, particularly in terms of pH. This natural variation may inform laboratory experiments and improve our ability to predict responses to a changing ocean climate. The central objective of this dissertation is to use an interdisciplinary approach to examine how marine larvae living in coastal regions may be impacted by future ocean acidification. This is accomplished using two distinct approaches: (1) organismal-level culturing experiments to test the thresholds of physiological response in larvae to altered seawater chemistry and (2) oceanographic observations of pH variation and water mass properties to identify ecosystem-specific patterns of natural variation. Biochemical, morphometric, and gene expression-based tools were used to examine how early life history stages of two sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and S. droebachiensis) respond to elevated pCO2 conditions. These results suggest that developing larvae may either prioritize endogenous energy towards development and physiological function at the expense of growth, or that reduced larval length may be strictly due to higher costs of growth under OA conditions. In addition, the magnitude of physiological responses, as quantified by gene expression, may be influenced by the parental adult habitat. Recent advances in pH sensor technology allowed our first glimpses at high-frequency pH variation in nearshore ecosystems and the ability to identify potential drivers of natural variation. Mooring-based observations in McMurdo Sound indicate that this ecosystem experiences low levels of diel pH variation (< 0.1 units) during austral Spring. Relatively greater pH variation was observed at shallow coastal sites as opposed to those in deeper water. This variation is likely not driven by water mass mixing, but may be due to photosynthesis by under ice algae in shallow coastal sites.",,,
1470,Pedagogy and Practice: Providing Opportunities for Students to Develop Criticality in an Undergraduate Black Studies Course,"A growing number of researchers claim that diverse students with potentially diverse literacies are unable to take up the necessary literate practices to be successful in the university and upon leaving they are unable to master these literate practices, specifically the need to address critical thinking, problem-solving, and writing and to develop methods for assessing said skills. Yet, there has been little empirical research conducted to examine what counts as a general education course within the institutional frame and the purposes it serves institutionally and for the professor. This study examines a Research One University general education Black Studies History of Jazz course that meets writing, ethnicity, and art requirements, using ethnographically grounded discourse analysis to understand what faculty face when teaching general education courses for diverse students. Further, with the impact of globalization and new technologies, bringing more diverse people together, it has become more difficult to engage students in the process of questioning and problematizing issues of cross-cultural understanding in our global society, processes that are a goal of many general education diversity courses. This dissertation was designed to address the current conflicts facing twenty-first century students with diverse ethnicities, diverse literacies, diverse educational backgrounds, and experiences as they engage with the curriculum, focusing on critical thinking or ""criticality"" as proposed by the instructor of a general education diversity course. Specifically, by having race as a topic, it can be an affordance for ""criticality"", and in turn, ""criticality"" as a mode of thinking can be an affordance of studying issues of diversity. Through this process, students engage in ""performing criticality"" for the purpose of achieving the state of ""embodied criticality"" or ""knowledge production"". Thus, this dissertation seeks to provide empirical research that can be used to support initiatives that seek to reframe general education courses to best serve the needs of diverse students entering colleges and universities with diverse literacies in order to prepare them to live and work well in a global society.",,,
1471,When is an English Language Learner Not An English Language Learner? Exploring Individual Differences in Developmental Language and Literacy Acquisition for At-Risk Learners: A Latent Transition Approach,"Empirical evidence suggests oral language proficiency is correlated with literacy outcomes; however, the relationship between oral language proficiency and literacy outcomes for English Language Learners is highly variable. As a result, the field lacks critical direction to identify children who are English Language Learners experiencing general reading difficulties or difficulty due to underlying reading disabilities. These inconsistent results may be due to the fact that published studies treat English Language Learner participants as a homogenous group. As a result, the purpose of this study was to identify unobserved heterogeneity in language acquisition for children who are Spanish-speaking English Language Learners. Latent Transition Analysis was used to model meaningful patterns of acquisition in bilingual oral language proficiency. Spanish-speaking children (N = 500) in the 1st, 2nd , and 3rd grade during Year 1 (2009-2010) were tested during the Fall of each school year, for a total of three assessment waves from 2009-2012. The extended bilingual (English/Spanish) assessment battery tested language, reading, and cognition abilities on both norm-referenced and experimental measures. All testing was counterbalanced for language presentation and test order during each assessment wave. Examination of fit statistics combined with substantive theory suggested four meaningful classes of bilingual oral language proficiency emerged and remained consistent across time points. Further examination of the transitional probabilities indicated overwhelming stability for language acquisition; however, instances of developmental progress did emerge. Adding time-varying covariates of phonological processing abilities in English did not significantly change the 4-class solutions derived at each time point. Estimated means predicting distal reading comprehension outcomes from year 2 class standing suggest children's class standing was a significant predictor of reading comprehension abilities in English. Overall, findings provide unique contributions to shape educational policy, classroom practices, and the field of research for English Language Learners.",,,
1472,Group Actions on Spaces with Surface Quotients,"We define an object called a G-struture, and use it to classify disconnected regular covering spaces of a base space in terms of group actions. We then apply this result to classify discrete group actions on singular surfaces whose quotient space is homeomorphic to an oriented closed surface. We also investigate the converse question: given an oriented closed surface with a set of singular points on it marked by stabilizer information, when does this result from a group action? For a large class of stabilizer data we have exact answers based the theory of orbifolds.",,,
1473,Synthesis and Characterization of Environmentally Responsive Lipid-Nucleic Acid Complexes for Applications in Gene Delivery and Biomaterials,"Environmentally responsive materials, i.e., materials that are designed to react to changes in their environment with a modification in their properties or structure, draw growing interests especially for synthetic materials for gene therapy and biomaterials applications. In this work, environmentally responsive lipid materials are designed to be responsive to (i) reducing milieu of the cytoplasm and (ii) low pH of late endosome. (i) The cleavable multivalent lipids (CMVLs) are designed with a disulfide bond in the linker between cationic headgroup and hydrophobic tails. CMVLs are designed to show the effect of lipid-nucleic acid complexes degradation in cytoplasm on nucleic acid delivery and cytotoxicity (ii) An acid-labile PEG-lipid (HPEG2K-lipid) capable of losing PEG chains at the pH of late endosomes is tailored for optimum circulation lifetime of liposomes as well as efficient endosomal release. Here, the efficient synthesis is presented as well as extensive characterization of the series of tailored cleavable multivalent lipids (CMVLn, with n = 2 to 5 the number of positive headgroup charges at full protonation). The self-assembled complexes of the CMVLs and DNA are a prototypical environmentally responsive material, undergoing extensive structural rearrangement when exposed to reducing agents. CMVL-DNA complexes are employed as carriers for nucleic acids in DNA transfection as well as small interfering RNA silencing experiments. The employment of CMVLs in complexes with nucleic acids presents the effect of CMVLs degradation on cytotoxicity, DNA transfection as well as siRNA silencing efficiency. The investigation of structural evolution of CMVL-DNA complexes at varied complex composition, temperature and incubation time was assessed employing small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS).",,,
1474,Rebalancing Portfolios under Transaction Costs,"In this thesis we study the performance of a re-balanced portfolio strategy relative to the market portfolio in the presence of transaction costs. The strategy involves re-balancing to fixed weights at regular time steps. We consider an equity market with m Stocks. Our goal is to compare the asymptotic growth rate of such strategies to the market. With the application of an Ergodic theorem, we show that the problem can be transformed to computing the expectation of a functional of the market weights of the stocks. Expressing the gain in the re-balanced portfolio over the market portfolio as a functional of the market weights, we derive the condition under which the growth rate of the rebalanced strategy beats that of the market portfolio. We also show a method to compute the maximum transaction cost that can be paid in order for the rebalanced portfolio to beat the market portfolio. We discuss the result in the context of the Volatility-Stabilized model and the Geometric Brownian Motion model. In the second part of the thesis, we define the optimal re-balancing portfolio that maximizes the growth rate within the class of such fixed weight re-balancing strategies. We study the relationship of the optimum portfolio and optimal growth rate to the re-balancing time step and transaction cost coefficient. Finally, we look at the performance of such re-balancing strategies on real data sets obtained from Yahoo Finance. The study indicates that for small trading time steps, the re-balancing strategy under performs compared to the market in the presence of transaction costs.",,,
1475,The Multiracial Reference Group Orientation Scale (MRGOS): A New Scale for Use with Mixed Race Populations,"Extensive theoretical and empirical research on the subject of racial/ethnic identity among multiracial (i.e. ""mixed race"") populations has yielded several models that either explain the development of racial/ethnic identity or present reference group typologies or patterns for multiracial people. Unfortunately, most models have been developed from small samples with particular blended combinations (e.g. Black/White, Japanese/White) and have not been tested on larger, more diverse samples. In other words, the efforts to develop mixed race identity models have not been matched with subsequent efforts to develop racial/ethnic identity scales. The creation and validation of a multiracial identity scale is an important contribution to critical mixed race studies to facilitate systematic findings on identity for multiracial individuals of various combinations. This dissertation will focus on the initial development of the Multiracial Reference Group Orientation Scale (MRGOS). The MRGOS was originally designed to measure four reference group orientations found in empirical research among multiracial populations: single RGO (orientation toward one parent ethnic group), multigroup RGO (orientation toward multiple parent ethnic groups), mixed race RGO (orientation toward other mixed race people as a group), and postracial RGO (nonidentification with parent ethnic groups and rejection of racial categorization). The MRGOS has been developed using an online survey targeting mixed race undergraduates at several four-year colleges and universities in California. Exploratory factor analysis and reliability analysis yielded a six-factor scale. Five of the factors conformed to the RGOs proposed in the model, including two postracial factors, though one non-RGO factor (Exploration) was also extracted from the original list of items. Adequate internal consistency was found for all of the RGO subscales except for the second postracial subscale. Partial support was found for the known groups validity of the mixed race, single, and one of the postracial subscales. Steps for the further development of the scale and the broader implications of the scale for research on race and ethnicity are discussed.",,,
1476,Examining Online Forum Discussions as Practices of Digital Literacy in College-Level ESL Writing,"This research study examines the role of digital media, more specifically online forums, in the development of academic literacy and language learning in English as a Second Language (ESL) college writing. Studies in Second Language Acquisition suggest that participation in online forum discussions can potentially foster collaboration, self-expression, and active involvement, affording students with a learning environment that encourages critical thinking and problem-solving. Accordingly, online forum discussions used as educational environments can also become a powerful vehicle to support academic literacy development. In this context, this research study aims to provide a careful analysis of student participation in digital practices of literacy engaged through online forums in a college-level ESL class in order to understand what ESL students accomplish discursively when expressing and disputing opinions in an online forum discussion. Analysis will include: 1) detailed descriptive analysis of online forum discussions as forms of engagement in practices of digital literacy, with particular attention to the differences between online forum discussions as ""everyday practices,"" engaged outside of school settings, and online forum discussions as ""pedagogical practice,"" engaged in a college-level ESL writing class; 2) careful examination of the discourse of the contributions ESL students wrote in online forums with particular attention to viewing ESL students as multilingual individuals, creating language through expressing and disputing opinions in online forum discussions; 3) thoughtful consideration of the relationship between writing in online forum discussions and writing academic persuasive essays. As a consequence of this study, pedagogical uses and implications for teaching with digital literacies will also be investigated through critical examination of the design and application of online forum discussions in language learning and literacy educational practices.",,,
1477,Gas Circulation in Major Mergers of Gas Rich Galaxies,"We have mapped the kinematic and physical properties of gas emitting optical emission lines across 39 gas-rich mergers, some of which we have shown to host tidally-induced gas inflows, with deep ESI spectroscopy. In our unique analysis of these longslit spectra, we fitted multiple kinematic components to forbidden lines and recombination lines simultaneously, enabling an examination of the excitation mechanism in different kinematic components. We identify many rotating gas disks in systems whose stellar component is no longer a disk due to the merger. Many of these disks present gas excited by hot stars, but some of the disks present shock-like ratios of diagnostic emission lines, an observation we attribute to the collision of the two galaxies. In another subset of galaxies, we find very broad (sigma > 150 km/s) emission components that also present shock-like emission-line ratios. The large spatial extent of this emission favors shocks over the narrow-line region of a hidden AGN as the excitation mechanism. The high star formation rate, high dust content, and blueshift of the broad emission further suggest an origin in a galactic outflow. If this interpretation is correct, then our study of these nearby galaxies provides important insight for interpreting the broad emission lines associated with giant star-forming clumps in z~2 galaxies. It also shows that galactic outflows can be recognized via resolved emission lines, in addition to absorption lines, even in integrated spectra; and this technique could prove very powerful for studying galactic outflows in infrared spectra of high-redshift galaxies in the future.",,,
1478,Morphology Prediction and Manipulation of Real-Complexity Organic Molecular Crystals,"Crystal morphology is known to significantly influence the end-use efficacy of solid products generating immense interest in the ability to predict and engineer crystal morphology. We make efforts to improve upon classical mechanistic models of crystal shape to develop understanding and quantitative platforms to engineer crystal morphology for specific applications. The classical Burton, Cabrera and Frank spiral growth model for crystal growth fails to work satisfactorily for many real systems such as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), non-linear optical compounds, etc., due to the inherent assumption of a simple Kossel crystal structure in the model, which essentially means dealing with symmetric systems experiencing isotropic conditions on all faces. The development of a more general mechanistic spiral growth model that is not just limited to the traditional centric systems but enables morphology prediction for all kinds of organic molecular crystals is outlined and validated for many important real systems. The first three chapters describe the classical methodology and the development and demonstration of the new spiral growth model for non-centrosymmetric growth units. Foreign molecules such as additives or impurities may influence the crystal morphology to a significant extent by inhibiting the growth mechanism of certain crystal faces. A generic probabilistic scheme for quantitatively estimating imposter recognition on each crystal face and hence computing modified crystal habits is presented. The fourth chapter describes the growth model for additives. Finally, a contextual analysis for organic salts and polar crystals is investigated in the fifth chapter.",,,
1479,"Experiments in Political Science: perspective taking, proposals, and how experiments contribute to political research","This thesis is broken into three parts. First, a study of perspective taking is presented. Employing an experimental approach, this study (Study 1) attempts to examine whether the cognitive mechanism of ""perspective taking"" can make participants' attitudes toward opposing political groups and viewpoints more positive, and make political ideology and stances on fiscal and social issues more moderate. Second, two proposals enhancing the original design are put forward, incorporating some of the lessons learned during Study 1. The third section discusses experiments and their contributions to political science. While they are not presented as the ultimate method within the diverse methodological toolbox in political science, this thesis does contend that some previous notions regarding experiments within the discipline are misguided.",,,
1480,Battling Spam and Sybils on the Social Web,"Since 2004, the social web has become a dominant force on the Internet. As of 2011, 65% of adults in the US used online social networking (OSN) sites, and this number continues to grow, both in the US and around the world. However, as OSNs gradually supplant email and instant messaging as the primary channel for online communication, the incentive for malicious users to attack these systems grows. Social spam and fake Sybil accounts are now the primary tools for online criminals looking to spreadmalware and steal personal information on OSNs. In this work, we take the first steps towards measuring, understanding, and defending against these threats to the social web. We begin by conducting detailed studies of two of the largest OSNs in the world: Facebook and Renren. Quantifying the basic graph structural properties of these OSNs gives us a solid foundation of understanding on which to build further research. Our work goes beyond existing studies that are focused on static topologies by accounting for the relative importance of individual edges of the social graph. By analyzing visible and latent interactions between users, we show that all edges in social graphs are not equally important, and develop ""interaction graphs"" to capture these effects. Through simulations on real social graphs, we show that edge importance has a large effect on the performance of social applications. This result indicates that ongoing research into social applications and algorithms should take user interactions into account if they hope to obtain realistic and accurate results. Our baseline OSN measurements allow us to characterize the behavior of normal users in great detail, which opens a window of opportunity for identifying anomalies associated with malicious activity. As a first step towards understanding malicious activity on OSNs, we examine its most prominent outward symptom: spam. We analyze hundreds of millions of wall posts received by millions of Facebook users and develop a novel set of automated techniques to detect social spam. Our results show that a significant portion of the URLs shared on Facebook are spam, the majority of which link to malicious phishing websites. These spam attacks are organized into large, coordinated campaigns by criminals working behind the scenes. Analysis of the behavior of spamming accounts demonstrates that both fake, Sybil accounts and compromised normal accounts are used as tools to attack Facebook users. Next, we turn our attention to the problem of Sybil accounts. Although our work on spam detection identified Sybils as a major threat to OSNs, at the time no practical solutions to this problem had been developed. To address this challenge, we use ground truth data provided by Renren Inc. to build a measurement based Sybil detector. This system is currently deployed on the Renren OSN, and to date it has caught and banned millions of Sybils. Importantly, our detector operates in real-time, meaning that Sybils are banned before they get a chance to generate harmful spam. We study the edge creation behavior of Sybils on Renren, and find that contrary to prior conjecture, they do not form tight-knit communities. Instead, they integrate into the social graph just like normal users. This result confirms our hypothesis that existing Sybil community detectors from the literature are unlikely to succeed on today's OSNs. In summary, our research makes two fundamental contributions to the study of OSNs. First, our work demonstrates the necessity of measurement driven design of social systems. Repeatedly, our measurements have contradicted assumptions from prior work, and thus revealed new avenues of research. Second, we have discovered, quantified, and developed practical solutions for pressing OSN security problems. However, the social web continues to evolve, and the shape of its attack surface is constantly changing. Attackers will continue to innovate new and unexpected strategies to exploit OSNs and evade security mechanisms. Only by bringing all of our tools to bear: measurement, graph analysis, data mining, machine learning, etc., can computer scientists hope to defend against future threats to the social web.",,,
1481,Integrating Non-consumptive Interactions with Classic Ecology: Impacts on Community Dynamics and Implications for Management,"Although ecologists have traditionally focused on how predators impact prey and communities via consumption, a growing body of work suggests the mere presence of predators may cause important community changes. Prey responses to predator presence may include changes in behavior, morphology, or development, and these changes often result in reductions in both prey growth and predator-induced mortality. Despite evidence these non-consumptive interactions may be pervasive in ecological communities, the impacts of prey responses to predators have still not been fully integrated into our existing understanding of how species interactions influence community dynamics. In order to demonstrate the importance of considering non-consumptive interactions in a community context, here I present evidence that non-consumptive interactions play an important, overlooked role in a classic ecological study system on the west coast of North America and that these interactions may be modified by habitat complexity. I also discuss how considering this class of interactions may be crucial to resource management strategies and offer a trade-offs based framework to integrate non-consumptive interactions with other conceptual and quantitative models of community dynamics. Keystone predator ochre sea stars (Pisaster ochraceus) are best known for consuming mussels. However, their presence also leads to reduced feeding and growth in co-occuring predatory whelks (Nucella sp) that they rarely consume. Whelk responses to sea stars are not density-dependent, suggesting non-consumptive interactions may play an important role in enabling small, fluctuating predator populations to limit prey growth. Sea stars therefore appear to serve dual roles of keystone consumers and keystone intimidators in intertidal communities. Habitat complexity, however, may play a key role in mediating non-consumptive interactions between sea stars and whelks. In another set of experiments considering the impacts of three levels of habitat complexity on whelk interactions with stars, stars only had marginally significant impacts on whelk feeding in mid-complexity habitats and only impacted growth in low and mid- levels of habitat complexity. Whelks in the presence of stars also preferred more complex habitats. This suggests that whelks may actively seek refuge space or leave areas where stars are found. Non-consumptive interactions may actually serve to move the location of whelk impact and play an important role in gap formation in mussel beds. Habitat complexity also has direct impacts on the ability of whelks to persist in a site as measured by a mark-recapture experiment. Overall, this suggests habitat complexity may play an important, under-studied role in intertidal community dynamics by mediating tradeoffs between access to food and refuge from factors such as waves and predators. Following these results and those from other communities, I propose non-consumptive interactions may be so common that considering them may be integral to the success of conservation and management programs. I highlight existing research demonstrating how non-consumptive interactions may impact captive rearing, eco-system based management, invasive species, and biocontrol research and suggest work in these areas may also lead to insight concerning non-consumptive effects that may be impossible to glean from typical ecological studies. Finally, I develop a tradeoff-based framework for considering the impacts of non-consumptive interactions and further integrating them into existing conceptual and theoretical models for community dynamics. This framework focuses on three tradeoffs inherent in non-consumptive interactions: the ability to detect and respond to predators, the costs associated with increased responses, and how these costs (changes in prey growth rate) are accomplished. I integrate this framework into a model of exploitative and apparent competition and demonstrate non-consumptive interactions may impact the ability of species to coexist even in the absence of a predator. When all the trophic levels are present, non-consumptive interactions change predicted equilibrium population sizes for predators, prey, and resources, and the magnitude of these impacts vary based on how prey reduce predation mortality.",,,
1482,Advanced Computational Field Theory Methods for Fluctuating Polymer Solutions,"Field-theoretic modeling offers a powerful framework for the theoretical investigation of polymeric systems, but computational study of polymer field theories has primarily been limited to mean-field self-consistent field theory calculations that neglect fluctuation physics. An important recent computational advance has been the introduction of field-theoretic simulations that use complex Langevin sampling to capture the full fluctuation physics of polymer field theories. Such simulations offer great promise for exploring the physics of solvated polymer and polyelectrolyte systems in which fluctuations make essential physical contributions that are not captured by mean-field methods. However, many theoretical and computational difficulties encountered when executing field-theoretic simulations have thus far limited the widespread adoption of the technique. This thesis presents several methodological advances that facilitate efficient, large-scale, non-pathological field-theoretic simulations of polymer solutions. A theoretical regularization framework is introduced that eliminates ultraviolet divergence pathologies from the field-theoretic models used as the basis for field-theoretic simulations of polymers. An exponential differencing algorithm is presented for integrating the complex Langevin equations employed in field-theoretic simulations, and is shown to have favorable accuracy and stability properties compared to previously introduced algorithms. Two completely separate frameworks for the systematic numerical coarse-graining of polymer field theories are presented, intended to facilitate efficient simulations of large multiscale systems. The first framework uses force-matching concepts originally developed for the coarse graining of particle-based molecular models to generate coarse-grained statistical field theories, and is shown to enable field-theoretic simulation of polymer solutions on coarsely-spaced computational lattices with reduced lattice discretization error. The second framework uses relative entropy minimization to map density probability distributions rather than field probability distributions, and is applied to field-theoretic simulations of polyelectrolyte coacervate complexation, in which pathological field-density relationships interfere with the force-matching coarse-graining method. In addition to these methodological advances for field-theoretic simulations of polymers, this thesis also includes a study of concentration fluctuations in polymer solutions in extensional flow. It is well-known that shear flows under appropriate conditions can exhibit dramatically amplified concentration fluctuations, but the behavior of fluctuations in extensional flows has been less well investigated. A two-fluid continuum model with a realistic extensive constitutive equation is used to calculate predicted structure factors for a variety of flow conditions, which compare well with the limited experimental data available.",,,
1483,Identifying Learning and Performance in a Visuomotor Task,"To ensure a consistent and reliable mathematical representation of human motor performance and learning we provide a framework based on existing modeling methodologies. The framework uses structured and unstructured linear time invariant control models, to describe human motor behavior for individual trials of a compensatory tracking experiment. Control-theoretic metrics are used to quantify performance and learning of participant behavior across trials. Unstructured models, such as subspace identification, were determined to provided excellent prediction of human performance. Feedback learning was associated with increased weighted coherence across trials, during our characterization for trial-by-trial learning. The utility of this framework provides a means for model selection by providing information performance and learning results for various commonly used methods. Additionally we investigate the influence of input signal attributes, frequency and complexity, on human performance and learning using m-level pseudo-random signals (m-level PRS) during a compensatory tracking task with position or velocity control. Our novel experimental design reveals that there exists a set of input signals, in particular, Low height High frequency (LhHf), that produce enhanced human performance and learning. We show the benefits of creating a model for each trial instead of trial averaging, ultimately demonstrating that reliable subspace models can be created. We identify feedback model parameters that quantify performance and learning effects across trials. Finally we present a novel method for separating human motor performance brain and body related dynamics into two separate models by combining imaging and input-output behavioral tracking data using subspace identification. Position and velocity control based human performance models were constructed from a compensatory tracking task with a learning induced feedback criteria using a set of pseudo-random signals (PRS) inputs. Standard fMRI analysis coupled with independent component analysis (ICA) revealed the activated brain regions most related to the tracking task. Imaging data from the activated regions are used as outputs and inputs with the tracking data for both the brain and body subspace models, respectively. We compare performance for conventional human motor subspace models with our novel two part brain-body model.",,,
1484,Three-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets,"Frustration, induced by competition between different interactions, can be realized on a diamond lattice, especially in A-site of spinel materials with a chemical formula AB2X 4. We address the realization of classical spin liquid and provide a unified theoretical explanation of various phenomena observed in spinel materials. Motivated by CoNb2O6, we study interplay between quantum criticality and geometric frustration. In the presence of carefully oriented magnetic field, the system realizes quantum phase transition of transverse field quantum Ising model while magnetic frustration exists due to the lattice geometry at the same time. We reveal several quantum magnetic phases and crossovers between one dimensional quantum criticality and several three dimensional quantum critical points. Lastly, we look for the possible realization of a quantum spin liquid focusing on A-site magnets in rare-earth pyrochlores. Based on a pseudospin-1/2 Hamiltonian, we discuss how quantum fluctuations lead the exotic phases such as a U(1) quantum spin liquid and XY ordered phases, beyond classical spin ice state.",,,
1485,Beautiful Painted Lies: Deception and Illusionistic Painting in the Seventeenth Century,"Traditions informing the deceptions perpetrated by seventeenth-century trompe-l'oeil paintings shine considerable light on the behavior of seventeenth-century artists, patrons, and viewers in unexpected ways. This study considers illusionistic paintings and written accounts of those experiencing them in the seventeenth century in conjunction with non-art historical scientific, philosophical, and social discourses of the period concerned with the subject of deceit. Questions on naturalism that remain a central subject in Netherlandish art history are elaborated upon, for, when considered deceptive, artists and their paintings reveal a variety of intriguing concerns. From this perspective, this dissertation argues that artists and their patrons fostered viewing responses that are surprisingly ideological with wide-ranging political and intellectual ramifications dependent on the immediate contexts in which they were made. To lie well, particularly in such a way that revealed the clever machinations of the deceit and established the participants' mastery of the subtleties of a given set of values, was a highly-desirable social and political achievement. Beautifully painted lies facilitated this exploration of deception. The complicity of original sites of trompe-l'oeil reception in the deceptive act -- in physical locations like artists' studios, churches, town halls, homes, and the marketplace -- was determined by attitudes to deceit specific to these contexts. A painting that lies will encourage very different responses determined by the expectations of the participants. The place of deception in the visual arts, and painting in particular, was a practice informed by professional concerns, art theory, and economic pursuits favored by seventeenth-century Netherlandish artists. The production of illusionistic painting by the artist Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts for the Danish kings in the 1660s and 70s in particular terms of the complimentary goals of an emerging absolutist court and of the knowledge-producing system of a kunstkammer. Alternatively, two illusionistically painted organ screens painted for prominent churches in Amsterdam, one by Cornelis Brise and the other by Gerard de Lairesse, provides an entirely different set of responses within a context dominated by Protestant concerns and contemporaneous controversies. In this environment, the delicate balance between morally proscribed lies and the activation of compelling visual deceptions underscores the visual appeal of trompe-l'oeil art of this period. The trompe-l'oeil paintings of Samuel van Hoogstraten and several of his contemporaries produced deceptive imagery for middle-class and royal patrons in Restoration England. Analysis of the written experiences of the bureaucrat Samuel Pepys with their illusions, serves as a means of accessing the social pressures and intellectual pursuits that responded to, and in turn informed, artistic production. By expanding the cultural referents of deception to include those determined by the immediate contexts for which trompe-l'oeil paintings were made, our understanding of a seemingly homogenous sub-genre is made far more complicated and versatile.",,,
1486,Investigation of factors causing inefficient translation termination and the regulation of the alternative ribosome rescue factor ArfA by tmRNA,"The ability to properly perform protein synthesis is essential to the survival of cells. This process, called translation, is catalyzed by the ribosome and must be done both at high speed and with high fidelity. Problems inherently occur during translation and must be dealt with by ribosome rescue systems to restore proper protein synthesis. The tmRNA-SmpB ribosome rescue system acts to resolve stalled ribosomes and also adds a peptide tag to incomplete proteins, which targets them for degradation. The tmRNA-SmpB ribosome rescue system and the alternative ribosome rescue system mediated by ArfA work in parallel to resolve problems occurring during protein synthesis, allowing proper translation to continue. This body of work uses biochemical and molecular techniques to investigate the causes of problematic protein synthesis as well as the systems in place to deal with theses problems and their regulation. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to translation and the translation cycle, the tmRNA-SmpB ribosome rescue system, mutations effecting translation termination, and the alternative ribosome rescue system mediated by ArfA. The effects of mutating the ribosome modifying pseudouridine synthase RluD is presented in chapter 2. This mutation causes an increase in tmRNA-mediated tagging of small ribosomal protein S7, resulting in slow growth. The regulation of the alternative ribosome rescue factor ArfA by tmRNA is discussed in chapter 3. In E. coli, tmRNA acts on the arfA transcript because the transcript contains a stem-loop, which is cleaved by RNase III. This results in ArfA being created off of a non-stop mRNA. Chapter 4 looks at the regulation of ArfA in other proteobacteria and discusses how ArfA of the beta-proteobacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae is created off of non-stop mRNA due to an intrinsic terminator within the open reading frame rather than by the action of RNases. Chapter 5 summarizes the work presented in this dissertation, examines its importance, and proposes questions about this work that still need to be answered.",,,
1487,Redundant Information and the Quantum-Classical Transition,"A state selected at random from the Hilbert space of a many-body system is overwhelmingly likely to exhibit highly non-classical correlations. For these typical states, half of the environment must be measured by an observer to determine the state of a given subsystem. The objectivity of classical reality---the fact that multiple observers can each agree on the state of a subsystem after measuring just a small fraction of its environment---implies that the correlations found in nature between macroscopic systems and their environments are very exceptional. This is understood through the redundant recording of information about the preferred states of a decohering system by its environment, a phenomenon known as quantum Darwinism. To see this in action in the real world, we first consider the ubiquitous case of blackbody illumination. We show that it exhibits fast and extensive proliferation of information about an object into the environment, yielding redundancies orders of magnitude larger than the exactly soluble models considered previously. Turning to a universe of qubits, we examine the conditions needed for the creation of branching states and study their demise through many-body interactions. We show that even constrained dynamics can suppress redundancies to the values typical of random states on relaxation timescales, and prove that these results hold exactly in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we connect these ideas to the consistent histories framework. Building on the criterion of partial-trace consistency, we introduce a sensible notion of mutual information between a fragment of the universe and a history itself.",,,
1488,"Study of the Structure, Composition, and Stability of Yttrium-Ti-Oxygen nm-Scale Features in Nano-Structured Ferritic Alloys","This work advances the understanding of the Y-Ti-O nanofeatures (NFs) in nanostructured ferritic alloys (NFAs); a class of high temperature, oxide dispersion strengthened iron alloys with applications in both advanced fission and fusion reactors. NFAs exhibit high creep strength up to 800_C and a remarkable radiation damage tolerance and He management. However, the NFs, which are responsible for these properties, are not fully understood. This work addresses key questions including: a) what is the NF structure and composition and how are they affected by alloy composition and processing; b) what is the NFA long-term thermal stability; c) and what alternative processing paths are available to reduce costs and produce more uniform NF distributions? A detailed study using small angle neutron scattering (SANS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM-group member Y. Wu), and atom probe tomography (APT) evaluated the NF average size (), number density (N), volume fraction (f), composition, and structure in two heats of the commercial NFA MA957. The and N were &ap;2.6 nm and &ap;5x1023 m-3 , respectively, for both heats, with TEM indicating the NF are Y 2Ti2O7. However, SANS indicates a mixture of NF compositions or atomic densities with a difference between the heats, while APT shows compositions with &ap; 10% Cr and a Y/Ti ratio < 1. However, microscope artifacts such as preferential undercounting of Y and O or trajectory aberrations that prevent resolving Ti segregation to the NF-matrix interface could account for the discrepancy. The microstructure and NFs in MA957 were stable for long times at temperatures up to 900_C. Notably, Ti in the matrix and some from the NFs migrates to large, Ti-rich phases. Aging at higher temperatures up to 1000_C for 19.5 kh produced modest coarsening for &ap; 3.8 nm and &ap;30% increase in grain size for a corresponding 13% reduction in microhardness. A coarsening model shows no significant NF coarsening will occur at temperatures less than 900_C. A number of 14YWT NFAs with different Y, Ti, and O content showed that increases in Y and Ti produce higher N and f, but the and the compositions are fairly insensitive. The O content has a more dramatic affect with low O (0.065 wt.%) producing low microhardness due to large grains (>10 mum) and large NFs with higher Y/Ti ratios. High O (0.249 wt.%) produced the smallest grain size, small NF, and highest microhardness. An alternative alloying technique adds Y during the gas atomization process, but the Y was phase separated, requiring 20 to 40 h attritor milling for adequate mixing. He atmosphere atomization produced more uniformly distributed Y compared to Ar and Ar/O atmospheres, and the Ar/O powder required longer milling. After milling, the Y-Ti-O solutes were concentrated on dislocation cell or grain boundaries, but were not highly associated with each other. The grain size distribution was bimodal for all annealing or consolidating at 1150_C and unimodal when consolidating at 850_C. The NF systematically increased and the N and f decreased with annealing temperature, and iso-thermal annealing tended to produce slightly smaller NFs. The final alloy produced (PM2) had a very high tensile strength with a low DBTT compared to other NFAs, but creep performance was scattered and requires additional testing.",,,
1489,"Land-use change, ecosystem services, and local livelihoods: Ecological and socioeconomic outcomes of Payment for Ecosystem Services in Ecuadorian paramo grasslands","This dissertation examines the socio-economic and ecological outcomes of emerging payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs targeting highland Andean grasslands (paramos) in Ecuador. While PES programs, in general, and in Ecuador in particular, are increasingly advocated as a way to link conservation and rural development, there is a noted lack of empirical research on the social and ecological outcomes of these initiatives. The primary objective of this research was to contribute to filling this gap. Chapter 2 focuses on Ecuador's SocioParamo program, a national-scale PES program targeting carbon, water, biodiversity, and poverty alleviation paramo grasslands. Participation resulted in gains in financial and non-financial capital, but outcomes depended on the context under which PES occurs. In many cases, PES strengthens adaptive capacity by providing a more diversified income source, but, in some cases, participation may increase vulnerability due to reduced access to permanent and seasonal grazing lands. Chapters 3 & 4 address changes in carbon storage and plant diversity under afforestation and burn exclusion, the two main land-use changes currently promoted by PES programs targeting paramos. Pine afforestation and burn exclusion increased aboveground carbon storage and had small, but variable, influence on soil carbon storage. Results suggest little immediate impact of fire on soil carbon storage, but that burn exclusion can lead to small increases in soil carbon storage, at least when some tussock cover is maintained. In both study areas, intermediate levels of burning maximized species richness, but results suggest that a mosaic of burn histories likely enhances landscape level plant diversity and richness. Pine afforestation led to a dramatic decrease in species richness in one field site, but supported a high diversity of species in another. However, in both sites, plant composition was dramatically different under pine than in native grasslands. These results constitute a significant step forward in better understanding PES in an applied context and are relevant for PES program development, particularly for programs targeting paramo grasslands. These findings can contribute to the development of more equitable and effective PES programs that help to protect the paramo for its ecological, cultural, and economic value.",,,
1490,Boundary conditions and unitarity in AdS/CFT,"This thesis investigates various issues regarding unitarity in the context of Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field theory (AdS/CFT) dualities. When the boundary duals are conformal, unitarity implies that there are lower bounds on the dimension of primary operators. Now, the AdS/CFT dictionary relates insertions of boundary operators to different choices of boundary conditions on the gravity side. Therefore, we expect the possible choices of boundary conditions in AdS to be restricted accordingly. Our first main goal will be to identify what are the pathologies that occur in the gravitational side of the duality when the boundary operators violate the pertinent unitarity bounds. In all the studied cases, we find that such bulk theories are ill-defined as expected, although unitarity is not nec- essarily violated. As our first example we consider a Klein-Gordon field in AdS, and extend the analysis to bosonic fields of spin 1 and 2 later on, with analogous results. Interestingly, it turns our that the bulk settings are pathological even in the absence of strict conformal invariance. Secondly, we argue that introducing a geometrical cut-off in spacetime along with the appropriate modifications of the boundary conditions yields the resulting (IR) theories well-defined. By study- ing in detail a Klein-Gordon field with boundary conditions that correspond to double-trace deformations, we are able to explicitly verify this claim. Finally, we discuss future research directions which include generalizations of AdS/CFT-like dualities and potential applications for condensed matter theory.",,,
1491,European Option Pricing in Illiquid Markets,"In this thesis, we study European option pricing and hedging problem under two incomplete market conditions: (1) with liquidity shocks, and (2) with regime-switching transaction costs. We consider market illiquidity as the inability to trade timely and transaction costs as proportional to the trading (buy/sell) amounts. Working within a Markovian regime-switching setting, we deem the market to have two regimes - one a regular trading regime and the other an illiquid no-trading regime, though in the transaction costs model, we generalize the two regimes to be both regular trading regimes but with different fundamental parameters. The pricing problem is solved by extending the Black-Scholes model in each regime with an extra accommodation for regime switching possibilities. This thesis consists of four chapters.",,,
1492,The March of Madness: A Communication Approach to Understanding the Quality of Teamwork in a Collegiate Basketball Team,"This multi-method qualitative investigation examines teamwork process of a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division 1 collegiate basketball team. The investigation was framed across multiple but complementary theories---dimensions of teamwork, symbolic interactionism, and dualities and tensions. The principal researcher conducted participant observations of team practices, meetings, meals, games, and travels to away games. Players and coaches also were interviewed during and after the season to reflect on the ways they worked together throughout the season. Finally, qualitative archival data analysis, including media coverage of the games and team documents (e.g., scouting reports), was conducted to compare and confirm information. This investigation found that the ways the team members developed and managed some of the fundamental dimensions of teamwork (i.e., vision, roles, operations/procedures, and vision) revealed underlying complexities associated with teamwork processes. More specifically, team members needed to negotiate several tensions (e.g., leadership and followership, performing and performance), in order to engage in processes critical to developing and managing teamwork. Effectively managing these tensions meant that members needed to be cognizant of their changing circumstances as well as sustaining some of their fundamental relational elements, such as trust and respect. More generally, findings also suggest that developing and managing teamwork is a context-sensitive process---one that transcends singular and linear path ideology of development. Attempting to develop and manage ambiguous situations underlying the dimension of teamwork dimensions demands frequent and reflective collaborations among members. Hence, these tensions and the ways members negotiate and collaborate in light of these tensions offers another approach to understand the quality of teamwork processes---one that is less hinged on the outcomes of teamwork.",,,
1493,"High-Affinity, Stable Peptide Ligands Engineered from a Kalata B1 Knottin Library","The widespread adoption of peptide therapeutics has been restricted by their poor stability and therefore their limited in vivo half-life and oral availability. Members of the knottin family of peptides possess inherent stability, which makes them attractive scaffolds for the development of therapeutic agents. Given its remarkable stability against digestive proteases, the cyclic knottin peptide kalata B1 was employed as a scaffold to create a large peptide library displayed on the surface of E. coli. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to isolate peptide ligands for two distinct protein targets: human thrombin and human neuropilin-1. Thrombin is a well-characterized enzyme involved in the blood coagulation cascade and was selected as a proof-of-concept target with which to validate our methodology for altering kalata B1 to bind a desired molecule. A series of thrombin ligands was successfully isolated from the naive kalata B1 bacterial display library. The thrombin ligands exhibited high nanomolar affinities in solution with slow dissociation rates and also inhibited thrombin's enzymatic activity. Importantly, 80% of one of the knottin-based thrombin inhibitors remained intact after a two hour incubation both with trypsin and with chymotrypsin, demonstrating that modifying the kalata B1 sequence did not compromise its stability properties. In addition, the kalata B1 scaffold mediated a 20-fold enhanced affinity to the thrombin ligand when compared to the same binding epitope constrained by a single disulfide bond, which highlighted the importance of screening for ligands within the context of the kalata B1 scaffold. These results indicated that peptide libraries derived from the kalata B1 scaffold can yield high-affinity ligands that retain the protease resistance associated with the parent peptide. Neuropilin-1 is an interesting therapeutic target for cancer and age-related macular degeneration since the receptor helps regulate angiogenesis. A neuropilin-binding ligand isolated from the original kalata B1-based library was used to construct a second-generation library with the goals of improving both the affinity and solubility of the originally identified peptide. The second-generation neuropilin-1 ligands exhibited solution affinities in the low nanomolar range, which was at least a ten-fold improvement over previously reported peptide ligands of neuropilin-1. Furthermore, the kalata B1-based neuropilin ligands showed low cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells. Overall, the strategies discussed in this dissertation may prove useful in the development of stable peptide ligands suitable for a variety of in vivo applications.",,,
1494,"Characterization of Polar, Semi-Polar, and Non-Polar p-n Homo and Hetero-junctions grown by Ammonia Molecular Beam Epitaxy","Widespread interest in the group III-Nitrides began with the achievement of p-type conductivity in the early 1990s in Mg-doped GaN films grown by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) by Nakamura et al. Indeed, MOCVD-grown Mg-doped GaN is insulating as-grown, because of the formation of neutral Mg-H complexes. Nakamura et al. showed that a rapid thermal anneal removes the hydrogen and enables p-conductivity. Shortly after this discovery, the first LEDs and lasers were demonstrated by Nakamura et al. The necessary annealing step is problematic for devices which need a buried p-layer, such as hetero-junction bipolar transistors. Ammonia molecular beam epitaxy (NH3-MBE) has a great potential for growing vertical III-Nitrides-based devices, thank to its N-rich growth conditions and all the usual advantages of MBE, which include a low-impurity growth environment, in situ monitoring techniques as well as the ability to grow sharp interfaces. We first investigated the growth of p-GaN by NH3-MBE. We found that the hole concentration strongly depends on the growth temperature. Thanks to comprehensive Hall and transfer length measurements, we found evidences for a compensating donor defects in NH3-MBE-grown Mg-doped GaN films. High-quality p-n junctions with very low reverse current and close to unity ideality factor were also grown and investigated. For the design of heterojunction devices such as laser diodes, light emitting diodes or heterojunction bipolar transistors, hetero-interface's characteristics such as the band offset or interface charges are fundamental. A technique developed by Kroemer et al. uses capacitance-voltage (C-V) profiling to extract band-offsets and charges at a hetero-interface. We applied this technique to the III-Nitrides. We discovered that for the polar III-Nitrides, the technique is not applicable because of the very large polarization charge. We nevertheless successfully measured the polarization charge at the AlGaN/GaN hetero-interface though C-V profiling. In the non-polar and semi-polar cases, the hetero-interface charge was low enough to extract the conduction band-offset through C-V profiling, provided that the doping profile had a foreseeable behavior.",,,
1495,La ropa sucia (ya no) se lava en casa: Acerca de la crisis de la familia en el cine latinoamericano contemporaneo,"My dissertation uses an interdisciplinary approach to examine the representation of the crisis of the family in contemporary Latin American cinema of the first decade of the twenty-first century. I argue that the representation of the crisis of the family in certain postmodern Latin American films is a symbol of the effects of the violent transition to a globalized world put into practice by authoritarian regimes and dirty wars. The motif of incest -and in lesser extent, of parricide- is a polysemic narrative device that operates as a sign for the impossibility of representation of the historic events of the recent past, the effects of which emerge as a phantasmagoric (post)memory and discontent in the Latin American society of the present. The cinematic works I discuss include eleven recent films from Argentina, Chile, Peru, Brazil, and Mexico: the Peruvian films Ojos que no ven (2003) by Francisco Lombardi, Jose Mendez's Dias de Santiago (2004), and Claudia Llosa's Madeinusa (2006); Sebastian Lelio's La sagrada familia (2004), Pablo Larrain's Fuga (2006), and Tony Manero (2008) from Chile; the Argentinean Geminis (2005) by Albertina Carri, and Lucia Puenzo's El nino pez (2009); Matheus Nachtergaele's A festa da menina morta (2008) from Brazil; Ricardo Montreuil's La mujer de mi hermano (2005), a Mexican, Peruvian, and Chilean co-production; and Carlos Reygadas's Batalla en el cielo (2005) from Mexico. Based on this cinematic selection, I propose that the representation of the crisis of the family, which emphasizes the transgression of the incest taboo, and parricide as motifs or recurrent themes, is an allegory of the culmination of a crisis, and at the same time, operates as an allegory of a symptom and critical device of the homogenized values of the patriarchal order that has lost its legitimacy. The criticism of these values focuses on the different modes of articulation of the roles in the family in terms of class, ethnicity, gender and sexuality, which questions at the same time the foundation of modernity as a homogeneous system that the postmodern narrative defies and fragments. The transgression of the incest taboo as a fundamentally masculine act, is at the same time an excess of power, and indicates that what is at question here is the patriarchal discourse as a valid and endurable one in a more heterogeneous and multifaceted emerging postmodern society at the threshold of the new century.",,,
1496,Analysis of Gain and Absorption Spectra of Gallium Nitride-based Laser Diodes,"Laser diodes (LDs) based on the III-Nitride material system, (Al,In,Ga)N, stand to satisfy a number of application needs, and their huge market segment has been further growing with the use of LDs for full color laser projection. All commercially available GaN-based devices are based on the conventional c-plane (polar) orientation of this material. However, strong polarization fields caused by strained quantum-well (QW) layers on c-plane induce the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE), which leads to reduced radiative recombination rate and are aggravated when more indium is added into the QW(s) in order to achieve longer wavelengths. A promising solution for this is the use of nonpolar and semipolar crystal growth orientations. Elimination or mitigation of polarization-related fields within the QWs grown along these novel orientations is observed and one expects increased radiative recombination rate and stabilization of the wavelength emission with respect to the injection current. In order to have more insights on the advantages of using the novel crystal orientations of the III-Nitride material system, we compare the gain of LD structures fabricated from c-plane, nonpolar and semipolar GaN substrates. Using thesegmented contact method, single-pass gain spectra of LD epitaxial structures at wafer level are compared for the different crystal orientations as well as the single-pass absorption coefficient spectrum of the active region material and its dependence on reversed bias. Experimental gain spectra under continuous-wave (CW) operation of actual industry LDs fabricated from c-plane and nonpolar/semipolar GaN-based materials emitting wavelengths in the visible are then presented, using the Hakki-Paoli technique at high resolution. Measurements of the transparency current density, total losses and differential modal gain curves up to threshold are analyzed and compared between nonpolar/semipolar and c-plane LDs in violet and blue spectral regions regions. In a preliminary analysis, we investigated the gain spectrum of non-c-plane green LDs and observed a significantly lower total linewidth (homogeneous plus inhomogeneous) than reported elsewhere, which seems to indicate that inhomogeneous broadening is not the main issue governing the evolution toward high performance green LDs.",,,
1497,"Impact of solution constituents, natural stimuli, and material properties on nanoparticle agglomeration in aqueous environments","Accompanying the booming of nanotechnology are the rising concerns on its potential environmental risks. The recent detection of engineered nanomaterials in natural streams, together with the recent discovery of ENPs' toxicity to a range of biological receptors, necessitates the investigation on their fate and transport. This dissertation research aimed to improve our understanding on one of the key ENP transport processes, agglomeration, and the crucial parameters that control this process. ZnO, TiO2, CeO2, and citrate-coated Ag were used as model ENPs given their dominating production rate. The experimental techniques include a combination of material characterization, agglomeration, sedimentation and adsorption processes monitoring, and inter-particle interaction calculations. Our results showed that ENPs agglomeration is controlled by a range of external and internal parameters. The external parameters investigated include ionic strength (IS), pH, natural organic matter (NOM) concentration, and the presence of clay particles. The agglomeration of ENPs was found to be sensitive to the indifferent electrolyte and exhibited DLVO-type two-regime pattern. The Critical Coagulation Concentration (CCC) increased significantly as the pH went further away from the point of zero charge. NOM substantially hindered the agglomeration of ENPs at high concentrations and facilitated attachment at low concentrations. We found that the patch-wise charge heterogeneity of clay minerals and its complex response to pH and IS variations produce rich interaction patterns between clay and ENPs. Clay particles were capable of destabilizing both positively and negatively charged nanoparticles under favorable solution chemistries. The internal parameters examined include particle size, morphology, crystal structure, and the sintered structure. The agglomeration of 10 TiO2 with varying material properties was studied. CCCs of anatase spheres correlate well with particle size, which agrees with the DLVO prediction; while CCCs of rutile rods strongly depend upon the specific surface area, indicating it is the surface chemistry rather than the bulk properties that dominates rutile rods agglomeration. The unique sintered structured of metal oxide NPs formed during the high-temperature synthesis process were found to render NPs a rather weak inter-cluster attraction, which can be disrupted by common environmental stimuli such as light exposure or temperature variation.",,,
1498,"Romantic Conscience: Conscience Formation and the Social Emotions in Jean-Jacques Rousseau, William Wordsworth, and Percy Shelley","My dissertation examines the idea of conscience in the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and in two English romantic poets, William Wordsworth and Percy Shelley, whose thinking about conscience grows out of a dialogue with Rousseau. I concentrate primarily on shame and guilt and other emotions associated with conscience, following Rousseau's definition of conscience as a moral sentiment, although not to the exclusion of other aspects such as self-reflection. Throughout, I address three broad issues: I demonstrate the influence of Rousseau's thinking about conscience on Wordsworth and Shelley; I elaborate these three formulations of conscience and their relation to Enlightenment and psychoanalytic concepts of the mind; and I examine the role of these formulations in each author's reflections on writing and the modes of self-representation and self-reformation that writing entails. I argue that the double or split consciousness commonly ascribed to the narrators of Rousseau's Confessions, Wordsworth's Prelude, and Shelley's Alastor bears a particular relation to the notions of conscience that emerge in these texts as they revise traditional concepts of guilt and authority. In fact, a major claim of this dissertation is that Rousseau's cultivation of internal divisions within the psyche---in particular of a consciousness of such divisions---is one of his major legacies to the thought of English romanticism. On a deeper level, I also suggest that the self-division by which the writer judges, and thus gains distance on, his own or his society's guilt is one of the devices that allows him to re-access affects that are the means of liberation or change. By this I mean not only the recentering of conscience on shame, rather than guilt, which follows from the general diffusion of agency that characterizes notions of selfhood in Rousseau and Shelley, if not Wordsworth. I also mean that each writer desires to reconnect with affects that speak to, because they emerge from, something analogous to Rousseau's l'homme de la nature or natural man. Their project of recreating conscience includes an attempt to root conscience more securely in the emotions, such as compassion, that Rousseau associates with l'homme de la nature. It thus radically reconfigures shame and guilt and the other social emotions, so that they are guided by this reformatory affect and by an aversion to harming the other, rather than by a more superficial concern for one's image in the eyes of the other, such as typically motivates envy and the desire for revenge. The narratives about conscience formation that I discuss typically comprise a two-part process, in which a moment of rebellion is followed by a hesitation or reassessment. After checking his rebellion, each writer articulates a new form of authority or a new constitution of the social. My project revises the dominant treatment of the second part of this process, which associates it primarily with political reaction or retreat, especially in the case of Wordsworth, and a return to convention. The moment of reengagement with the social, I argue, is an attempt to recreate conscience so that less punitive and more vital and compassionate than censorious or sin-based models. The trajectory of my project also describes a gradual enlarging of the scope of possible models for conscience, from family and small communities in Rousseau to nation in Wordsworth to Shelley's international community of poets--a community of poets, in the largest sense, of whom Shelley would come to consider Rousseau the paradigmatic model.",,,
1499,"The (Re)construction of Blackness in Costa Chica, Oaxaca: NGOs and the Making of an Afro-Mexican Ethnic Group","Afro-Mexicans in Costa Chica, Oaxaca to date do not identify with the aforementioned label but rather as Mexicans, Costen s, Moren s, Negr s. In 1998, however, Oaxaca became the first state to ""recognize"" and ascribe them under that ethnic label; thus, placing their collective rights under Indigenous laws. Though, no official headcount statistics or adequate public policies exist for the estimated 15,000 Afro-Mexicans. According to government studies, Afro-Mexicans have an ethnic deficit based on their lack of cultural characteristics that differentiate them from mestizos-costenos. As part of negotiating this matter, by 2004, the black civil association AFRICA invented a tradition of Afro-Mexican Queen Pageants (AMQPs hereafter) called ""La Reyna Afromestiza"" (The Afromestiza Queen). Four years later, in April of 2008, the image of the 1st crowned queen was then chosen for the cover of the 1st Oaxacan government journal dedicated to the Afro-Mexican population. These examples in turn raise the following questions: 1) What are the missing ""ethnic"" characteristics that disqualify Afro-Mexicans as an ethnic group? 2) How are AMQPs mirroring internal and external politics of representation? 3) To what extent are the state and civil associations (NGOs) transforming the meaning and contours of blackness in Oaxaca? Beginning with the birth of the Afromestizo project in 1950 to what followed after the birth of the black social movement in 1997, this investigation will examine the difficulties of ethnicizing blackness in Costa Chica, Oaxaca. By first offering a social-historical background of the region as well as highlighting the inter-ethnicity of Afro-Mexicans I draw attention to the interplay of ethnic-racial politics. More specifically, this study analyzes how AFRICA has, since 2007, steered the strategies of the movement in order to construct collective black political consciousness. In the process, I address how this organization has manipulated the media and public festivities---in their community and beyond---to give visibility and challenge Oaxaca's models of multicultural and pluriethnic policies. Using an interdisciplinary approach, I argue that AMQPs are a fine example of how AFRICA manipulates the performance and aesthetics of public space to construct black ethnic consciousness within costeno culture. In addition, I explain how they serve as ideal platforms to reclaim Mexican citizenship. Overall, this study will explore questions of ethnicity, race, memory, ritual and cultural-reinvention.",,,
1500,Secure Control Systems: A Control-Theoretic Approach to Cyber-Physical Security,"Cyber-physical systems and networks form a ubiquitous computing substrate that underlies much of modern technological society. Examples include embedded systems, such as medical devices, communication peripherals, smart vehicles, and large-scale systems, such as transportation networks, power generation grids, and water distribution systems. Researchers and hackers have recently shown that cyber-physical systems are vulnerable to remote attacks targeting their physical infrastructure or their data management and communication layer. Due to the crucial role of cyber-physical systems in everyday life, the development of advanced security monitors is of utmost importance. This thesis addresses problems concerning security of cyber-physical systems. Our contribution is threefold. First, we propose a unified modeling framework for cyber-physical systems, monitors, and attacks. For our model we define the notions of detectability and identifiability of an attack by its effect on output measurements, and we characterize fundamental monitoring limitations. Additionally, we provide algebraic and graph-theoretic tests for the existence of undetectable and unidentifiable attacks in cyber-physical systems. Second, we design centralized and distributed monitors for the detection and identification of attacks from output measurements. Our monitors leverage on tools from control theory and distributed computing, such as conditioned invariant subspaces and waveform relaxation techniques. Our monitors are provably correct, and effective against attacks targeting both the physical infrastructure and the communication layer. Third, we exploit our findings to design undetectable attack strategies. Our attack design method relies upon the control-theoretic notion of controlled invariant subspace. Our attack strategy is specific, in the sense that the attack signal is cast to alter the system functionality in a pre-specified manner. Finally, we present several illustrative examples. Besides showing the effectiveness of our methods for the analysis of systems vulnerabilities, the design of security monitors, and the synthesis of attack strategies, our numerical examples confirm that our methods are effective also in the presence of system noise and unmodeled dynamics.",,,
1501,"Investigation of the 6d and 5f Orbital Contributions in Actinide Complexes Containing Amide, Ketimide, Aryl, and Alkyl Metal-Ligand Bonds","Treatment of UCl4 with 6 equiv of LiNHtBu generates the U(IV) amide complex, {[Li(THF)2Cl]2[Li]2[U(NH tBu)6]}n in good yields. Oxidation of {[Li(THF) 2Cl]2[Li]2[U(NHtBu)6]} n with 1 equiv AgOTf results in the formation of the bis(imido) complex [Li(THF)]2[U(NtBu)2(NHtBu) 4]. The reaction of UCl4 with 5 equiv of the secondary amide, LiNC5H10, gives the U(IV) amide complex, [Li(DME)][U(NC 5H10)5]. [Li(DME)][U(NC5H10) 5] is readily amenable to oxidation to generate the U(V) and U(VI) amides, [Li(DME)3][U(NC5H10)6] and U(NC 5H10)6, respectively. Addition of 5 equiv of LiN=CtBu2 or LiN=C tBuPh to UCl4 results in the formation of either [Li(THF)][U(N=C tBu2)5] or [Li(THF)2][U(N=C tBuPh)5]. Oxidation of [Li(THF)][U(N=CtBu 2)5] with 0.5 equiv I2 generates the U(V) complex, U(N=CtBu2)5. However, oxidation of [Li(THF) 2][U(N=CtBuPh)5] with 0.5 equiv I2 in the presence of 1 equiv of LiN=CtBuPh generates the U(V) complex [Li][U(N=CtBuPh)6]. [Li][U(N=C tBuPh)6] can be oxidized with 0.5 equiv I2 to give the U(VI) complex, U(N=CtBuPh)6. Electronic structure of [Li][U(N=CtBuPh)6] reveals that the strength of the sigma- and pi-interactions between the ligand 2p and the uranium 5f orbitals is similar to those exhibited by [UX6] --. (X = F, Cl, Br). Reaction of UO2Cl2(THF)3 with 4 equiv of LiNC5H10 results in the formation of the dimeric uranyl complex, [{Li(DME)}2Cl][Li(DME)][UO2(NC 5H10)3]2. [{Li(DME)}2Cl][Li(DME)][UO 2(NC5H10)3]2 exhibits lengthened U=O bond lengths due to the strong sigma- and pi-donating NC5H 10 ligands. Reaction of UO2Cl2(THF)3 with 4 equiv of Li(NH-2,6-C6H3Me2) generates the monomeric uranyl complex, [Li(THF)(Et2O)]2[UO 2(NH-2,6-Me2C6H3)4], however, U=O activation is not observed. Reaction of UO2Cl2(THF) 3 with 4 equiv of either LiN=CtBu2 or LiN=CtBuPh gives the monomeric uranyl complexes, [Li(THF)(TMEDA)][UO2(N=C tBu2)3] and [Li(THF)(Et2O)] 2[UO2(N=CtBuPh)4], respectively, and U=O bond activation is observed. Reaction of ThCl4(DME)2 with 5 equiv of either LiCH2 tBu or LiCH2SiMe3 generates the Th(IV) alkyl complexes, [Li(THF)4][Th(CH2 tBu)5] or [Li(DME)2][Th(CH2SiMe 3)5]. Similarly, reaction of ThCl4(DME)2 with 6 equiv KCH2Ph results in the formation of [K(THF)] 2[Th(CH2C6H5)6]2. The stability of these complexes is attributed to saturation of the coordination sphere to form ""ate"" complexes.",,,
1502,"The cronista (re)writes the nation: Memory and ""alternative histories"" in cronicas of Mexican centennial and bicentennial commemorations of independence","This study examines the relationship between the Latin American journalistic cronica (""chronicle"") and memory, specifically the way writers used highly imaginative cronicas as a means to uphold or challenge official memory and history and to propose ""alternative"" readings of the nation during Mexico's centenary and bicentenary commemorations of Independence of 1910, 1921, and 2010. The centenarios were times when historical memory was of paramount importance and that foregrounded two long-standing obsessions of the cronica: the topic of national identity and an interest in great historical events. Positing the cronica as a sort of literary lieu de memoire (""site of memory""), the study analyzes works from Mexican and Mexican American cronistas (""chroniclers"") drawn from current and turn-of-the-century periodical sources including writings by Juan B. Urrutia, ""Cagliostro,"" Rafael Lopez, Jose D. Frias, Jose de Jesus Nunez y Dominguez, Jorge Ulica (Julio G. Arce), Carlos Monsivais, Rafael Perez Gay, and Hermann Bellinghausen. The study contends that the modern cronica (1910, 1921) and the postmodern cronica (2010) as works of memory differ in their literary treatment of events, partly due to the changing role of the cronista as well as changes in the form/content, functions, and reception of the literary chronicle from one century to the next. In the case of the Mexican independence celebrations examined here, ""alternative histories"" or narratives of the nation's past also responded to changes associated with the paradigmatic shift from modernity to postmodernity. While for turn-of-the-century modernista writers, for instance, the cronica itself was an experiment in creative journalism, cronicas today, often published in blogs, or online journals or newspapers, involve new forms of experimentation, are not necessarily published by professional writers or intellectuals, and may involve reader participation (or ""modification"" of official memory through online commentary and social networking tools). Furthermore, while nineteenth-century cronicas sought to express a singular, monolithic version of national identity, now postmodern or late twentieth and early twenty-first century cronistas tend to question such metanarratives or ""all-encompassing"" explanations of knowledge or ""absolute truths"". Todays cronistas also seem less likely to function as an authoritative source of knowledge (or ""memory""), as readers now have the ability to quickly and easily verify information on their own (via the internet) and to interact with electronically published texts to question them or to provide their own versions of ""what happened""; that is, to provide countermemories. Critical studies to date have been unable to provide a definition of the literary cronica that accounts for diachronic changes as well as issues relating to the genre's formal hybridity (between literature and journalism) or its official or unofficial stance toward state-backed concerns. I argue, however, that reading the cronica as memory transcends these questions and provides an important bridge to a more all-inclusive definition of the genre, thus establishing its significance in the literary canon and offering an additional approach to its critical study.",,,
1503,"The Development of Preservice English Teacher Beliefs about Literacy, Teaching, and Students","The development of preservice teacher beliefs is a complicated, non-linear process. It has been suggested that preservice teacher beliefs are highly impacted by their past histories as students, and that these beliefs act as a filter for interpreting the coursework and ideas in their teacher education programs. Understanding the way preservice teachers form beliefs can give insight into the choices teachers enact in practice. This dissertation considers the processes by which a cohort of 12 preservice English teachers formed beliefs about literacy, teaching, and learning in a 13-month professional program. The study traces the belief development of the research participants and identifies opportunities within the teacher education program that promoted nuances in perspectives related to literacy, teaching, and learning. Grounded theory was used to code and interpret the ethnographic data collected in six courses. Data included in-class discourse, reflective writing, online forum posts, and high stakes writing assignments staggered throughout the program. Analysis of this data indicated that when candidates integrated experiential evidencing and theoretical referencing into their written and spoken discourse, their beliefs were more nuanced. The findings also indicated that while candidates entered with pre-existing beliefs, these beliefs did not necessarily change, but instead developed within given contexts. This study therefore suggests a fresh way of framing forthcoming research on teacher beliefs, not as constructs that are static or in need of changing, but instead as resources that candidates draw from in relation to certain contexts and opportunities.",,,
1504,The Study of Success in Music: Applying Methods Developed by Sports Psychology towards Achieving Peak Performance,"This document is intended to serve as a supplemental guide for musicians, outlining the advantageous mental and physical practice techniques and methods which have been revealed through research in sports psychology. Additionally, this work draws on research in music psychology to investigate the numerous psychological obstacles and challenges musicians must overcome in order to develop a consistently high level of performance. Case studies from the field of music psychology are discussed, as this document seeks to expose some of the common triggers for performance anxiety and stage fright. This document further discusses those principles of sports psychology which are applicable to a musician's daily practice and which pave the way for better control over the physical and psychological symptoms known to negatively impact peak performance in situations of extreme pressure. Applying these principles also helps in the development of increased control of muscular and mental functions, accuracy, precision, discipline, mental awareness and overall coordination. With this information, I hope to educate musicians about the existing relationship between mental process and physical execution and the impact one has on the other. This document reveals how successful performance should be viewed as a process with its roots in developments that occur even before picking up the instrument. Finally, this paper hinges on the idea that, through the efficient application of sports psychology principles, musicians can learn how to feel `as one' with the instrument, a feeling of one-ness that sports psychology refers to as the `zone'.",,,
1505,"Design, Growth and Fabrication of Nitride-based Semipolar (2021) Laser Diodes","Nonpolar and semipolar planes on wurtzite nitride have attracted much attention due to their eliminated and reduced polarization-related electric field in the quantum wells (QWs). Violet and blue nonpolar m-plane laser diodes (LDs) have been demonstrated under continuous wave operation. However, the operation in green spectral region has been limited due to low In incorporation and the formation of basal plane stacking faults on m-plane. With decent In incorporation on semipolar planes, high performance green light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and LDs have been demonstrated on (2021) plane. On the other hand, low efficiency droop and high optical polarization ratio were also observed on semipolar (2021) LEDs. The polarity has strong impacts on the growth characteristics and device performance on semipolar planes. With a 15 degree inclination angle of m-plane toward the N-polar surface, (2021) plane possesses a N-polar-like surface chemistry. The morphology of epitaxial growth on (2021) surface is sensitive to growth conditions such as the growth temperature and the growth rate. Striation morphologies along the a-axis were observed on InGaN QWs grown on (2021) substrates, indicating a high adatom diffusion anisotropy. However, the piezoelectric polarizations of InGaN QWs on the (2021) plane are parallel to those on the Ga-polar plane with a quarter magnitude. Polarization-related electric fields in the (2021) QWs cancel the built-in electric fields in the p-n junction, resulting in a nearly-flat QW potential profile under zero bias. By band diagram simulations, the potential profile of (2021) QWs is insensitive to the applied bias and current injection. Along with high compositional homogeneity in the QWs, the semipolar (2021) LEDs and LDs showed minimal wavelength blueshift over three orders of injection current levels. Index-guided ridge lasers with cleaved facets were fabricated. Polishing and dry-etching were applied on the backside surface after lapping to improve the contact characteristics. To suppress the morphologies, InGaN/GaN superlattices were used as guiding layers instead of conventional bulk InGaN layers. Semipolar (2021) laser diodes with lasing wavelength up to 505 nm were demonstrated with 4 nm blueshift between the spontaneous emission and lasing.",,,
1506,Stochastic Analysis of Protein Expression and Gene Regulatory Network based on Experimental Fluorescence Histograms,"This thesis develops a novel method, fluorescence grid based aggregation (FGBA), to justify a dynamical model of protein expression using experimental fluorescence histograms. In FGBA method, we first describe the dynamics of the gene-protein system by a chemical master equation (CME), while the protein production rates are unknown. Second, we aggregate the states of the CME into unknown group sizes. Then, we show that these unknown values can be replaced by the data from the experimental fluorescence histograms. Consequently, final probability distributions correspond to the experimental fluorescence histograms. In particular, we focus our study on Antigen 43 (Ag43), which is an abundant outer membrane protein in Escherichia coli. This protein is not involved in feedback regulation, and instead the encoding gene, agn43, uses a mechanism of generating multiple phases in order to regulate the protein production. In this document, we first employ our FGBA method to the dynamical system of agn43's phase variation introduced by (Lim et al., 2007) and validate our method by comparing the final probability distributions with Lim's experimental fluorescence intensity histograms. Next, we propose a novel toggle switch for the production of Ag43 based on the experimental results on structure, function, and regulation of agn43 presented by (van der Woude et al., 2008).",,,
1507,The Role of Outer-Membrane Receptor Binding in Contact-Dependent Growth Inhibition Systems,"The contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) system is a bacterial mechanism which mediates competition and cell-cell adhesion. CDI was originally described in an isolate of Escherichia coli wherein a small, three-gene locus was sufficient to elicit growth inhibition of neighboring Escherichia coli K-12 populations upon cell-cell contact. Subsequently, CDI systems were identified in a number of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-proteobacteria. In this study, I compare and contrast bacterial CDI systems with other bacterial toxin delivery systems. I seek to characterize the effective species range of the Escherichia coli CDI system in hopes of understanding how CDI systems are disseminated and how they influence microbial growth and competition in complex environs. I go on to demonstrate that the effective species ranges of CDI systems are determined by two factors: variability in outer-membrane receptor proteins and the utilization of specific receptor-binding sequences within CdiA proteins. Furthermore, I demonstrate that the CDI system of Escherichia coli isolate EC93 mediates biofilm formation via a previously undescribed cell-cell adhesion mechanism. Finally, I speculate on the role of bacterial CDI systems in bacterial competition and group behaviors and offer a model of CDI propagation and dissemination.",,,
1508,Long-term retention in the cortical and subcortical procedural category-learning systems,"Although there has been a wealth of research into the decay properties of procedural memories, relatively little of this research stands on firm theoretical footing--in particular, while the issue of training duration has been investigated, the definitions used to distinguish ""overtraining"" from ordinary training are generally quite vague. On the other hand, the SPEED model of automaticity in category learning constitutes a well-encapsulated paradigm for describing the effects of overtraining in terms of a shift in the neural locus of behavior; this model was fitted to motivating behavioral data, and has since been tested using fMRI. However, the model only specifies learning processes, i.e., there are no characterizations of the decay that presumably affects all human memory systems. The present study is designed to examine the processes of memory decay, from within the framework of the SPEED model, and to elucidate possible decay properties of the neural systems underlying procedural learning and memory in this model. Using a well-described category-learning task, participants were trained for varying durations chosen to load preferentially on each of the two systems posited by the model. This variable was crossed factorially with testing interval: subjects returned for unsupervised test sessions either monthly, quarterly, or yearly over the one-year duration of the experiment. This allowed both for querying the timecourse of decay at varying granularities, as well as investigating so-called ""re-test effects."" Results demonstrate a substantial difference in the retention performance of the two training groups, quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, although sample size is limited, there is some evidence for differential re-test effects in the two groups, such that frequency of re-test had no measurable impact in one training group but showed a trend in the other group. These results are interpreted in terms of the motivating SPEED model, and suggestions for updating the model on the basis of the present findings are given.",,,
1510,Non-equilibrium aspects of the black hole-thermal state correspondence in string theory,"This dissertation contains the author's contributions to the study of non-equilibrium aspects of the correspondence between thermal states of quantum gauge field theories and black holes in string theory. This correspondence is contained in the larger holographic gauge/gravity duality, or AdS/CFT correspondence of string theory and M-theory. The work herein is divided into six fairly independent components. (1) We present results of a numerical simulation of the classical evolution of the plane-wave matrix model, which is dual to M-theory in a plane-wave background. We find evidence for rapid thermalization of the matrix model, related by the duality to the formation of a black hole. (2) We relate classical entropy production to the growth of entanglement entropy in a simple closed quantum system, in agreement with previous results for open quantum systems, and briefly investigate the dependence on the choice of coarse-graining. (3) We study the dynamics of a simple quantum system of two coupled degrees of freedom, one of which is undergoing non-adiabatic evolution. We study the resulting velocity dependent forces and quantum back-reaction. (4) We study the evolution of entanglement entropy due to local quenches in the D1--D5 conformal field theory (CFT), deformed away from the orbifold point, and discuss how this is one stage in a thermalization process, dual to the formation of a stringy black hole. (5) We investigate the holographic dual of a local quench of a CFT, and argue that it should be interpreted as a superposition of geometries. (6) We propose a quantum field theory state dual to a small anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole. Finally, we discuss how all these various investigations fit into the larger context of black hole physics and non-equilibrium dynamics.",,,
1511,Roberto Bolano: The Narrative Esthetics of a Personal Ethic,"Roberto Bolano: The Narrative Esthetics of a Personal Ethic. A thesis presented on the subject of Hispanic American Literature. This dissertation deals with the fictional works of Chilean writer Roberto Bolano, focusing largely on the narrative esthetics brought into play by the writer in his extensive oeuvre. This dissertation analyzes the esthetic resources that allow the author to construct a fictional self-representation that is manifested in the character Arturo Belano. This character functions as an ethical discourse on what Bolano considers the `true poet', which is an idealization of what the Latin-American writer `should be'. In other words, I explore how an ethical discourse can be originated from the esthetical construction of a fictional alter ego. In my dissertation, I analyze what elements are finely carved in Roberto Bolano's fictions, as a part of an intentionality to convey an ontological meaning for his and his group's place in the Hispanic American literary tradition. My dissertation answers what untold discourses lay behind the self-made representation of Roberto Bolano.",,,
1512,"Timing Machines: Time, Technology and Media","Timing effects, defined as the aesthetic experience of a media object that playfully alters the way we relate to the passage of time, have proliferated in twentieth century American culture. These timing effects are linked to the rapid advances in transportation and media technologies in different ways. Timing effects have proliferated in time travel narratives in popular culture, whether in films, novels, or TV shows, where the deep past or far future become accessible via machine technology, in the increasingly erratic ""flash-forward"" or ""flashback"" narratives, in the persistent desire to control the speed of the passage of time via technological affordances, or in reflective passages on the way the consciousness of time, for better or worse, has been affected by technology's presence. This dissertation examines the history of the special uses of timing effects, beginning in the modern period, continuing through the postmodern period and ultimately pointing toward the present digital moment. The works analyzed bring a preoccupation with time to bear on the themes of transportation and media technologies. In the silent film The General, for instance, Buster Keaton's body and physical comedy are often situated between train and film technology. In Jack Kerouac's On the Road the special relation between writing by typewriter and driving by automobile is channeled into the experience of (or need for) speed. And in Kurt Vonnegut's Slaugherhouse Five, the effects of technologies involving flight, dispersed through time, leave traumatic traces that upend a linear experience of the present in favor of flattened, timeless space. These works and more, as media objects, both exhibit the pleasure of timing effects via media and involve explorations of the relations between characters and transportation and media technologies. This dissertation contributes to the fields of media studies and twentieth century American culture an examination of the aesthetic of the timing effect, or what is described here as a poetics of out-of-stepness.",,,
1514,Targeting Social Communication Impairments in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders through Self-Management,"The literature suggests that pervasive and persistent symptoms related to social communication are a hallmark of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In addition to being core diagnostic symptoms of ASD, these symptoms relate to the extent to which children can engage in interactions that rely on social conversation skills. These pragmatic difficulties are commonly expressed in conversational exchanges that either lack the incorporation of personal narratives or incorporate personal narratives that are deficient or impoverished in nature. This is in contrast to neurotypically developing children who acquire personal narrative skills in early childhood and use these skills as an essential tool in their social interactions. The literature indicates that self-management strategies are effective in improving a range of social communication skills. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a self-management intervention on improving social communication skills as defined by personal narrative production during social conversation in children with ASD. The research question was addressed through a nonconcurrent multiple baseline across participants experimental design. The results indicate that the use of self-management strategies led to (a) increases in personal narrative production, (b) improvements in quality of personal narratives through increased narrative detail, (c) improvements in synchronous discourse, (d) increases in linguistic productivity, and (e) improvements in overall verbal ratings of pragmatics during social conversation. Moreover, the findings suggest generalization of treatment gains to novel conversational partners. Results are discussed in terms of clinical and theoretical implications for social communication interventions for children with ASD, parent training, peer involvement, and assessment of meaningful outcomes through complementary social validity measures.",,,
1515,Photophysical and Bioelectronic Investigation and Application of Amphiphilic Phenylenevinylene Oligoelectrolytes,"The main focus of this work is the modification of membranes via incorporation of phenylenevinylene oligoelectrolytes with the goal of tailoring their optical and electronic properties and their applications. Initial inception was based upon the idea that molecular architectures sharing kindred dimensions and distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions with that of phospholipid bilayers could be exploited for insertion of target compounds into membranes, subsequently modifying their optoelectronic properties. The general architecture of our conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) consists of linear and hydrophobic donor-pi-donor chromophores flanked at both ends with hydrophilic ionic pendant groups. These COEs are water-soluble, optically active and exhibit photophysical features sensitive to the polarity of the surrounding medium. Synthetic membranes were first employed for characterization of COE/membrane interactions. A combination of UV/visible absorbance and photoluminescence spectroscopies, and confocal microscopy were employed to confirm membrane incorporation. Examination of COE emission intensity profiles when in stationary multi-lamellar vesicles obtained with a polarized excitation source indicates that the orientations of these molecules are highly ordered, such that the hydrophobic electronically-delocalized region positions within the inner membrane with the long molecular axis perpendicular to the bilayer plane. Electrochemistry experiments provide evidence that COEs of this type facilitate transmembrane electron transport across lipid bilayers supported on glassy carbon electrodes. Fluorescence imaging of biological samples, including yeast and bacteria, stained with our oligoelectrolytes indicates preferential COE accumulation within cell membranes. The optical and electronic behavior of our COEs in membrane systems inspired their application for mediating charge transport across cell membranes between sites within microorganisms and electrodes of bioelectronic devices. The COEs were shown to facilitate more intimate bioelectronic interactions in microbial fuel cells and bioelectrochemical cells. Analysis of bioelectronic device performance as a function of COE structure and operating conditions yielded critical insight into the function of the COEs and has motivated current studies aimed at elucidating the specific mechanism by which COEs facilitate bioelectronic interactions. Development of key structure-function-property relationships within the various facets of our study necessitates modulation of COE structural features, thus a versatile synthetic strategy was developed to access the many COE analogs employed in this work.",,,
1516,"The Impact of Household HIV/AIDS on Fuel, Water and Subsistence Livelihoods: Evidence from the 2008-2009 Kenyan Demographic Health Survey","HIV/AIDS can present a significant economic, medical, and psychological shock to households in sub-Saharan Africa, and can considerably alter household livelihood behavior. While there is speculation that household impoverishment related to HIV-affliction and the onset of AIDS can drive households into greater dependence on their local, natural environment for food, medicine, fuel, construction materials, and other products, evidence is limited. This study queried the 2008-2009 Kenyan Demographic Health Survey Database for associations at the national level between household HIV-affliction and three natural resource use variables: primary household fuel type, drinking water source, and presence in the household of an adult self-reporting as a subsistence fisheries or agricultural worker. Manual, step-wise binomial and multinomial logistic regression models (N=4000+ households) were constructed to examine these associations while controlling for geographic and socio-demographic factors. Model results demonstrated that HIV-afflicted households were 40-70% less likely than un-afflicted households to use natural fuels compared to processed fuels, and 30% less likely (weighted model, only) to rely on surface water sources compared to purchased or engineered water sources. No difference was detected between HIV-afflicted versus un-afflicted households regarding presence of an adult engaged in subsistence fishery or agricultural work. While a cross-sectional analysis limits discussion of causality, possible explanations include household adaptation to labor loss and/or increased exposure to HIV infection of communities with access to infrastructure. The results of this study caution against case study bias in the existing HIV-environment literature, and highlight the need for randomized, longitudinal studies on this topic.",,,
1517,"Land, Labor, and Leisure: Northern Tourism in the Red Hills Region, 1890-1950","My dissertation project details the interconnections of race, labor, and land usage overtime from the late-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth-century U.S. South. To examine these themes closely, I focus on the Red Hills region, a forty-mile stretch of land between Thomas County, in southern Georgia, and Tallahassee, Florida. The area became a winter colony for wealthy northern hunters in the decades after Reconstruction, and thus prospered from regional tourism--a growing theme in scholarly studies of the New South. Northern hunters, almost all wealthy industrialists, consolidated land in the region, thus closing lands that would have otherwise been available for small-scale farming and for use as common hunting grounds. They employed a mostly African-American labor force to work on their estates as domestic servants, dog handlers, liverymen, and as sharecroppers and tenant farmers. By displacing whites and employing local blacks, hunting plantations became a divisive force in the town. Plantation owners were concerned with implementing what they considered to be a progressive labor policy with regards to their southern workers. What resulted was a model of welfare capitalism in which white owners created worker communities and subsidized homes, automobiles, and health care, in return for a workforce that remained closely clustered and thus under constant scrutiny. According to oral testimonies and memoirs from black plantation workers, white northerners fostered opportunities for class mobility in a place where labor was limited to agricultural or poorly paid domestic work, but they also circumscribed black action in many ways. As a scholarly case study, the Red Hills Region brings into relief lines of race, class, and regionalism in postwar society. As a public history project, the study allows for close work with Red Hills community members to document and interpret elements of the community's past that have previously gone unstudied.",,,
1518,Denunciation of Faith and Family: Crypto-Jews and the Inquisition in Seventeenth-Century Mexico,"Portuguese merchant families migrated to New Spain (colonial Mexico) in the early 1600s when the crowns of Spain and Portugal were united from 1580 to 1640. At the beginning of the 1640s, immediately after Portugal successfully rebelled and gained independence from Spain, the Holy Office of the Inquisition in Mexico began to arrest and try en-mass a group of these now wealthy Portuguese merchants living in Mexico whom it suspected of secretly practicing Judaism. By 1642 there were 200 individuals being tried, most of them languishing in the secret prisons of the tribunal. Over the course of the 1640s the secret trials continued and culminated in a final public Gran auto de fe (act of faith) on April 11, 1649, in which the sentences of the accused were announced. In the most egregious cases secular authorities executed the convicted. This dissertation examines the lives of three of these crypto-Jewish families. The dissertation first considers the institutional history of the Holy Office of the Inquisition in colonial Mexico from its founding in 1571 to the 1640s. It examines the procedures and personalities of the tribunal throughout these trials based on correspondence between the tribunal and its superior court in Madrid Spain, the Suprema. The dissertation presents detailed case studies of three family clusters, the Enriquez Mendez and the Leon Jaramillo, both of which immigrated originally from Portugal, to Spain and then to colonial Mexico. The third cluster is a smaller family led by a single mother, Ana Enriquez, who along with her daughter Isabel immigrated from Spain to colonial Mexico and became part of the merchant elite described above. All members of these three families were tried during this period, but had very different circumstances. In all three families, however, there was a generational divide between the generation of those who emigrated and continued to faithfully practice their Judaism, and the next generation of their children, who did not practice Judaism as readily. Furthermore, those children identified more closely with the multi-ethnic setting and the Hispanic Christianity they found in colonial Mexico. The sources about these families consisted of archival material, especially the Inquisition trials in which the witness depositions of the accused and of other witnesses describe not only the religion of these families, but their day-to-day lives as well. I have used archival material from Inquisition, financial, and other legal records found at archives in The United States, Spain, and Mexico.",,,
1519,Noise in Nonlinear MEMS as it Applies to Sensing,"In this work we consider sensing strategies using dynamic bifurcations in MEMS resonators. We examine the statistics of jump events that occur as a result of a linear parameter sweep through a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation in a parametrically driven MEMS resonator in the presence of noise. The statistics of jump events are compared to those derived from a simple one-dimensional model and are found to have good agreement. Issues related to how system and input parameters affect these statistics are described, and sweeping strategies that lead to precise, fast estimates of the bifurcation point, as essential for these sensors, are derived. It is shown that for a typical MEMS resonator an optimal sweep rate exists, and noise may need to be added to achieve optimal sensitivity. Next, we report the development and implementation of a new method for tracking parameters at which dynamic bifurcations occur in MEMS. The underlying theory is developed for subcritical pitchfork bifurcations that occur near the subharmonic instability experienced near parametric resonance. The method relies on observed changes in response phase and amplitude just prior to the bifurcation, and these are used to forebode the bifurcation. These precursors are then employed in a feedback control scheme to stabilize a parametrically excited MEMS device at the edge of instability, making it highly sensitive to changes in device parameters. Implementation of the controller is shown through experimental validation. A comparison with the previous method of bifurcation detection for the same device shows that the new approach offers an improvement of over three orders of magnitude for the bifurcation point acquisition rate. Finally, feedback control based only on the root mean square of the amplitude is utilized to stabilize a device on the ""edge"" of instability. By using the root mean square of the amplitude, the complexity of electronics is reduced and the proposed technique is extended to a MEMS clamped clamped beam with a natural frequency near 100kHz. Sensitivity to these device parameters is explored and initial results show sensitivity of 50 ppm while vibration amplitudes are maintained near the noise floor.",,,
1520,Ergodic Quotients in Analysis of Dynamical Systems,"The analysis of dynamical systems typically taught in introductory graduate courses focuses on analysis of trajectories: curves in the state space, parametrized by time. While the trajectory-based approach is successful in analyzing exceptional solutions, e.g., stable and unstable manifolds attached to fixed points, it is a poor choice for recognizing coarse patterns in state spaces, e.g., vortices in fluid-like flows. An alternative is the operator-theoretic description of dynamical systems. This doctoral project studied the Koopman operator, which describes how functions, or observables, change as the dynamical system evolves in time. The main interest was in identification of invariant sets in the state space, where behavior of the system is uniform ''on average''. The arrangement of invariant sets is connected to the ergodic quotient: a subset of a sequence space where trajectories are described using values of invariant functions along them. By endowing the ergodic quotient with a Sobolev space metric structure, we are able to identify coherent sets: invariant subsets in the state space that possess a complete set of continuous invariant functions. These coherent sets correspond to continuous segments in the ergodic quotient. The ergodic quotient analysis is model-free: it requires only data obtained by simulation or through experiments. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented the algorithm as a numerical code that approximates the ergodic quotient using trajectory averages of a function basis on the state space. The geometry of the ergodic quotient is analyzed with help of a machine-learning algorithm, Diffusion Maps, which enables computational identification of continuous segments and, consequently, partitioning of the state space into coherent sets. To demonstrate effectiveness, several examples of dynamical systems were analyzed, ranging from iterated maps with mixed state spaces to forced fluid-like flows. The results obtained by the ergodic quotient analysis match the results of previous analyses of the systems. To conclude, further research directions are proposed, based on the results of the doctoral project.",,,
1521,How African American Students Define Leadership,"The intent of this study was to better understand the lived experiences of African American student leaders through the examination of their definitions, descriptions, and perceptions of leadership. Ten interviews of African American/Black student leaders were conducted that ranged between forty-five minutes and ninety minutes. The responses of the respondents were analyzed through utilization of a matrix comprised of Bolman and Deal's 4 frames, an additional frame by Scull, and Kouzes and Posner's 5 practices. The goal of using the matrix to analyze the students' responses was to capture the unique perceptions and experiences of these leaders in order to answer the following research questions. How do African American or Black college student leaders describe leadership? What values do African American or Black college student leaders perceive to be important to leadership? What do African American or Black college leaders perceive as the purpose of leadership? How do African American or Black college student leaders describe the knowledge, skills, and abilities they perceive to be necessary for effective leadership? The results of the study revealed that these student leaders focused on role modeling, building relationships, the sense of responsibility of being a leader, empowering the community, and service when describing leadership. In addition, the participants shared their evolution of identifying as a leader, the realization of their impact within the community as a leader, and them identifying that living on a cultural specific hall was a benefit to their leadership development. And although there are some limitations to the models in regards to specifically studying the African American/Black community, they proved useful overall in the analysis of the data.",,,
1522,Mechanistic studies of nucleation from solution,"Nucleation is the formation of a tiny embryo of a new phase out of an existing metastable phase. This process is vitally important to many natural systems and industries, including fine chemicals, food, dyes, pharmaceuticals, nonlinear optics elements, and explosives. Despite its ubiquity and importance, the nucleation process is not well understood. Nucleation is extremely difficult to study experimentally because it is a stochastic process occurring on the nano-scale in both time and space. As such, theoretical investigations, as well as molecular simulation, are crucial to understanding nucleation at the molecular level. Laser-induced nucleation Recent experiments have demonstrated that intense, nanosecond laser pulses can dramatically accelerate crystal nucleation from transparent solutions, a phenomenon termed nonphotochemical laser-induced nucleation (NPLIN). Previous work has proposed that this effect is due to the alignment of solute molecules in solution due to the electric field of the applied laser light, promoting crystalline order. We derive a new method of computing the diffusion coefficient along a reaction coordinate and apply this to previously proposed mechanisms for NPLIN. Our analysis shows that some current hypotheses about laser-induced nucleation mechanisms lead to a non-zero threshold laser pulse duration below which a laser pulse will not affect nucleation. We therefore propose experiments that might be used to test these hypotheses. We also note that the relationship that we derive has application not only to nucleation, but also to any system exhibiting diffusive crossing of a free energy barrier. We have also used simulations of NPLIN to examine how an orientational bias in solution (such as that proposed by the ""optical Kerr effect"") affects nucleation with Monte Carlo simulations of a Potts lattice gas model. We examine this effect within both a classical, one-step nucleation framework as well as in the context of two-step nucleation. Our results indicate that an orientational bias can reduce the free energy barrier to nucleation within the one-step picture, as well as promoting the crystallization of precritical nuclei (the rate-determining step in the two-step picture). However, these effects are only present with field strengths that are much greater than those used in experiments. We conclude that the optical Kerr effect is far too weak to explain the acceleration of crystal nucleation seen in NPLIN experiments. Experimentally, we demonstrate that laser pulses similar to those used in NPLIN experiments induce the nucleation of carbon dioxide bubbles from carbonated water. Enhanced alignment or attraction of CO2 molecules would not help facilitate bubble formation; thus previously proposed mechanisms for NPLIN cannot be at work. Additionally, in water that is co-supersaturated with argon and glycine, argon bubbles escaping from the water can induce crystal nucleation without a laser. The combined evidence suggests a possible unified theory for the mechanism of all laser-induced nucleation experiments: extremely small and transient bubbles may form in NPLIN experiments with unfocused lasers and catalyze crystal nucleation without being observed. Methane hydrates nucleation Clathrate hydrates are ice-like inclusion compounds of hydrophobic guest molecules. Clathrate hydrates of natural gases (""gas hydrates"") constitute the most abundant fossil fuel on the planet, and are thus an enormous potential resource of fossil energy. However, they also hinder the oil and natural gas industry by blocking pipelines and exacerbating oil well blowouts. They are also important to global climate change, gas transportation, and gas storage. The molecular mechanism by which these compounds form at conditions relevant to industry and nature remains a mystery. To understand the mechanism of methane hydrate nucleation from supersaturated aqueous solutions, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at controlled and realistic supersaturation. Utilizing direct MD results and classical nucleation theory (CNT), we find that critical nuclei are extremely large and that homogeneous nucleation rates are extremely slow. Our findings suggest that nucleation of methane hydrates at these realistic conditions cannot occur by a homogeneous mechanism.",,,
1523,"Towards an Operational Definition of Effective Co-Teaching: Instrument Development, Validity, and Reliability","This study focused on developing a valid and reliable instrument that can not only identify successful co-teaching, but also the professional development needs of co-teachers and their administrators in public schools. Two general questions about the quality of co-teaching were addressed in this study: (a) How well did descriptors within each of four hypothesized survey constructs interrelate and represent specific intended constructs? and (b) did differences in perception of co-teaching quality exist among various subgroups of teachers and administrators based on their roles and experiences regarding co-teaching? Factors that emerged from an exploratory factor analysis of a pilot study served as the main conceptual framework of this research. Based on review of the pattern of factor loadings and other technical analysis, the present survey was finalized. Revised items were then tested with 234 public school teachers. Findings revealed evidence supporting both reliability and validity of the survey instrument which was interpreted to support its use to inform future research on co-teaching. Reliability measures indicated an overall alpha of 0.95 for all 42 items; with alpha's ranging from 0.76 to 0.91 for the four factors. Validity measures were 0.84 for the Standardized Root Mean Residual and 0.95 for the Comparative Fit Index. In addition, insights gained through the analysis of differences among respondent subgroups were interpreted to suggest possible applications to inform professional development in co-teaching. In general differences across the groups suggest that the groups do not consistently agree upon what constitutes successful co-teaching.",,,
1524,Life to Likeness: Painting and Spectacle au vif in the Burgundian State,"In this dissertation I show how ties between Early Netherlandish painting and pageantry spectacles point to a distinct fifteenth-century conception of pictorial naturalism as figurative animation. In the fifteenth-century, painters were the primary designers of spectacles and the two media also shared patrons and a formal and critical vocabulary. Focusing on key artifacts and spectacles produced in the orbit of the influential Valois Burgundian ducal court between 1420 and 1478, I analyze the joint genesis, conception, and reception of painting and pageantry to argue that the proliferating interest in pictorial naturalism was driven by an ontological, rather than epistemological preoccupation. In Chapter I, ""Living Pictures,"" I focus on the Ghent Altarpiece and a 1420 Passion staging to retrace the Pygmalionesque-Promethean metaphor that governed the production and reception of Early Netherlandish painting. Drawing on period texts, I show that before 1550 the ubiquitous Middle French terms for pictorial naturalism apres le vif and au vif, regularly applied to both paintings and spectacles, denoted a painting brought to, rather than (as hitherto presumed) from, life. I then distinguish fifteenth-century conceptions of contact and verisimilitude from the modern concept of indexicality. Tying the animation metaphor to such discourses as medical alchemy, as well as to paradigmatic texts such as the Roman de la rose, I contextualize this trope within the broader period preoccupation with eschatology and agency. Chapter II, ""Painting Spectacle."" is concerned with painters' involvement in pageantry production. Analyzing accounting records---most closely a full set preserved from the 1468 Bruges wedding of Duke Charles the Bold with the English Princess Margaret of York---I establish that painters were the primary designers of stages, and, moreover, that patrons thought of stagecraft as painting. This medium indistinction evinces the somatic viewing experience encoded into imagery of both two- and three-dimensions in the fifteenth century, setting ontological equivalence as the inevitable conceptual horizon for naturalistic painting. In Chapter III, ""Making Histories,"" I trace connections between the 1478 theatricalized ducal baptism of Philip the Handsome in Bruges, contemporized paintings of sacred history, and ekphrastic historiography such as Christine de Pizan's 1403 Livre de la mutacion de fortune, to show that the epistemology of fifteenth-century imagery au vif was anchored in virtuous authorial agency rather than objectivity-connoting immediacy. Establishing that a preoccupation with the animation of the image, rather than any budding sensibility for immediacy or objectivity, shaped that crucial moment of resurging interest in pictorial naturalism, I decouple some of the first naturalistic easel paintings from the rise of the modern indexicality paradigm of naturalism. This dissertation thus effects a significant revision to the art-historical account of the transition from medieval to Renaissance painting.",,,
1526,Approximation Algorithms for Problems on Networks and Streams of Data,"In this dissertation we investigate approximation algorithms for problems defined on networks and streams of data. The unifying theme of all problems discussed is that finding an exact solution to them is impractical. Such impracticality may stem from a provable time complexity characterization in a general computation model, or it may be dictated by constraints on the resources available to the algorithm. The first problem concerns finding shortest paths in a network with time-variant transit times. We show that under minimal assumptions on the transit time functions, the complexity of the structure of the shortest paths between two network nodes over a time interval may overwhelm a decision maker; thus, it is crucial we devise strategies that approximate such structural complexity. Another problem on networks presented considers coloring a graph on n nodes with k colors in such a way that all colors are used roughly the same number of times and the number of edges connecting two nodes assigned to different colors is minimized. We prove that the problem is hard to approximate even when restricted to tree instances. Despite this result, we were able to devise efficient approximation algorithms for a relaxed version of the problem on general graphs. The second part of the dissertation studies problems on streams of data. In this model, a large stream of data is to be processed online using minimal time and memory per data item. These constraints are dictated by the restricted computational resources of the hardware processing the data, and by real time requirements. We first present a simple abstract framework for online approximation of time-series that yields a unified set of algorithms for the data stream model and other variations. Then, we implement our algorithms to solve the problem of identifying network traffic bursts at various and especially fine-grain time scales. The simplicity of our algorithmic framework allows our approximated burst detectors to be implemented directly in the operating system kernel or in constrained hardware such as routers.",,,
1527,Elliptic Curves with Complex Multiplication and Supersingular Primes,"This thesis explores the theory of elliptic curves with complex multiplication needed to prove Noam Elkies result that there are infinitely many supersingular primes for every elliptic curve defined over Q . The first chapter contains a brief overview of the basic theory of elliptic curves, including the topics of the j-invariant, isogenies, the endomorphism ring, the Tate module, elliptic curves over finite fields, good and bad reduction, and elliptic curves over C . In the second chapter we discuss elliptic curves defined over C with complex multiplication focusing on the action of the ring class group. In Chapter 3 we discuss the properties of the j-function and modular polynomials in order to prove that the j-invariants of elliptic curves with complex multiplication are algebraic integers and that these j-invariants generate ring class fields. In Chapter 4 we discuss ray class fields and give a brief summary of idelic class field theory in order to prove the main theorem of complex multiplication and some important results of Deuring. Finally in Chapter 5 we conclude with a proof that every elliptic curve defined over Q has infinitely many supersingular primes.",,,
1528,Biogeography of Aspen (Populus tremuloides) in North America: Inferring Climatic Niche Differentiation in North America's Most Widely Distributed Tree,"Populus tremuloides (Quaking Aspen) has the greatest range of any tree species in North America and is found throughout widely variable habitats. The occurrence of aspen in its habitats is partially driven by a suite of climatic characteristics whose means and extremes directly and indirectly affect the suitability of sites. These characteristics of climate under which aspen survive and thrive can be defined as its climatic niche. However, aspen populations in different regions may experience very different climates and have different phenotypes. Thus, for a species that is so widely distributed, how does one characterize its climatic niche? Do aspen inhabit one climatic niche, or several regional niches that could result in differences in genotype and phenotype? This thesis explores the similarities and differences of climatic niche for this species and how regionally, climatic niche may be different. Eastern and western climatic niche groupings were discovered with differences in potential evapotranspiration (PET), growing degree days (GDD), and mean annual precipitation (MAP). Time series analysis uncovered trends of increasing temperature minimums resulting in increasing GDD for western aspen since 1990. Differences between the eastern and western aspens' climatic niches may relate to clone size and structure as well as favored reproductive strategies and biotic interactions such as competition with other tree species that are not treated here. This work is a first step in quantifying differences in climatic niche for aspen in the lower 48 states and can advise how aspen may respond differently, by region, to climate changes.",,,
1529,"Chile, una nacion resquebrajada desde su inicio: la incipiente novela ""Cautiverio feliz del Mestre de Campo General Don Francisco Nunez de Pineda y Bascunan""","Chile is a fractured nation. Spanish/criollo and indigenous violence and division are the root of the nation's birth. Such is the essence this master's thesis distills from Cautiverio feliz (1673), a chronicle-novel written by Francisco Nunez de Pineda y Bascunan. His story begins with a battle with the indigenous. It unfolds as an eyewitness account of the warm hospitality given him while held in their captivity. This act of diplomacy was reflective of the harmonious indigenous social structure and attachment to the land. This memoir is also a portrait of the colonial regime's excesses and blunders. It was written long after the author / narrator / protagonist was released from captivity. Its time frame is set almost equidistantly between Chile's Conquest and Independence. This study reveals that in Cautiverio feliz (crafted as a letter to the king) Bascunan persuasively urges the Crown to stop both Spanish / criollo corruption and to end the protracted wars of conquest in the ""homeland of Chile"" (""patria Chille"" Cf:238). This century-long conflict instilled acrimony and injustice which forged a flawed sense of patriotism, thus failing to galvanize the Spanish empire's colonial project. Bascunan's expose is autobiography, chronicle, history and ethno-history; it is a strategic work of the imagination, ever-vigilant of the Inquisition's censorship, while modeled after the narrative and the poetic masterpieces of both Miguel de Cervantes and Alonso de Ercilla, respectively. It is -- arguably -- the first modernista novel in the Hispanic hemisphere. Cautiverio feliz identifies the military as a foundational institution bent on excluding the indigenous from participation in the national discourse. It memorializes the social upper stratum's land-based privileges connected to military credentials. The military's tentacles of power would hover over the civilian leadership, thundering its dismissal of the laws of the land and of an arduously fought for democracy by seizing government as a military dictatorship, thus instituting, instead, a repetitious pattern of violence which in the recent past deployed its force and atrocities toward its own people. A military vigilance of oligarchical interests rumbles even into the present. Bascunan yearns to become a member of this elite, albeit by the same means he abhors. This study recognizes Cautiverio feliz as a work of literature articulated to alter the course of colonial history and to create enduring institutions in Chile as well as across Hispanic America. ix.",,,
1530,Managing and Mining Biological Images,"The digital revolution in cellular and sub-cellular microscopy has had a remarkable effect on biological research. High throughput imaging technology has enabled the rapid acquisition of massive volumes of biological images. Sophisticated imaging methods are producing biological images of unprecedented detail and resolution. These advances have facilitated the capture of entire tissues, cell populations and even organs that were unimaginable until recently. The potential for significant scientific discovery from these large and detailed images is enormous. Yet many challenges remain in managing and mining these images in order to conduct biological inference. Biological images present unique computational problems that are rarely encountered in other image mining and management domains. Mining for patterns in tissue is often difficult due to the high density and heterogeneity of cells. Capturing biological processes from sensitive tissue at the limit of light resolution frequently produces noisy and poor quality images, resulting in a high degree of uncertainty of the underlying biology. These bio-image specific challenges have led to the emergence of a burgeoning new field, bio-image informatics, which aims to tackle the computational roadblocks to extracting biological knowledge from cellular and sub-cellular imaging. In this dissertation, I present my research on managing and mining uncertain biological images. I propose a method to quantify the spatial correlation between large, continuous structures and point objects, such as those found in the retina. Furthermore, I detail a model of spatial network creation and its application in biological tissue. Next, I present a novel algorithm to significantly improve the performance of searching for similar images or probability distributions in a biological database. Finally, I present image analysis work flow that incorporates image uncertainty in order to extract biological knowledge from images. While all of these methods are directly applied to biological tissues and images, they have broad applications in many other domains.",,,
1531,"Modeling, Design, and Fabrication of Carbon Nanostructures for Next-Generation Integrated Circuit Interconnects and Passive Devices","The semiconductor industry is confronting an acute problem in the interconnect area--as IC feature sizes continue to be scaled below 22 nm, Cu wires exhibit significant ""size effects"" resulting in a sharp rise in their resistivity, which in turn has adverse impact both on IC performance and reliability -- in the form of higher communication costs due to increased interconnect delays and chip-level power dissipation, as well as reduced current carrying capacity of the wires. Additionally, designing low-loss and high-quality passive structures becomes increasingly difficult for ultra high-frequency/RF or Terahertz applications. This dissertation explores the feasibility of using carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene as next-generation interconnects and passive devices to address some of the key performance, energy-efficiency and reliability challenges facing the IC industry--from modeling, design, as well as fabrication perspectives. On the modeling and design front, this dissertation presents the first and foremost attempt to build a compact circuit model for double/multi-walled CNT interconnects, based on which, the performance of CNT interconnects are analyzed and compared with that of Cu, showing the potential for 50% savings in both delay and power. We are also the first to theoretically illustrate that carbon based interconnects exhibit unique high-frequency behavior in the form of reduced skin effect, which shows great promise for designing low-loss ultra high-frequency interconnects/passive devices and circuits. Moreover, we propose a unique CNT based capacitor design that provides over 4X capacitance density than that required by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) for the year 2014. In addition, we provide the first comprehensive evaluation of CNT vias that are being heavily researched by the semiconductor R&D; community, and quantify their impact on the performance and thermal management of the back-end of the chip. En route, we bring forward the key process design requirements for CNT vias. On the fabrication front, this dissertation presents a novel process that, for the first time, enables fabrication of high-density, long (over 100 microns) and thick (up to microns) horizontally aligned CNT interconnects. The developed process not only yields horizontal CNT interconnects with the lowest reported resistivity, but also enables the first ever fabrication of a CNT based on-chip inductor. Finally, this dissertation includes a first-time study of electrostatic discharge characterization of few-layer graphene (relevant for both active and passive devices), and demonstrates the exceptional robustness of graphene with achieved current density as high as 4.6x108 A/ cm 2.",,,

Polymer and, more recently, small molecule organic compounds have shown promise to become economical in the bulk heterojunction architecture, but a deeper morphological and photophysical understanding is needed in order to maximize efficiencies. This thesis is aimed at characterizing organic bulk heterojunction devices through photoconductive atomic force microscopy as well as transient absorption spectroscopy in order to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms in which charge is generated.",,,
1533,Composition Context Photography,"In the digital point-and-shoot photography paradigm, users typically point the camera at the subjects, adjust framing, and trigger functions such as autofocus in preparation for taking a picture. This dissertation explores the opportunities for expanding the outcome of the point-and-shoot photography process by utilizing additional information collected while the user is framing a picture. We propose a novel framework for digital photography that explores contextual information gathered while a photographer is composing and framing a picture. We call the information given by a video taken from the camera's viewpoint while framing, accompanied by per-frame capture parameters and inertial sensor data, the composition context of a photograph. In practice, this video can be recorded by saving the images displayed at the viewfinder during framing. We started our investigation by conducting an exploratory study with users to gather composition context data in real-world photographic situations. In the study, we collected a large database of pictures with associated composition context data. An analysis of this dataset confirms that a significant portion of the composition context is highly correlated with the picture taken. In other words, part of the composition context can be understood as imaging the same scene pictured in the photograph with variations in capture parameters, such as field of view, exposure time, and focus. By exploring this correlation and variability, we then show how computer vision and computational photography techniques can be applied to provide a wide range of interesting and compelling photo suggestions as a result of the picture-taking process. These include image composites, such as panoramas and high dynamic range images, and individual frames selected from the composition context. We demonstrate that our framework can be integrated into new camera functionality. A ""composition context camera"" preserves the interface of current point-and-shoot cameras, but it uses the information in the composition context to compute additional interesting photo choices. We expect this capability to expand the photographic possibilities for casual and amateur users, who often rely on automatic camera modes.",,,

1535,Inculcating Instrumentality: How Socioeconomic Status and School Context Impact Eighth Graders' Attitudes toward Math and Science,"In an era of declining social mobility and growing demand for scientific and technical workers, understanding the process by which students come to pursue mathematics and science programs should be of great concern to governments, employers, and scholars of social inequality. It is long established that socioeconomic background affects educational outcomes and that these class effects operate in part by affecting students' attitudes and aspirations. The present investigation uses data on U.S-American eighth-graders and their schools to explore effects on attitudes of socioeconomic status (SES) measured at the family and school levels. Consistent with previous research pointing to more practical, ""instrumental"" curricular choices by students from less privileged backgrounds, results show that students from lower-SES families hold more positive attitudes toward math. But multilevel analyses reveal that these attitudes are better predicted by school- than family-level SES. Students in lower-income schools hold more positive attitudes toward math and science regardless of family SES and regardless of individual achievement. The effect of attending a low-income school on affinity for math is especially strong for girls. Findings support arguments suggesting broader cultural effects of affluence on attitudes and aspirations.",,,
1536,Combinatorial and Geometric Optimization over Stochastic Data,"Inexpensive and ubiquitous access to data on massive scales is having a profound and transformative impact on most scientific disciplines. In particular, data-driven computational models bring insights into complex phenomena ranging from genetic mutations to urban traffic patterns, social dynamics, ecological changes, etc. In fact, data are available in such an abundance today that the critical bottleneck has shifted to ""analytics"": algorithms that can make sense of these data. Apart from the obvious difficulties brought by the massive volumes of these data, a major challenge in data analytics is the inevitable presence of uncertainty. Most natural and social systems are highly unpredictable, and man-made systems are often fallible: devices fail and bonds break unexpectedly, and a myriad of confounding variables can only be accounted for through statistical means. Apart from such inherent randomness, measurement and recording tools are rarely perfect: be it a GPS trace, a LiDAR scan, a medical image, or a biological recording, the data we obtain are often entangled with noise, error, and uncertainty, and a stochastic framework is the only meaningful way to process it. In computer science and mathematical optimization, a number of models and approaches have been considered to account for, and analyze the effect of uncertainty: random graphs, stochastic geometry, Bayesian analysis, and multi-stage stochastic optimization being some prominent examples. Most of the classical random models focus on asymptotic results on random point sets or random graphs, while much of the current research on stochastic optimization is focused on two-stage models, where one trades the current uncertainty with future price inflation. In short, most of these models and techniques are either too abstract or too application-specific, and there remains a need for basic, general models and algorithms that can be adapted to a broader class of applications. In this dissertation, we revisit several classical problems under an uncertainty-aware lens, i.e., with the assumption that the input data is only probabilistically available to the algorithm. We study how the stochasticity of input data affects the complexity of basic combinatorial and geometric structures such as minimum spanning trees, nearest neighbors, and traveling salesman tours, proposing several hardness results and approximation algorithms for such problems. Besides developing a fundamental theory, we also discuss some real-world applications that benefit from this theory.",,,
1537,"Average Joes and Mean Girls: The Representation and Transformation of the Average American, 1890--1945","This dissertation investigates the depiction of the ""average American,"" a statistical and visual trope that carried significant ideological weight at the end of the nineteenth century and in the first half of the twentieth century. On a symmetrical bell curve, the most aberrant representative data ground the curve to its horizontal axis, while the average is located at its central peak The center of the bell curve was a late nineteenth- and twentieth-century obsession, especially in the United States, where immigration, economic instability, and swift modernization made it seem ever more urgent to understand the nation's diverse population in ""objective"" terms. This dissertation examines how the average American---as determined by both statistical and anthropological models---was represented in sculpture. I trace the scientific and artistic trajectories of three sets of sculptures, a male and female figure commissioned by Dudley Allen Sargent from Henry Hudson Kitson and Theo Alice Ruggles to represent the average American man and woman at the Chicago's Columbian Exposition in 1893, the Races of Mankind exhibit commissioned by Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History from Malvina Hoffman which opened in 1933, and Norma and Normman, commission by Robert Latou Dickinson from Abram Belskie and which were put on display at the Cleveland Health Museum in 1945. These sculptures were meant to be seen by large audiences in public spaces, and were primarily didactic objects intended to promote physical, racial, and sexual fitness.and contributed to statistical imaginary of the interwar years. I argue that such representations derived their authority from their scientific aura and were an effective way to construct an imagined community blissfully unchallenged by diversity and difference. These sculptures were based explicitly on data compiled by large-scale statistical or anthropological projects. They were all meant to be seen by large audiences in public spaces (world's fairs, natural history museums, health museums) and were primarily didactic objects intended to promote physical, racial, and sexual fitness. Such representations derived their authority from their scientific and their artistic aura and were used as tools to develop a specific kind of public, while simultaneously discouraging the formation of others. They were effective ways by which to formulate and fix an imagined community in which the challenges of diversity and difference could be tamed if not fantasized away entirely.",,,
1538,Imitatio Christi: Reading Early Christian Martyrdom as Self-Formation,"Martyrdom has traditionally been understood as an act of self-sacrifice. Within Christianity, self-sacrificial martyrdom is described as imitation of Christ and upheld as a model of Christian behavior. This presents two problems. First, it subsumes all martyrdoms under this logic of sacrifice, thus effacing the potential difference of the martyr. Second and more importantly, it fails to explain why most Christians have not been martyrs. To challenge this understanding, I examine martyrdom as an act of self-formation. First, I suggest the obvious but overlooked point that the martyr's death is the only measurable qualitative difference between the martyr and those who remain and provides the impetus for post-mortem appropriation. Using the language of existential theory, I represent the martyr as autothanatos, a term that emphasizes the volitional, autonomous death as the foundational component of the martyr's self-identification. Second, I examine the chronological development of early Christian martyrdom through the autothanatos to suggest that martyrdom could only contribute to the ""triumph"" of Christianity through an appropriation of the martyr's autonomy for the burgeoning Christian institution. The act of the martyr could not, as Tertullian suggested, be ""the seed of the Church"" without modification. I represent that modification as an historical shift in relationship to the martyr (and Christ) from imitatio to veneratio. This alteration, as I contend in the third part of this work, established a relationship to violence and death that is still operative. The authoritative, selective identification of violence in the present obscures this intimate relationship, facilitating the individual's denial of death and the institution's justification of violence. Through connecting ancient understandings of martyrdom and modern acts of violence, particularly in a religious context, I provide an alternative understanding of the importance of martyrdom to Christianity and the Western tradition. Further, by showing its continued functionality, I indicate the ubiquity of violence in our political calculation and suggest frank realization of this ubiquity as a necessary component for egalitarian religious dialogue.",,,
1539,Expeditions in Neurocartography: Mappings between Structural and Functional Pathways in Artificial and Cognitive Neural Systems,"Neural systems are inherently complex and dynamic in nature, exhibiting a vast array of functions that range from low-level cellular interactions to high-level cognitive processes. These functions are supported by anatomical interactions that span a similarly wide range of scales, from the synapses between individual neurons to the extended fiber pathways that traverse the brain. Both this structural architecture and the function that it supports are continually interacting with and adapting to the external environment. An understanding of both the capabilities and limitations of neural systems therefore requires integrative approaches for assessing interactions between structural architecture, dynamic functional activity, and environmental variability. In this dissertation, we apply theoretical, computational, and data-driven techniques to the study of both artificial and cognitive neural systems with the goal of mapping between patterns of structural and functional connectivity across multiple scales of resolution. Theoretical and computational analyses of small artificial networks provide insight into the limitations of different architectural motifs in facilitating the performance of low-level functions, while data-driven analyses of large-scale human brain networks provide insight the overlap of high-level functions supported by a common structural architecture. Computational neural networks provide a powerful framework in which to systematically probe the dependence of system function on underlying architecture. We use neural networks to assess the dependence of competitive learning and memory processes on structural variations. By comparing the performance of parallel and layered network architectures during sequential tasks that require both acquisition and retention of information, we identify tradeoffs between learning and memory processes that arise from variations in underlying structure. During the task of supervised, sequential function approximation, networks produce and adapt representations of external information. Performance is evaluated by statistically analyzing the error in these representations while varying the initial network state, the structure of the external information, and the time given to learn the information. The structure of the underlying error landscape connects functional network performance to complexity in network architecture. We employ sloppy model analysis {Brown2003} of parallel and layered network landscape minima to isolate variations in the number, curvature, and eigenvector localization properties of local minima within different network landscapes. We find that these variations in landscape structure give rise to tradeoffs in performance; these include the ability of the network to maximize accuracy versus minimize inaccuracy and produce specific versus generalizable representations of information. Parallel networks generate smooth error landscapes with deep, narrow minima, enabling them to find highly specific representations given sufficient time. While accurate, however, these representations are difficult to generalize. In contrast, layered networks generate rough error landscapes with a variety of local minima, allowing them to quickly find coarse representations. Although less accurate, these representations are easily adaptable. Importantly, the systematic analysis of performance in small neural network models provides insight into the performance of larger composite systems in which statistical analyses of performance would be intractable. Furthermore, the finding that variations in parallel versus layered network architectures give rise to measurable performance tradeoffs has implications for understanding the behavior of a wide variety of natural and artificial learning systems that share these structural features. Given that the statistical analysis of computational network performance can inform large-scale models of neural systems, we similarly ask to what extent the data-driven study of the brain can in turn inform computational models of network function. Magnetic resonance imaging enables the noninvasive mapping of both anatomical white matter connectivity and dynamic patterns of neural activity in the human brain. We examine the relationship between the structural properties of white matter tracts (structural connectivity) and the functional properties of correlations in neural activity (functional connectivity) within 84 healthy human subjects both at rest and during the performance of attention- and memory-demanding tasks. We show that structural properties, including the length, number, and spatial location of white matter tracts, are predictive of and can be inferred from the strength of resting-state and task-based functional interaction between brain regions. Importantly, we show that these relationships are both representative of the entire set of subjects and consistently observed within individual subjects. The observed links between structural and functional pathways in the human brain provide insight into the development of large-scale neural architecture and the functional implications of disruptions to this architecture. This direct analysis of connectivity uncovers relationships between structural and functional interactions without invoking knowledge of the specific brain regions involved in these interactions. By incorporating this additional knowledge into our analysis, we identify structurally-mediated interactions between putative task-related functional networks that both support and distinguish between cognitive states. We build upon previous studies that have identified resting-state functional networks, denoted task-positive (TP) and task-negative (TN) networks, that are strongly anticorrelated at rest but also involve regions of the brain that routinely increase and decrease in activity during attention processes, suggesting that task-based function is encoded in resting-state activity. By identifying regions within our brain networks that have been implicated in TP and TN networks, we investigate the structural mechanisms that support a functional overlap between resting-state and task-driven activity. We show that strong interactions within and between TP and TN networks, as quantified by an increase in the relative number of anatomical connections that support strong functional correlations, distinguish resting-state, attention-state, and memory-state brain activity. We map differences in these interactions to a phase-like space in which brain states are characterized by the relative contribution from different network interactions. We probe the features of this phase space across subjects and find sets of ordered relationships between cognitive states. This order enables us to group individual based on their similarity in phase space, and we link groupings with abnormal phase relationships to significant deviations in behavioral performance during attention and memory tasks. This suggests that further characterization of this phase space may help identify structural and functional signatures of altered cognitive states. Together, these findings uncover robust links between structural architecture and functional activity in small-scale artificial network models and in large-scale human brain networks, which together inform and constrain intermediate-level descriptions of structural and functional interactions. The development of integrative, multiscale descriptions of neural system architecture is crucial for understanding both the capabilities and the constraints imposed by this architecture.",,,
1540,The Politics of Spectacle: Ideology and Ambition in Jacobean Court Ceremonies,"Historians and literary scholars now recognize and build upon the insights they offer each other in understanding early modern political and literary culture by relying on sources and methodologies previously considered separate domains. This dissertation furthers this interdisciplinary methodology through an analysis of the significant Jacobean court ceremonies and their accompanying festivities from roughly 1603 to 1613. These major events of state usually entailed the production and publication of religious and literary works and descriptions of the ceremonies which expressed various attempts to define the significance of the event. It is argued here that the significance and meaning of Jacobean ceremonies were deeply contested along political, religious, and ideological lines. During James's coronation, John Whitgift and Thomas Bilson urged the king to protect episcopacy in England at the same time they disagreed with each other on the nature of the Church of England. Despite earlier interpretations, Henry's investiture as Prince of Wales, Ben Jonson's Prince Henries Barriers, and Samuel Daniel's Tethys Festival reflected a temporary alignment of James's political goals and Henry's ideology. Daniel Price delivered six sermons before the court in the month between the prince's death and his funeral that argued for the continued importance of the protestant cause ideology, denounced the ascendancy of the crypto-Catholic Howard faction, and decried the appearance an anti-Calvinist strain of theology in the universities. At the marriage of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick, elector Palatine, Thomas Campion's Lords Maske called attention to James's intentions for the marriage, while John King's sermon pointed to the dangers of a Catholic union and highlighted a protestant cause interpretation of the event. Both George Chapman's Memorable Masque and Francis Beaumont's Masque of the Inner Temple also linked the wedding to the protestant cause ideology, but Chapman expressed concerns about James's fiscal policies and the rise of court favorite Robert Carr, Viscount Rochester. Finally, Anthony Maxey closed the week-long celebration with a Lenten sermon that espoused an anti-Calvinist ideology, exposing precisely the sort of ""threat"" warned against by Price and King.",,,
1541,Real-Time Meta-Programming for Interactive Computational Arts,"In the interactive computer arts, any advance that significantly amplifies or extends the limits and capacities of software can enable genuinely novel aesthetic experiences. Within compute-intensive media arts, flexibility is often sacrificed for needs of efficiency, through the total separation of machine code optimization and run-time execution. Compromises based on modular run-time combinations of prior-optimized 'black box' components confine results to a pre-defined palette with less computational efficiency overall: limiting the open-endedness of development environments and the generative scope of artworks. This dissertation demonstrates how the trade-off between flexibility and efficiency can be relaxed using reflective meta-programming and dynamic compilation: extending a program with new efficient routines while it runs. It promises benefits of more open-ended real-time systems, more complex algorithms, richer media, and ultimately unprecedented aesthetic experiences. The dissertation charts the significant differences that this approach implies for interactive computational arts, builds a conceptual framework of techniques and requirements to respond to its challenges, and documents supporting implementations in two specific scenarios. The first concentrates on open-ended creativity support within always-on authoring environments for studio work and live coding performance, while the second concerns the open-endedness of generative art through interactive, immersive artificial-life worlds.",,,
1542,A natural systems analysis of eye movements for face recognition,"Humans often look toward the eyes when viewing another face. While this behavior is known to carry significant social value in many cultures, its functional role in basic perceptual tasks remains unclear. Here, three studies explore a sensory optimization hypothesis of face recognition eye movement behavior: Observed human eye movements during face recognition reflect the brain's ability to learn optimized fixation strategies for the task-specific statistical distribution of information across the human face combined with the foveated nature of the visual system. In the first study, eye movements were recorded during three common face-related tasks: identification, emotion recognition, and gender discrimination. On average, humans looked toward the middle of the face and slightly displaced downward from the eyes. Next, a novel forced-fixation paradigm was used to show that the choice of fixation has functional consequences. A model is then developed, the foveated ideal observer, that simulates the decreasing acuity and sensitivity of the visual system in the periphery. Simulations show that humans' preferred points of fixation are consistent with a performance-maximizing eye movement strategy. The second study explores inter-individual variability in eye movement behavior. It is shown that individuals who tend to look away from the group-optimal point of fixation do not experience performance detriments. Instead, each individual enacts an idiosyncratic eye movement strategy that leads to maximal performance for their own visual system. The third study investigates one possible mechanism by which humans might learn to optimize their eye movement strategies for face recognition. A major component of formulating an optimal strategy is knowledge of the statistical distribution of discriminating information. Here, novel faces with odd spatial distributions of information were learned by humans. This learning was fast, and revealed an initial bias towards features (e.g., the eyes) that carry high information content in natural faces. Taken together, these studies describe how two major neural networks, the face recognition and eye movement systems, work in concert to learn and enact strategies optimized for the computationally challenging visual tasks associated with faces.",,,
1543,Mechanics and Patterning in Metazoan Epithelia,"In this dissertation we consider the effect of mechanical interactions on cell biology and how this translates into tissue-level properties in metazoan epithelia. We delineate three model-based approaches with different phenomenological aims and compare applicable results to experimental data. We first consider cellular vertex model simulations, which are used to represent the mechanics of two-dimensional epithelial cell arrays. We outline the assumptions, parameters, and outputs. Then we review a number of systems in which these simulations have been used. The second approach is the Mechanical Inverse, which is a vertex model-based approach to inferring mechanical stresses from cell boundary labeled images of epithelial tissue. We develop this inference method from the assumption of mechanical equilibrium and dominant stresses in the tissue. We then apply this computational method to experimental images and validate the performance. In the final part we consider avian cochlea development in epithelia where lateral inhibition plays a role in cell differentiation---a process which involves cell division, differentiation, and rearrangement in a two-dimensional epithelial layer. We develop a mean-field mathematical description of this process. The results provide a description of the observed hair cell patterns in the cochlea.",,,
1544,Improving Validation Coverage Metrics to Account for Limited Observability,"In both pre-silicon and post-silicon validation, the detection of design errors requires both stimulus capable of activating the errors and checkers capable of detecting the behavior as erroneous. Most functional and code coverage metrics evaluate only the activation component of the testbench and ignore propagation and detection. In this document, we describe our innovations in developing improved metrics that account for propagation and/or detection of design errors. These techniques represent a significant improvement to the validation process, which for years has been the dominant portion of chip design costs. Their application can reduce both the computational complexity as well as the manual effort required for validation, all while facilitating a higher standard of quality than previous methods.",,,
1545,Homoerotismo literario: El punto de encuentro de la gaydad mexicana,"This dissertation explores the spaces of entertainment (cruising zones) that serve as a place for the homosexual characters to exist/interact with others (similar or/and different), and have a life that is still not possible in the dominant society. While the characters coexist in these kinds of zones, they transform environment and places to their advantage. I discuss the value of all the different types of spaces in the formation of the personal/collective and cultural identity of the protagonists. These significant places serve as a tool for the characters to manipulate their disadvantages they have in a repressive society. In this work, I present an analysis of four Mexican novels: Los 41: una novela critico social (1906) by Eduardo A. Castrejon (seud.), El diario de Jose Toledo (1964) by Miguel Barbachano Ponce, El vampiro de la colonia Roma (1979) by Luis Zapata and Las puberes caneforas (1983) by Jose Joaquin Blanco. The texts narrate the story of homosexual characters in Mexico City and their personal and collective experience with the spaces of entertainment and sexual expressions in the urban setting.",,,
1546,"Spirit Messengers, Divine Encounters: Practitioner Inhabitants of the Anlo-Ewe Spirit World","The dissertation is an anthropological study utilizing oral narrative, archival history, and sociological methods to examine the question of how the Anlo-Ewe people experience the divine and how these perceived human-divine relations affect 1) formation of identity, 2) community relationships, and 3) vocational selection and decision-making processes. The secondary question of the study explores the effects of globalization, technological advancement, and Christianization on 'traditional' Anlo-Ewe practices and community dynamics in southeastern Ghana. How the Anlo-Ewe spirit world influences, engages, and interconnects its practitioners is determined through examining the functions and structure of the Anlo-Ewe cosmological order; identifying the religio-social role of artists, mediums, diviners, and priestesses as spirit messengers; and interpreting the process and outcome of practitioners experiencing vodu, or divinity, individually and communally. Research was compiled from: court records, colonial documents, first-hand narratives and secondary resources; experiential data gathered from interviews with Christian and Anlo-Ewe Vodu practitioners; attendance at private initiation and community rites, public ceremonies, religious services, and funerals; and living at family compounds in Klikor, Nogokpo and Denu and at a shrine for priestesses-in-training in Ghana's Ketu South District. Findings show that indigenous practices are decreasing as western forms of Christian-influenced education are becoming more readily prescribed and available to school-age children. Anlo-Ewe services, community rites, and priestly schedules are being amended to match increasing global material access, technological advancement, and community expectations of the shifting perspectives of time. Constructions of identity, vocational and marital selection, and community relationships are likewise struggling between models of intra-community, or extended familial responsibility, and models based on the nuclear family or self-interest as primary, often shifting from localized expectations of economic and social interrelationship to a more protracted conception of personhood involving individualization, accusations of witchcraft, and capitalist models of success. The Vodu pantheon has adapted and transformed to match social experience: times of community upheaval invite greater numbers of personalized spirits adopted for individual means above collective purposes. Experiential elements of bodily engagement with divinity (vodu), via dreams, divination, possession, community ceremony and initiation, remain vital to the stability of local community practices and perceptions of social cohesiveness.",,,
1547,"Beyond simple relations: Mining and search in temporal, composite and semantic graphs","The current ""Big Data"" boom coincides with the realization that data entities across systems are not independent. In order to allow realistic discovery in many domains like natural sciences, on-line social systems and media, transportation and economics, one needs to consider their underlying networks. Graphs and corresponding mining and analysis algorithms provide a powerful framework for analysis of big networked data. All graph application domains, however, include more facets than simply binary relations among entities. Networks may (i) evolve over time; (ii) incorporate multiple layers; and (iii) exhibit special node/edge semantics such as collaboration compatibility, opposition/agreement and others. While, taking such rich information into account allows for more realistic analysis and mining for characteristic domain phenomena, it also introduces novel computational challenges. In this thesis, I develop methods for mining and search in large graphs that observe temporal evolution of edge/node values, multi-type edges or special semantics of tie strength. In the area of temporal networks, I introduce the problem of the heaviest dynamic subgraph and corresponding mining methods that scale to large real world instances. I consider composite networks for function prediction in biology and multi-criteria proximity search in social and information multi-mode networks. I employ signed and labeled relations to study agreement and disagreement and for mining group effectiveness in collaboration networks. The urgent need to incorporate such rich information in graph analysis and mining is the commonality among the above three directions in my thesis. My primary focus in every chapter is on algorithms that scale to real-world networks and simultaneously maintain high quality of the obtained results. Overall, I propose core mining and search algorithms that extend the current state of the art in computer science research. The utility of rich network information such as time, multi-modality and special semantics acts as a unifying theme in all chapters and across the various applications domains including, but not limited to, bioinformatics, communication graphs, social networks and media, collaboration and effectiveness of teams, sensor networks, and transportation networks.",,,
1548,Niche theory and the persistence of populations: applications to competitive communities and an infectious disease,"How a population's size changes near an absorbing boundary---a threshold, often extinction, from which the population cannot recover---has long been a fixture of ecological theory. Asking whether a small population can invade a resident community, rather than go extinct, is one way to study the ecological mechanisms that maintain biodiversity. Escaping extinction, or any absorbing boundary, is not a black and white matter: some populations go quick, others slow, and all have some probability of being absorbed. The variation in these rates or probabilities may have lasting implications for each population and relate to the nature of the ecological community composed of these populations. I define in a precise way two kinds of variation between species---niche differences, which promote coexistence, and relative fitness differences, which promote competitive exclusion---that depend on the growth rates of small populations invading established communities. In a classic deterministic model of consumer-resource competition, the magnitude of niche and fitness differences are both necessary to understand a relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem-function. In a novel model of a competitive community that includes demographic stochasticity, the variation among species introduced by niche and fitness differences produces dynamics that quickly diverge from predictions of the ""neutral theory of biodiversity"", while some static properties can remain unaffected. The tools for modeling stochastic population dynamics yield a precise way of calculating the probability that a population fails to escape an absorbing boundary, and this translates into knowledge of the mean time a population persists. In a model of the stochastic infection process for a disease of amphibians, the expected lifetime of an adult host shows little sensitivity to the initial proximity of the pathogen's abundance to its lethal threshold.",,,
1549,"Land succession and intensification in the agricultural frontier: Sierra del Lacandon National Park, Guatemala","This study investigates land cover change and land ownership turnover in an area that is a priority conservation zone, the Sierra del Lacandon National Park (SLNP), Peten, Guatemala. Migration to Peten since the 1950s has eliminated 60% of Peten's forests. Migration to the SLNP peaked in the 1990s and population growth continues. This study analyzes panel-data consisting of household interviews conducted with farmers living in the SLNP or its buffer zone in 1998 and 2009. I examined household survey data previously collected during interviews conducted in 1998 with 247 subsistence farmers in eight communities. In 2009 I reinterviewed the same households when present. Additionally, I interviewed the new owners of land that had belonged to the 1998 interviewees, and a cross-sectional sample of 213 randomly selected households. Surveys were primarily quantitative, with some open-ended qualitative questions. I ran continuous regressions examining changes in land cover for households who remained in the area between the two dates. I also ran logistic regressions examining which 1998 landholding households had sold their land by 2009. The overall trend is towards deintensification of agriculture. On average, households crop larger areas of higher value crops and less maize, but these changes have not kept pace with the expansion of pasture. The area is simultaneously experiencing farm parcel consolidation and splintering. Half of the landowning households in 1998 sold their land by 2009, some to large landholders. The most commonly cited reason for a household to sell its land is for payments related to a medical emergency or debt. Early adopters of cattle and higher value crops were less likely to have sold their land by 2009. As in much of the lowland tropics of Latin America, pasture dominates the landscape. These findings illustrate that in areas of weak grain and produce markets, many households with the means to produce beyond basic subsistence will turn to cattle. In conservation areas of Latin America, park administrators would be advised to invest in developing land use alternatives to cattle, such as non-timber forest products.",,,
1550,Accounting for Adverse Selection in Loan and Insurance Markets,"Many financial products have state-contingent returns, with the probabilities of these states varying according to the buyer. In the case of loans, some borrowers are more likely to pay than others. It is up to the lender to decide if multiple contracts for different types of borrowers is incentive compatible, and profitable. The first chapter finds that small, uncollateralized loans, like those given by microfinance firms, can be profitable if they are accompanied by a high interest rate. As more collateral is pledged, loan sizes increase, and interest rates fall. The second chapter asks if adverse selection can account for the thin annuity market. Annuitants tend to be longer-lived than their non-annuitized counterparts, driving up the price on annuities. The model predicts a spike in annuity returns after age 80, accounting for the delay in annuitization by many retirees. The third chapter shows that adverse selection in the annuity market can create demand for employer-provided pensions. When all workers are pooled with the same contract, adverse selection is not a problem, and workers can earn a higher return on their retirement savings. It goes on to show that labor market conditions can explain a large part of the movement away from employer-provided defined benefit pensions.",,,
1551,Optically trapped fluorescent nanodiamonds,"The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in diamond is gaining significant interest for applications in nanoscale sensing. The optical addressability of the magnetically sensitive spin states and the ability to coherently control these states at room temperature makes this system an exciting candidate for spin-based magnetometry. I constructed an optical tweezers apparatus combined with a confocal fluorescence apparatus. Using the optical apparatus, we demonstrate three-dimensional position control of nanodiamonds in solution with simultaneous readout of ground-state electron-spin resonance (ESR) transitions in an ensemble of diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers. Despite the motion and random orientation of NV centers suspended in the optical trap, we observe distinct peaks in the measured ESR spectra qualitatively similar to the same measurement in bulk. Accounting for the random dynamics, we model the ESR spectra observed in an externally applied magnetic field to enable dc magnetometry in solution. We estimate the dc magnetic field sensitivity based on variations in ESR line shapes to be approximately 45 microTesla/Hz_. This technique may provide a pathway for spin-based magnetic, electric, and thermal sensing in fluidic environments and biophysical systems inaccessible to existing scanning probe techniques.",,,
1552,An exploratory investigation into the key elements associated with district-wide improvement,"Faced with expectations to improve student learning and increasing student alternatives, school districts are challenged to make system-wide and sustainable improvement in student learning outcomes. The national accountability movement is associated with a growing body of research that has considered the role of the district to influence student outcomes throughout the system. This study sought to identify differences in the presence and impact of three research-based district-reform factors: the district instructional vision, the commitment and capacity to enact the vision, and the use of a multi-level data system as a means of providing feedback on progress towards the vision. Additionally, the study sought to identify differences in perceived impact on site leadership capacity and teacher self-efficacy and job satisfaction. An exploratory comparative case study methodology was employed using an online survey and semi-structured interviews to collect and analyze data on eighteen variables. Two California unified school districts were compared based on differences in district-wide student improvement rates on annual testing. An exploratory factor analysis identified a set of empirically-based factors consisting of district-based initiative and actions, site-based instructional decision making and, site leadership associated with the survey providing an alternate perspective to organize data while offering an additional lens to consider the impact of the research-based factors. Total population and two within-group samples were compared between districts. Findings surfaced differences in perceptions and actions of district-wide staff associated with district vision, commitment and capacity building, data use, and site leadership variables. No differences were found in the presence of teacher self-efficacy and job satisfaction between the two districts. While limited in their generalizability, the results appear to point out the influence of a district instructional vision on district commitment, professional development, and site leadership. Topics for further research include the impact of district instructional vision on high school reform efforts, on large urban school districts, and influences of the school district community in establishing and maintaining an instructional vision. The study concludes by offering implications for practice associated with district-wide student outcome improvements.",,,
1553,"Stravinsky's Concerto for Piano and Winds (1924): Metrical Displacement, Tonal Distortion and the Composer as Performer","Stravinsky's dogmatic approach to performance practice focuses on a metrically-strict style that attempts to eliminate expressive devices by the performer. He even referred to performers as ""executants"" in order to emphasize a rigid manner of execution over individual interpretation. Stravinsky established the executant-style requirements in contemporary discourse, but more importantly, during his ten-year career as solo pianist in performances of the neoclassical Concerto for Piano and Winds (1924). Reviews of the Concerto appropriated the composer's objectivist language and helped to institute the modernist lexicon; but the reviews also illustrate a conflict between the ostensibly non-emotional principles and the vibrant performances listeners actually experienced. This study attempts to reconcile the executant-style of performance with an emotional experience triggered by disruptive elements of structure. I investigate reception from the European and American premieres (1924-25) of the Concerto featuring Stravinsky as pianist, as a way to illustrate his enormous influence on contemporary discourse and performance practice. An analytic approach of the Concerto will illustrate disruptive elements, namely, the phrasal and harmonic irregularity caused by metrical displacement and tonal distortion. I will extract anti-metrical layers caused by metrical displacement to highlight phrasal irregularity; and through a pitch-reductive process, will reveal unconventional contrapuntal frameworks to illustrate how Stravinsky's music references tonal gestures but is ultimately unable to sustain harmonic prolongation. This analysis exemplifies the surface-oriented nature of Stravinsky's music which has perceptual implications for performance. Although the executant-style of performance appears to correspond to modern objectivist esthetics, Pieter van den Toorn states that metrical precision in the performance practice of Stravinsky's music is motivated by structure, specifically, to maximally highlight irregular changes in alignment due to metrical displacement. I propose that disruptive elements of structure in fact generate the executant-style; in other words, performers will counter a highly irregular surface with a highly regular execution. This is because Stravinsky's disruptive surface lacks the structure to systematically elicit expressive devices and therefore, will curtail the performer's impulse to slow down. In spite of the criticism that the executant-style reduces the performer to little more than an automaton, I suggest that disruption produces a highly-attentive state in the performer which I consider to be an emotional experience.",,,
1554,"The Implications of Reforming Agricultural Input-Subsidies for More Holistic Rural Development: A Case Study of Punjab, India","Through the context of the Punjabi agricultural development experience, this thesis examines the social, political, and economic implications of reforming India's current input subsidization strategy for agricultural developments. I conclude that changes are needed to allow for diversification in Punjab's agricultural sector and larger economy. Environmental, social and economic sustainability were not prioritized at the onset of the green revolution in Punjab and the adverse effects of input subsidies on the state exemplify this fact. Environmental degradation, human health complications, and fiscal deficits are visible in Punjab. Punjab has been the beneficiary of significant public investment funds for agriculture, allowing the state to become a cereal production powerhouse. Recently, however, the economic and agricultural growth enjoyed in Punjab has begun to stagnate, and may potentially be in decline, as continued input subsidization limits incentive for diversification. The prioritization of the agricultural sector of the economy has led to limited growth in the secondary and tertiary sectors where further diversification could allow for more non-farm employment opportunities. Changes to the state agricultural support structure were limited during the reform period of the 1990's, but a reduction in input subsidies could allow more holistic and equitable rural development in India by shifting government funds toward investment in education, infrastructure, and agricultural research and development. Ultimately, a gradual reduction of input subsidies, coupled with the utilization and enforcement of minimum support prices, could lead to more diversification within the agricultural sector. Agricultural extension services through the Punjab Agricultural University need to be highly engaged in the transitional period to inform farmers of their options for diversification. The fiscal savings realized through a reduction in input subsidies could allow for government investment in long term growth, improving urban and rural Punjabi livelihoods and could serve as a case study for burgeoning African nations to follow.",,,
1555,Investigations of Phase Instabilities and Many---Body Physics in Charge---Stabilized Colloidal Dispersions,"Neutron scattering experiments involving low ionic strength polyelectrolyte solutions in the absence of added salt show a steep upturn in scattering profile in the low angle limit. This steep upturn at low q appears to be a general feature for highly-charged systems, such as polyelectrolytes, colloids, and vesicles, and may be the result of fluctuations around an unrealized critical point. We investigate a toy model of a solution of charged colloids in the restricted primitive model with multiple geometries. Linear mean-field analysis of the salt-free system indicates a region of instability, though this region may exist beyond the realm of validity of the linear theory. Nonlinear effects absent from the linear theory result in the condensation of counterions to the surface of the macroion, possibly keeping the system in a regime where linearization is appropriate as well as providing a mechanism for correlations induced by fluctuations of the surface charge density. In order to investigate this system further we implement Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the full interactions beyond the linear theory. The algorithm developed by Wang and Landau is used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of colloidal systems and to characterize the region of phase instability.",,,
1556,"Integration and Analysis of Seismic, Pore Pressure, and Strain Signals at the PBO Borehole Stations","The borehole stations of the Earthscope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) are providing unprecedented observations of co-located pore pressure and strain measurements over time scales of seconds to years, and over wide geographic and tectonic environments. Water level fluctuations in response to tides are well documented and understood, however the response to earthquakes, especially at the dynamic co-seismic, and short-term post-seismic time scales is less well understood. Observations of strain and water level steps due to earthquakes are presented, and we hypothesize the mechanism responsible for these changes based on the co-located strain observations. For each earthquake, the water table change is consistent with the co-seismic areal strain change, suggesting at least in part the influence of a static strain mechanism in each event. Two methods, one using Fourier transforms and the other cross correlation, are developed for calculating phase and amplitude differences of tidal forces before and after the earthquakes. Temporary phase and amplitude differences in the tidal signal were observed for the gradual post-seismic pore pressure increase at PBO 84 Pinon Flats during the El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake, implying a change in hydrological parameters. A smaller amplitude difference is also detected for the gradual decrease observed at PBO 88 Sky Oaks during the 2010 M5.4 Collins Valley earthquake. Using information from geophysical logs, the fracture orientation in boreholes was correlated with the principal strain directions of the strain field. Of the three tested earthquakes, two had ideal configurations for the observed pore pressure change. Lastly, the developed methods were tested for a pore pressure record in which there was no co-located strain.",,,
1557,"Toxic ""Outliers"" and ""Mainstreamers"": A Facility-Based Analysis of the Predictors of Pollution-Related Health Risk Intensity","Several key studies have revealed the existence of a small number of heavily polluting facilities that are responsible for generating the majority of emissions-based relative human health risk. Early work has also suggested that such outlier facilities tend to be poor performers economically as well as environmentally, that they place disadvantaged communities at particular risk, and that regulatory responses are not aligned with levels of risk production. To date, little scholarly attention has been devoted to these extreme variations in facility-based risk and to their significance from environmental equity and policy points of view. This research undertakes a number of separate but interrelated studies that focus on the explication of the ""disproportionality perspective,"" or the idea that these heavy polluters produce the majority of environmental harm without compensating societal benefit. In the first study, I determine the generalizability of disproportionate patterns in industrial pollution risk. Second, I show how this analytic framework can be used by regulators to promote environmental justice. Finally, I move beyond the traditional community-based environmental justice frame to focus on industrial risk intensity and its relationship to community factors. I contrast the riskiest polluters (""toxic outliers"") to the lower risk polluters (""mainstreamers"") in regard to environmental justice performance. I find that nonwhite and low income populations bear the overwhelming majority of risk from outliers and that outliers have significantly worse environmental justice performance than mainstreamers. I also explore the extent to which such injustices could be relieved if environmental policy compelled outliers to reduce their toxic burdens to the average for their sector. In entirety, the findings from this work show that disproportionate patterns in pollution production are highly reproducible and influenced by power-based societal dynamics. Findings also suggest that more emphasis should be placed on studying the distribution of environmental privileges as well as environmental problems and on understanding the inherent interconnections between these two sides of environmental inequality.",,,
1559,Rupture characterizations of the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan Earthquake and the 2011 Mw 9.1 Tohoku-Oki earthquake,"This dissertation focuses on the slip history of two well-observed devastating earthquakes: the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan, China event and the 2011 Mw 9.1 Tohoku-Oki, Japan event. We adopt a non-linear finite inversion code, developed by Ji et al. [2003], to image the kinematic rupture processes of those two earthquakes by jointly modeling seismic waveforms and geodetic measurements. Our results indicate that the Wenchuan earthquake simultaneously ruptured two sub-parallel faults with about 100 km on the low-angle Pengguan Fault and about 270 km on the high-angle Beichuan Fault. The rupture initiated at the intersection between those two faults and propagated only on the lower potion of the Pengguan Fault in the first 16 s. It then triggered the rupture on the Beichuan Fault about 40 km northeast of the hypocenter, where the Xiaoyudong Fault intersects those two faults on the surface. Although the Xiaoyudong Fault did not experience significant slip during the Wenchuan earthquake, it might act as a local tectonic boundary as inferred from the aftershocks and their focal mechanisms. For the Tohoku-Oki earthquake, our preferred model suggests that it has broken a big near-trench asperity with a peak slip up to 60 m. It re-ruptured the slip region of its March 9th M7 foreshock with a much larger slip, rise time, and slip velocity. One possible scenario model for this kind of foreshock-mainshock sequence is that the foreshock had only ruptured a relatively weaker patch inside a strongly coupled asperity, and the giant Tohoku-Oki event broke the strong asperity and released the deficit slip in the foreshock slip region. In addition to resolving the slip distributions for realistic earthquakes, we used the earthquake source inversion validation BlindTest 1 to investigate uncertainties associated with earthquake inversions based on strong motion data. Our results suggest that the fault slip and rise time distributions of the BlindTest 1 can be well constrained, but inversions using the variance reduction function of velocity waveforms as the objective function have low sensitivity to the total seismic moment and peak slip. Therefore, it is crucial for source studies to develop new inversion schemes that can properly honor the frequency and time dependent energy distribution of seismic radiation.",,,
1560,The effects of dopamine and a uniform feedback signal in a multiple-systems model of human category learning,"COVIS is a neurobiologically motivated model of human category learning. It hypothesizes that two neurobiologically distinct systems mediate different kinds of category learning tasks. The explicit system is based on cortical areas (e.g., prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex) and their connections to subcortical areas and is thought to mediate learning in tasks requiring hypothesis testing, logical reasoning, and executive attention. The procedural system is based on a collection of subcortical areas (the basal ganglia) and is believed to mediate non-declarative, procedural learning. Both systems of COVIS posit a critical role of dopamine in learning. Further, in its current formulation, both systems of COVIS learn independently and receive independent feedback signals. In the present report, a computational implementation of COVIS was described and used to explore dopamine in learning and to test a new assumption that the systems do not learn independently by delivering a single source of feedback to both systems of COVIS. First, COVIS was used to simulate the results of nine datasets with human subjects who are either dopamine deprived (e.g., Parkinson's disease patients) or dopamine abundant (e.g., induced positive mood). Overall, COVIS was able to account for each data set through only dopamine-related parameter manipulation. Second, by exhaustively searching the model's parameter space, it was shown that the procedural system of COVIS could not learn with a single source of feedback unless it controlled the overall output of the model for most of the simulation. Further simulations indicate that assuming the explicit system trains up (i.e., bootstraps) the procedural system mitigates its failure to learn with one source of feedback. It is hypothesized that this bootstrapping is made possible through recurrent corticostriatal projections from motor areas.",,,
1561,Linear and nonlinear sensing techniques in a single input single output MEMS oscillator,"A single input single output MEMS parameter sensor is investigated as a candidate for a chemical nose application. MEMS are subject to and influenced by noise sources which are inherent as well as introduced by measurement electronics. A method for quantifying the precision of parameter estimation is applied for prediction of linear sensor resolution in the presence of noise. The dynamic range of linear sensors is bound by the noise floor and the onset of nonlinearity: as the noise increases the dynamic range is thus decreased. Nonlinear sensing techniques are embraced for large amplitude response. Focus is given to a parametric resonator, where the stiness of the structure is modulated near twice the resonant frequency. Statistical methods dene the probability for the parametric resonator to be in a large amplitude state, leading to its resolution. The results of these methods lead toward comparing the linear and nonlinear parameter sensing techniques.",,,
1562,An Instrument to Measure Polarized CMB Foregrounds at 10 and 15 GHz,"New CMB experiments are being proposed and built with the goal of eventually resolving the B-mode polarization pattern imprinted in the CMB from a stochastic background of gravitional waves left over from an inflationary epoch in the very early universe. It has been widely acknowledged that the ability to resolve the B-mode polarization pattern in the CMB will require a more sophisticated understanding of the obscuring galactic foreground emission than what currently exists. Of the various galactic foregrounds, synchrotron radiation is identified as both the most polarized, and the most complicated in terms of spectral and spatial variability. The COsmic Foreground Explorer (COFE), described in this dissertation, is a NASA funded balloon borne mission to map polarized galactic foreground emission in two frequency bands, one centered at 10 GHz and the other at 15 GHz. These frequency bands make COFE particularly sensitive to polarized synchrotron radiation, and the separation between these two frequency bands facilitates the discrimination of the synchrotron component from the CMB and other foreground sourced such as free-free emission and spinning dust. COFE was successfully launched in September of 2011, and acquired data during a 22 hour flight. COFE is currently being reconfigured to acquire additional data from a high altitude, ground based observatory.",,,
1563,"Persecution and Permanence: Re-Negotiating Brazil's Identity, Religious Intolerance, and Consuming Candomble","Over the last 10 years, religiously fueled conflicts have been on overdrive. The new wave of Pentecostalism in Bahia, Brazil is gaining strength. The Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus stands as a religious behemoth in the city center of Salvador. It is a golden palace displaying its clear economic might, political power and influence over public morale, surrounded by the mushrooming impoverished hillsides of the disempowered masses. In its effort to distinguish cosmologies in a world of religious syncretism and Catholic hegemony, the Evangelical Church depends on demonizing Candomble, an African-Diasporic religion. Candomble has had a long history of oppression and discrimination in Brazil and early scholarship surrounding Candomble has always linked it to represent a traditional Afro-Brazilian identity. However, Candomble no longer represents nostalgia to the colonial past but rather an alternative modernity. This paper explores the effects of demonization of Candomble in Salvador, Bahia Brazil by analyzing the current interactions between state/govt. agencies, the Evangelical movement, and the Candomble community as they penetrate public morale, the booming tourist industry, and ultimately negotiate Brazil's new identity. Furthermore, as a result of this conflict, rising new alliances show that Candomble is not a fragile religion in danger of extinction but has instead entered the playing field of global religions fighting for legitimacy, popularity and acceptance. Lastly, this research suggests that sustaining religiously fueled conflicts amongst the Afro-Brazilian community is ultimately a political tool that destabilizes progress towards a unified movement against similar structural social problems.",,,
1564,Growth and Physics of III-N Based Solar Cells by Ammonia Molecular Beam Epitaxy,"To move beyond 50% efficiency multijunction solar cells, additional higher energy junctions are needed, and none of the conventional semiconductors can fill this role. Because of a large absorption coefficient (alpha ~10 5 cm-1 for GaN) and a wide diode depletion (~300 nm), the potential for significant optical absorption in the depletion of a p-i-n diode is promising for a drift-based solar cell based on the III-nitride system. The work described in this thesis covers the development of InGaN material growth by ammonia molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and its incorporation into photovoltaic devices. A new regime of high V/III ratio and modulated growth was explored in ammonia MBE, leading to device quality material layers. It was observed that increasing ammonia overpressure during growth dramatically increased the indium incorporation efficiency for a given group-III flux and substrate growth temperature. Upon increasing the ammonia pressure, however, the growth rate was observed to decrease. The growth rate reduction was explained by a free-space particle scattering model wherein group-III source beams are attenuated through collisions with the high density of ammonia molecules above the surface of the substrate. By modulating the ammonia flow and substrate temperature during alternating growth of InGaN and GaN layers, the growth of high quality InGaN/GaN superlattice and multiquantum-well (MQW) structures was achieved. These observations and techniques allowed the extension of device quality layers to smaller bandgap quantum wells through the increased incorporation of indium. The InGaN layers grown by this method were then incorporated into photovoltaic (PV) device structures. The physics of quasi-bulk and MQW PV devices was explored through empirical and theoretical means. The short minority carrier diffusion length in highly n and especially p-type GaN was predicted to result in poor collection efficiency for photogenerated carriers. Experiments with varying the p-window layer thickness resulted in dramatically increased short-wavelength external quantum efficiency improvement. EQE simulations of these devices confirm these results and give estimates of minority carrier diffusion lengths in p-GaN. Very high internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was confirmed, however, for material within the depletion region of a p-i-n diode, as measured by comparing device EQE data to measured optical absorption. To extend the PV spectral response to longer wavelengths, a change to the MQW-based structures was found to prevent morphological breakdown and result in much higher open-circuit voltages. A significant barrier-thickness dependent behavior was observed in these devices, with increasing IQE for decreasing barrier thickness. Temperature-dependent L-I-V curves and temperature-dependent biased EQE curves were measured to probe this behavior. A reduction in carrier escape times was suggested to explain the increase in IQE for reduced barrier devices. For thin barriers, a temperature-independent mechanism was observed. Calculations of tunneling and thermionic emission carrier escape corroborated the measured results and suggested tunneling dominated for all devices at room temperature and lower, while thermionic emission dominated for thicker-barrier samples at elevated temperatures. The dramatically increased performance of the thinner barrier samples suggested a future direction for practical performance devices for multijunction integration.",,,
1565,"Advantage Through Crisis: Multiracial American Japanese in Post-World War II Japan, Okinawa and America 1945--1972","Advantage Through Crisis, is a comparative history of multiracial American-Japanese people who grew up in the U.S., Japan, and Okinawa during the post-World War II period through reversion in 1972. Immediately after the war, many children sired by members of the U.S. military were left behind in the care of their Japanese mothers and the Japanese government. Thousands of these multiracial Japanese-born Americans, neither received citizenship from the Japanese government nor were acknowledged by the U.S. government, and were legally stateless. Many were objects of intense discrimination and physical abuse because their visible American features made them politically marked bodies and a symbol of Japan's defeat. In short, they were Americans left overseas without U.S. governmental support, and often without the support of their biological parents. Many of these individuals lived in orphanages for mixed-race people until adopted by American, Japanese, or European families. At the same time they were left in the care of others, numerous American-Japanese grew up with their biological families in the U.S. and in Japan observing interracial marriages and their mixed families firsthand. Quite a few came to the U.S. on their own as teenagers and adults. I document the history of American-Japanese people through oral history, and construct my narrative by contextualizing their voices with archival research. This research is the first to look at life course histories of mixed-race American-Japanese, who are in their fifties and sixties, while examining their transnational experience. My approach of oral history in combination with archival research in English and in Japanese provides a complete historical framework of this population. My contribution to the scholarship connects the existing research on war brides, mixed-race families and Critical Mixed Race Studies and expands it to include the voices of multiracial people, including adoptees, from interracial unions. Upon interviewing multiracial people in the U.S. and Japan, I found that despite discrimination based on differences in race, often their multiracial consciousness served to provide them with options, not limitations. This study gives voice, presence, and historical recognition to American-Japanese whose stories, until now, were rarely told from their perspective.",,,
1566,"The homes we inhabit: Implicating socio-historical, cultural, political narratives in the negotiation of mathematics relationships","Narratives or Discourses influence how identity is read to such a degree that they serve to equate certain identities or groups of people -- African Americans, Latin s, American Indians, immigrants and women to name a few -- with intellectual and academic inferiority despite remarkable performances or significant accomplishments. This is especially true for mathematics since narratives also position math as the ultimate sign of intelligence and academic superiority. This narrative inquiry implicates such socio-historical, cultural, political narratives and their associated binaries in the (re)production of inequities in mathematics and with Walkerdine (1990) contends that ""the issue was never about `real' performances, but the stories we tell about them, the discourses in which they are inscribed and the positions these make available to the learner"" (p. 135). To this end, this project explored the stories 44 high school students told about mathematics, the narratives their stories were situated in and the positions these made available to the students as learners. Through competing & contradictory narratives, the homes students built were tied to complex multiple identities, including race, ethnicity, nation, gender, sexuality, class, athlete, and often included tensions, constraints & oppositions. Students negotiated their relationships to mathematics through two particular competing meta-narratives -- the Intellectual Development Discourse and the Schooling Discourse. Some students negotiated relationships with mathematics that were central (Central Street homes), some students negotiated relationships with mathematics via an Alpha phenomenon (Alpha Way homes) and some students negotiated relationships that were peripheral to mathematics (Peripheral Circle homes). Students whose identities were aligned with the higher status side of narrative binaries worked within the associated Discourses had the least tensions and were more likely to develop a relationship with mathematics where they could locate themselves as ""good at math."" This is because their experiences and lived realities worked to produce the pattern of binaries and their performance as ""natural."".",,,
1567,Oppositional Performance: A Social-Historical Analysis of the Avant-Garde Comedy Troupe Chicano Secret Service,"This dissertation documents, describes, and analyzes the emergence and elaboration of cultural expressions produced by the comedy troupe Chicano Secret Service (CSS) from 1988 to the present. As part of the Chicana/o Radical Performance Tradition, the performances of CSS imagined and created a culture of liberation and emancipation through Chicana/o political satire. The sketch comedy troupe's response to the neoliberal racial capitalist moment of the late 1980s to the present articulated what I describe as ""Oppositional Performance."" This dissertation argues that instances of opposition performance emanate from within the contested historical context between the dominant neoliberal bloc and the emergent Chicana/o art performance bloc. Utilizing the interdisciplinary research methods of Chicana/o Cultural Studies and incorporating performance studies, media studies, history, and sociology, this dissertation interrogates the socio-historical significance of Chicano Secret Service and Chicana/o cultural production. This dissertation also serves as a CSS archive. Interviews were conducted with all the members of CSS: Elias Serna, Susan Carrasco, Eduardo Lopez. As a scholar/activist/ and member of CSS I have utilized an observant participant method to conduct a critical oral history of CSS. I also conducted interviews with people that played a large role in assisting CSS to become an avant-garde comedy troupe, such as Luis Valdez, Rene Yanez, Tiffany Ann Lopez, Kinan Valdez, Laura Perez and Diane Gamboa. I also collected and analyzed CSS films and performance videos, along with a collection of newspaper articles, unpublished scripts, posters, performance programs and original story boards. My cultural-historical analysis links the practices of CSS to the Chicana/o power movement renaissance art movement and to the Chicana/o avant-garde. Grounded in this Chicana/o Radical Performance Tradition, CSS expresses the collective response of the Chicana/o working classes in Southern California in a neoliberal historical context. I analyze four landmark actos/sketches and three multimedia performances to demonstrate how Chicana/o expressive cultures can subvert hegemony in ephemeral yet unpredictably enduring terms. The oppositional performances produced by CSS resonate within the Chicana/o Radical Performance Tradition that simultaneously critiques cultural domination and turns hegemony on its head. Drawing on oppositional performances and the Chicana/o Radical Performance Tradition as a framework, I argue that Chicano Secret Service's work exhibits the tenets expressed within the Radical Chicana/o Tradition in a more general manner. Although such performances illuminate the life world of the individuals within CSS, the collaborative relations between different bodies, memories, and communities within enacted performance spaces intertwine to produce a collective Chicana/o performance and social power. This dissertation argues that such performances are mestizo rhetorics, new inventions of Western and indigenous cultures that create forms of Chicana/o knowledge.",,,
1568,"How leader behaviors influence task, procedural, and social goals in small group decision making: A mixed methods approach","The aim of this study was to better understand how leaders influence task, procedural, and social goals in small group decision making. These three goals support communications, which, in turn, leads to better decisions. Task goals include contributing and evaluating ideas. Procedural goals include agenda setting, establishing norms, and verbalizing agreement. Social goals include climate making, promoting cooperation, and investigating good (constructive) conflict. Leader behaviors influence small group communications positively and negatively. Small group communications present challenges for leaders due to diversity, conflict, cooperation, and interpersonal skills of the members themselves. Although much has been written about the epistemology of leadership, few empirical studies have described how leaders use communications to influence the members of small groups who are engaged in small group decision making. This study followed two groups of five ROTC cadets who were engaged in a military decision-making academic exercise. The design was primarily a descriptive qualitative study using interviews although data were collected through a questionnaire (DV = leadership and IV = task, procedural, and social goals). Data were scored using rubrics. The interviews were scored using rubrics and points were awarded when a cadet mentioned a key word or acceptable alternative. Both types of data were then statistically analyzed. In addition, the interview data were analyzed for themes regarding how leaders influenced members. Regarding the questionnaire, there were no differences between the mean scores for the task, procedural, and social goals. Regarding the interviews, task goals, members were thematically influenced by leader statements about time, task steps, and the making of quality decisions. Regarding procedural goals, members were thematically influenced by leader statements about re prioritizing time and creating updated time lines, both of which caused renegotiating of group norms, verbalizing agreement, and looking for gaps in shared understanding. Regarding social goals, members were thematically influenced by leader statements about resolving factual and procedural conflict and regulating participation. Lastly, both ROTC groups were thematically influenced by the professor of military science who provided commander's intent, feedback, and updated information during the Military Decision Making Process.",,,
1569,Keeping the Red Queen in Check: Dynamic Mutation-Selection Balance in Evolving Populations,"In this dissertation we describe the microscopic behavior and emergent phenomena of evolutionary dynamics. We introduce frameworks that explicitly incorporate the effects of beneficial and deleterious mutations, and distributions of mutations. We treat a full distribution of mutations in adapting populations, providing a unified description of interference between established mutations. We compute experimentally observable parameters, including the speed of adaptation and the distribution of fixed mutations, for a general underlying distribution of available beneficial mutations. We identify an equivalence between the adaptive dynamics using a distribution of mutations, and the well known dynamics of mutations with a single fitness effect. Treating beneficial and deleterious mutations simultaneously, a dynamic mutation-selection balance emerges, which we argue is an evolutionarily stable state. The dynamic balance state describes a population in which rare beneficial mutations are sufficient to halt the stochastically driven extinction of subclasses in the population. This introduces a stationary state which we argue lies in an attractive basin, such that any generic adaptive population or fitness degrading population will approach the same equilibrium. The existence of this evolutionary ""attractor"" and its stability introduce this description as a new null expectation for any evolving population. We suggest that more complicated biological effects, such as changes in mutation rate, may be viewed as effective perturbations away from this state.",,,
1570,Field-Induced Charge-Separation Lasers for Direct Gain Modulation,"Optical interconnects are of great interests as their electrical counterparts reach the physical limits. The two main research motivations are: (1) on-chip optical interconnects to sustain the growth of microprocessors and (2) the optical datalinks that bridge the communication between server racks within mega data centers and high-performance computers. As ultra-high speed photodetectors are readily available for commercial use, optical interconnects often see the performance bottleneck at the laser end. In terms of energy per bit, direct modulation is always the most efficient method to operate a laser. However, the interaction between carriers and photons inside the laser active region gives rise to the relaxation resonance, which sets the limit for modulation speed. Increasing the bias current is the easiest way to increase the relaxation resonance frequency, until damping effect takes over. Moreover, high current density unfortunately leads to material degradation and shortens the device lifetime. To achieve a better performance scaling, we investigated the concept of direct gain modulation, which from our study showed the addition of a zero frequency to the conventional two-pole transfer function of directly modulated lasers, and promised a higher modulation bandwidth. To realize direct gain modulation, we proposed a novel field-induced charge-separation laser (FICSL) structure in a three-terminal vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSELs) embodiment. In this presentation, the theory, device design, modeling, growth, fabrication, and experimental results of FICSLs will be discussed.",,,
1571,Nonlinear Exciton Dynamics in IndiumGalliumArsenic Quantum Wells,"Near infrared and optical light applied near the band edge of a semiconductor can lead to the formation of bound electron-hole pairs known as excitons. Using growth methods such as molecular beam epitaxy, semiconductor heterostructures can be engineered to have properties beneficial to particular experiments. The formation of thin layers of semiconductor can lead electrons and holes to be confined along a particular direction, and one structure that can be grown is called a quantum well. Confinement of charge in the quantum well increases the Coulomb interaction between the electron and hole, increasing exciton formation. When excitons are driven with an intense THz field, changes to the optical properties of the semiconductor are observed. These changes to the optical properties can not only provide interesting information about the exciton system, but also may provide insight on modulating optical beams at THz frequencies, information that may be necessary to further improve the speed of our cable and internet connections. By growing InGaAs quantum wells with AlGaAs barriers on a GaAs substrate, we have observed strong changes to the optical spectrum due to intense THz fields. We find that when the strong THz field is applied to an intersubband transition in the quantum well, the applied field can significantly shift the energy of that intersubband transition. This shift is unexpected within the approximations often used to describe this system, and we find that full numerical simulations of the system are necessary to interpret our results. When the strong THz field is polarized in the plane of the quantum well, we are able to observe optical light at up to 11 frequencies that were not present before application of the THz. The new frequencies are separated from the optical frequency by multiples of the THz frequency and are often referred to as sidebands. To understand the origin of the high-order sidebands observed, which are present up to 8 th order, a recollision model between electrons and holes is adopted. Strong agreement with theoretical predictions indicates that recollisions are responsible for high-order sideband generation providing an intriguing connection between atomic and condensed matter phenomena.",,,
1572,The Female Complaint and the Elizabethan Literary Profession,"My project examines the female complaint: the vogue in sixteenth-century England for male poets adopting female personae. In particular, I set out to explore the function of the complaint's feminine personae in the poets' representations of themselves as authors. The conventional critical reading suggests that the poets adopt female personae in order to master a female voice and thereby assert their own authorial presence. I contend, however, that this reading has a reductive effect on our understanding of both authorship and gender. By developing an alternate interpretation of this phenomenon that takes seriously these poets attempts to identify with their female subjects, I show how the female complaint is deployed to explore the boundaries between display and exposure these poets negotiated as their literary projects moved from the complex intimacies of manuscript exchange to the public realm of print. The female complaint, I argue, allowed authors to negotiate the changing relationship to their print readership, patrons, and stationers. On the one hand, as a state of abjection, femininity sets the poets and their subjects off from other texts, allowing them to distinguish themselves in a type of self-promotion. On the other hand, abjection contained this self-promotion within a framework of humility and dependence. Thus the poems allowed poets to promote themselves to broad, new reading publics while still decorously presenting themselves to their patrons. My project offers a prehistory of the modern author that challenges received wisdom about what it meant to be a literary artist in sixteenth-century England.",,,
1573,Embodying Loss: Bodily Perspectives and the Reclamation of Interdependence in African American and Chicana/o Literature,"Bodies in Western liberal, legalistic, and psychoanalytic discourse are often portrayed as autonomous subjects who interact with others and who make choices and claims based on assertions of individual agency. This dissertation explores how African American and Chicana/o writers respond to and refigure these assertions of bodily representations in their own writings. I argue that assertions of autonomy on the part of liberal subjects assume an understanding of the human body and subject that reinforces a dichotomous framework. This dichotomous framework only bolsters a cognitive formation that obfuscates the dependency implicit in relationships among individuals and of individuals to their environments. This practice has devastating effects for people of color for it ignores material, historical sources of contemporary race relations and the spatial fields on which they've been played out. The texts I examine, however, interrogate the dichotomies of self/other, white/black, male/female by developing an understanding of the body as interdependent in relation to both space and to others. Moreover these authors show through these interdependent relationships how material histories of racism and patriarchy continue to inform the very subjectivity of people of color and the ways they experience both space and others. I theorize the notion of interdependency specifically through the frames of embodiment and loss/trauma. The authors I examine all address loss/trauma through a bodily perspective, where trauma, whether it occurs through experiences of death, mental illness, or abuse, becomes an opening for representations of relationships of interdependency. In novels by Sandra Cisneros, Tomas Rivera, and Toni Morrison, I have found that each writer focuses on the bodily perspective that is engendered by loss. These bodily perspectives articulate an imaginary of trauma that show how the body itself embodies an experiential knowledge of past and contemporary moments of trauma while also producing ways of reading loss that pose as critical correctives to hegemonic interpretations that often pathologize or otherwise discredit those experiences.",,,
1574,Factors Affecting Student Success in Distance Learning Courses at a Local California Community College: Joint Governance Perspectives,"The purpose of this study was to explore the perspectives of staff and faculty regarding factors affecting student success in distance learning at a California community college (CCC). Participants were members of the leadership group known as the distance learning committee. Data were collected through in-depth interviews using open-ended questions. Eight of 10 committee members volunteered to be interviewed for this study. This study identified four categories of factors affecting student success consistent with the literature: Organizational factors (campus and administrator support, user friendly course management systems, infrastructure), student internal factors (student initiative, familiarity with technology, motivation and competence), student external factors (family and work responsibilities), and pedagogical factors (course design, and course delivery). The literature on distance education primarily focuses on pedagogical factors and student internal and external factors affecting student success. Furthermore, the literature primarily addresses distance education programs. The CCCs in this study does not offer a certificate or degree completely through distance education, but does offer distance learning courses. This is a critical distinction to consider when examining distance learning courses at the CCCs. The majority of the participants interviewed focused on organizational and student internal factors affecting student success in distance learning. The majority also suggested providing faculty with training on course design and delivery. However, there was a difference of opinion on the implementation of that training. Staff members suggested that the training be mandatory, while faculty members suggested it be offered as opposed to mandatory. Additionally, participants stated that students could benefit from participating in a distance learning orientation to better prepare them prior to enrolling in distance learning courses. Finally, another critical observation was that faculty did not tend to focus on pedagogical factors affecting student success. These factors were prominent in the literature but not in the faculty responses. When faculty addressed course design or delivery they addressed it as a need the campus (the organization; hence, organizational factor) should address by offering professional development for the faculty. That this leadership group focused on organizational and student internal factors may have affected how the campus addressed student success in distance learning. Possibly, some critical factors were not getting needed attention from campus administration because the committee did not find them as critical as the organizational and pedagogical factors.",,,

My analysis involves the close observation of oral and visual elements of this narrative. I employ and deploy this as a telling case to study the conduct and consequences of teaching and educational relations (i.e., relations involving teachers, students, and subject matter).

In this sense, my study becomes a study of educational and educative transformation.",,,
1576,"A History of Mexican and Mexican Americans in the Coal Mining Regions of the Rocky Mountain West, 1880-1928","The late nineteenth and early twentieth century Rocky Mountain West coal mining region was a hub of migration, relocation, new settlements, and sites for the construction of new social identities as waves of workers and their families arrived in search of work. Mexican and Mexican Americans constituted an integral segment of these mining communities. The unforgiving nature and seclusion of the mountainous environment forced miners and their families to draw on their resources and ingenuity to struggle for their daily needs. This is a study of the relationship between family, community, and worker militancy amongst Mexican and Mexican American men and women through the use of networking and reciprocity. I begin my study by examining the immigration and migration of Mexicans to the Rocky Mountain West in response to work opportunities in the bituminous mines. I argue that work, the collective culture of the mining communities, and class struggle in this geographic region produced a unique working class experience that shaped and reshaped the lives of Mexican and Mexican Americans. I will delineate the growth and consolidation of these early mining communities that in essence were industrial colonies and then examine Mexican and Mexican American's participation in and shaping of the culture, values, institutions, and shared experiences of the mining camps. This is followed by a discussion of the lives of Mexicans in relation to other ethnic mine camp dwellers, all of whom lived in the ""foreign"" section of the camps. The welfare of mine camp households was contingent upon miner's wages. The shared experiences of day-to-day survival drew mine camp residents together into tight community networks. Mine companies dominated politics and society; however, trade unionism and radical politics likewise distinguished the mining camps and enriched community life. Socialists frequently visited the camps, and the Industrial Workers of the World were leading activists who inspired the miner and their families to militancy and added to outbursts of radical activism. I draw on strike actions in southern and northern Colorado from the 1880s to the 1920s to illustrate my argument, particularly the 1914 Ludlow Massacre and the 1927 Columbine Coal Strike.",,,
1577,Scalar Top Quark Search with Jets and Missing Momentum in pp Collisions at 7 TeV,"The results of CMS searches for Supersymmetry are interpreted in the context of Simplified Models. A limited set of hypothetical particles and decay chains are introduced to produce a given topological signature. The amplitudes describing the production and decays of these particles are parametrized in terms of the particle masses and their branching ratios to daughter particles. Among the new possible particles, the Higgs mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking gives a special role to the partner of the third generation SM particles. In this thesis, I will describe how the comparison of different search strategies on multiple simplified models helps to quantify that the LHC has not put any stringent bounds on them yet. The 4.98 fb-1 of data collected by CMS, was analyzed to search for the scalar stop in the jets plus met final state. In particular, I will focus on the ttbar background; I will describe in detail the handles used to reduce it and the technique adopted to predict this contribution from data. The data is found to be in agreement with the predicted backgrounds. An upper limit on the cross section times branching ratio is set for the decays stop to LSP plus top and stop to LSP plus b W through a chargino final state.",,,
1578,Jewish Women and their Community in late Medieval and Renaissance Perugia,"Throughout most of the twentieth century, historians of Medieval European Jewish communities overlooked the contributions of Jewish women to their families and to their communities. Recently, historians of northern European and Spanish Jews have begun to utilize notarial records to describe the financial activities of Jewish women in the Middle Ages. Yet few historians have utilized documents of practice to examine the activities of Jews in medieval or Renaissance Italy. Those few who have focus almost exclusively on the larger centers of Rome and Venice, which while important, do not represent the more typical and much smaller Jewish communities scattered throughout northern and central Italy in this period. This dissertation aims to address this oversight, and thus examines the economic roles played by Jewish women in the central Italian town of Perugia in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance. Notarial evidence reveals that by the fifteenth century, Jewish women not only possessed their own property, they managed it, alienated it, and gave it away as personal bequests in their wills. They also acted as heads-of-households in the absence of their husbands, and participated in decisions concerning family property, engaged publically in banking, and interacted with non-Jewish men in regards to business affairs. In Perugia, this was a new development. Why did it develop when it did? And what did this mean for women's position within their families and their community? By placing my analysis of these notarial records against the political backdrop of late medieval and Renaissance Perugia and within a discussion of normative rabbinic literature, I explore how this practice---female financial autonomy within the family---can be understood as a tool that aided the family's and community's struggle, and developed in response to a increasingly unstable political and social environment in Renaissance Perugia. Thus this study contributes not only to historians' understandings of this small yet important Jewish community, but also to our knowledge of the contributions Jewish women made to these communities, contributions that often far exceeded the expectations---or desires---of late antique and medieval rabbis.",,,
1579,Confronting Capitalist Globalization and Polyarchy in Oaxaca: An Assessment of the APPO Movement and the Prospects for Social Movements in Mexico,"In 2006, the social insurrection in Oaxaca and its impact revealed a polyarchic system in Mexico that maintains hegemony over meanings of democracy. This legitimizes both further incorporation into an asymmetrical global capitalist system, and sanctions draconian policies against social movements dissenting against growing marginalization. Moreover, although the central demand of the APPO movement was to oust then-governor of Oaxaca, Ulises Ruiz, their call for a radical transformation of Oaxaca's sociopolitical institutions proposed alternative concepts of democracy espoused by prominent subaltern social movements in Mexico. The APPO's takeover of the capital city of Oaxaca de Juarez presented a crisis of social stability and political legitimacy. Therefore, this project utilizes Robinson's theories of polyarchy and capitalist globalization a theoretical framework to piece together the conjunctures of crises in Oaxaca during and after 2006. Utilizing newspaper articles, primary sources of witnesses during this period, and on-field research conducted in Oaxaca I offer an ethnographic, sociological analysis of the APPO movement and its sociopolitical impact. Finally, this project suggests theoretical perspectives for understanding the possibilities for social movements to create radical social change.",,,
1580,Racial Socialization and Identity Development of Middle Class African American and Biracial Adolescent Girls Attending an Independent School: A Case Study,"This case study was conducted to: (1) compare and contrast the experience of middle class, African American and Biracial adolescent female students attending an independent school, (2) examine the racial socialization the participants receive from their mothers and school personnel as high school students, and (3) examine the impact of the racial socialization at home and school on the identity formation of the student participants. Findings indicated the participants received messages in two dimensions of racial socialization, cultural socialization and egalitarianism. The study revealed Biracial students took on more leadership roles than Black students. Findings also revealed a stark contrast between the Black and White parental experiences as school community members. Finally, school personnel explained their contribution and dedication to creating racial and cultural diversity on campus. The analyses are based on qualitative data collected in 2009 and 2012 from semi-structured interviews with African American female students from ninth grade and twelfth grade, Biracial female students from ninth and twelfth grade, an African American mother, a White mother, and two senior administrative personnel.",,,
1581,"Latino Listening Cultures: Identity, Affect, and Resilient Music Practices","This dissertation is a qualitative analysis of Chicano/Latino music listeners in Southern California. The purpose of this study is to investigate how listening to music, through its affective (both specific sentiments and a general sense of what a space or time feels like) and sonic energies, generates modes of thinking and feeling that shape identity, community and resilience. While Latino music cultures have long been celebrated listening and listening practices as a form of knowing, being and surviving is understudied. I focus on three groups of listeners that, I argue, represent Latino listening cultures--- a culturally specific set of shared attitudes, values and practices around listening to particular music. The listening cultures analyzed included Mexican custodians who listen to the radio at work, Chicana/o Morrissey fans, and undergraduate Latina/o iPod users. Methodologically, my research is grounded in ethnographic methods of participant-observation, interviews, surveys, and material collection. A total of 40 semi-structured interviews were carried out with Chicano/Latino music lovers and 275 students responded to a web survey. A grounded theory approach was used to code all data. Additionally, I recorded field observations at concerts, work spaces, and campus common areas. Findings suggest that practices, associations and feelings generated through listening to music are a significant site for critical awareness of ethnic and gender identity, racialization, and community. Ultimately, I argue listening may generate resilient forms of listening and living. One major finding from the Chicana/o listening culture built around Morrissey was that at an individual level, Morrissey provides a venue for fans to explore emotional losses and vulnerabilities, as well as, nontraditional gender roles and identities. At the collective level, listeners discussed finding solace over feeling excluded from the wider society because of racial and cultural differences. The Mexican custodians found, in Spanish-language radio, a late-night companion for their solitary job, an affirming connection to Mexico and a way to literally claim space through music. A survey of 275 undergraduate Latinos revealed that listening to music on digital music players functioned as a sonic refuge for coping with stress, a minoritized status on campus, as well as a portable sonic archive of ethnic identity.",,,
1582,Membrane Deformations: Quantitative Investigations with Lipid Worms and Supported Bilayers,"Biological membranes spatially deform in response to environmental stresses. It is not understood how adhesion to a support, such as a solid surface or a cytoskeletal network, influences this remodeling. Supported lipid bilayer (SLB) is a model membrane system consisting of a bilayer adsorbed to a solid surface. Using SLB, we quantitatively investigate membrane transformations from planar to tubular to spherical morphologies. Spherical shells (vesicles) exposed to a solid surface adsorb and rupture to form planar bilayer. We investigated this process using fluorescence microscopy. Low lipid concentrations made it possible to resolve previously inaccessible features of vesicle adsorption and bilayer formation. In particular, these experiments revealed that, after a period of constant accumulation, vesicle adsorption accelerates as bilayer patches appear. As the patches spread and coalesce into a continuous SLB, unruptured vesicles desorb. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the increased rate of adsorption and subsequent loss of vesicles can be attributed to the emergence and disappearance of bilayer edges. These results pertain to zwitterionic lipids and glass surfaces in particular, but we also demonstrate SLB formation using charged lipids and sapphire surfaces. We tested this hypothesis using an SLB with excess bilayer edge. Such an SLB can be made based on the large mismatch in thermal expansivity between bilayer and glass, which causes the SLB to form holes upon cooling. Vesicles adsorb to the glass surface exposed by the holes at a faster rate and a higher density than on bare glass. We further explore the transformation from planar to tubular morphologies. Small increases in temperature (_1C) expand the SLB more than its support, but the difference is small enough to relax via bilayer creep. Larger increases (_5C) result in an irreversible transformation in which semi-flexible filaments (worms) emerge from the SLB. Individual worms are tubules of <1 microm diameter, but often reach hundreds of microns in length before spontaneously retracting into discs. At high ionic strength, the sub-resolution worms adhere to the SLB, enabling measurement of their radius to within +/-5 nm using fluorescence microscopy. Finally, we measure the retraction rate and comment on retraction disk morphology.",,,
1583,"The Birth of Her Causa: The Construction, Development, and Ideology of Comision Femenil Mexicana Nacional, Inc., 1973--1993","This dissertation examines the history of Comision Femenil Mexicana Nacional (CFMN). Focusing on a class, race, and gender analysis, CFMN emerged in the 1970s as the prominent Chicana feminist organization. Though often categorized as a middle-class Chicana organization because of its members' socioeconomic standing, CFMN's origins come from the communist class, race, and gender analysis of founder Francisca Flores to address Chicana poverty. Central to this study is the development of Chicana feminist thought through personal engagement with the Chicano Movement. Questioning the role of women, particularly their second-class status within the Chicano organizations of the 1960s, young Chicanas gravitated to CFMN because of the organization's philosophy of helping Chicana and Latina women. As CFMN established chapters throughout the Southwest, it tackled multiple issues that impacted Chicanas' economic upward mobility. By addressing the triple oppression of class, race, and gender that Chicanas faced, CFMN developed programs that challenged the stereotypes of Chicanas in the workforce. Utilizing both governmental and private resources, CFMN established self-help organizations that targeted Chicana poverty through improvement of skills and the development of leaders within the organization itself.",,,
1584,In search of exceptional collections,"The following thesis deals mainly with two different problems, both of which are related to the study of exceptional collections of sheaves. The first problem was motivated after a result in the study of D3-branes in String Theory established a connection between a Del Pezzo surface of degree 1 and the finite trihedral group Delta27 through a three block exceptional collection. We prove after understanding these collections in depth that this connection can only be extrapolated to two other cases: P2 is connected to Z3 and the smooth cubic surfaces in P3 are connected to Z3_ Z3 . The second problem was motivated as well by String Theory, and it consists of finding and describing the exceptional sheaves and collections on the singular reducible variety S=P2H 3 where P2H3 =P1 . The surface S became an object of study when a crepant resolution of the singularity of type &frac15;(1, 1, 3) was found. More specifically, S is formed by the exceptional compact surfaces of the resolution. We provide insight in the study of the exceptionality of sheaves on S, finally showing that complete exceptional collections of invertible sheaves on S don't exist. We also show how to use mutations of exceptional pairs on S using the bounded derived category of sheaves Db(S).",,,
1585,Event-Based Optimal Control of Neurons,"Motivated by issues related to treating certain neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease by a method called electrical deep brain stimulation, we consider applying different control methods to both mathematical models of neurons and in vitro neurons. Patients suffering from Parkinson's disease experience involuntary tremors that typically affect the distal portion of their upper limbs. It has been hypothesized that these tremors are associated with simultaneous spiking of a cluster of neurons in the thalamus and basal ganglia regions of the brain. In a healthy situation, the periodic ring of neurons is not synchronized, but they can engage in a pathological synchrony and all re at the same time which results in release of strong action potentials that trigger the downstream muscles with periodic shocks, manifested as tremors. This dissertation investigates the control of different neuronal systems using methods of optimal control. The neuronal systems considered range from simple one-dimensional phase models to multi-dimensional conductance-based models, both on a single neuron level and on a population level. The optimal control methods considered produce event-based, continuous-time, typically bounded input stimuli that can optimally achieve the desired control objective. The optimality criteria considered are minimum energy and minimum time. The control objectives of interest are the interspike interval for single neurons and desynchrony for populations of neurons. There are three parts to this dissertation. In the first part, (Chapters 2 and 3), event-based time optimal and energy optimal control is presented to achieve desired interspike intervals for phase models of single neurons. In the second part, (Chapters 4 and 5), the problem of desynchronizing a network of pathologically synchronized coupled neurons is considered. In the third part, (Chapter 6), the theoretical method of Chapter 3 is adopted and the applicability of this method is shown in practice by testing the controller on in vitro pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of rat hippocampus.",,,
1586,Exploring Group Perception: The Relationship Between the Perception of Entitativity and Assessments of Cohesion,"Three studies explored the relationship between entitativity and cohesion and tested three predictions: (1) entitativity and cohesion are related but distinct concepts; (2) entitativity and cohesion are differentially driven by the same underlying cue properties; and (3) entitativity and cohesion are differentially related to performance behaviors, with cohesion serving as a better predictor of performance. In Study 1, participants sorted a list of 40 groups based on one of three guiding principles: (1) the definition of entitativity, (2) the definition of cohesion, (3) their intuitive concept of cohesion. Results indicated that participants sorted the groups into more similar patterns when guided by the definition of entitativity and their intuitive concept of cohesion. These sorting patterns differed from the pattern they used when sorting the groups based on the definition of cohesion. These results support the hypothesis that entitativity and cohesion are distinct concepts, but they suggest that participants intuitively consider cohesion to be similar to entitativity. In Study 2, intramural basketball teams were observed twice during a season. These observations were used to develop behavioral categories of team member interactions. Team members also provided self-report data on team entitativity, cohesion, and the presence of cue properties. In support of Prediction 1, entitativity was moderately correlated to cohesion, which was divided into social and task cohesion subtypes. In support of Prediction 2, entitativity and two cohesions were found to share different underlying cue properties. These relationships changed across time. Disconfirming Prediction 3, entitativity, cohesion, and the cue properties all predicted team performance, while seven of the eight behavioral categories failed to predict performance. Social cohesion was only marginally more related to the behavioral categories than entitativity. In Study 3, the cue properties were manipulated via vignettes about basketball teams. Participants read the vignettes and then rated the teams' entitativity and cohesion. In support of Predictions 1 and 2, manipulating the cue properties produced a greater response in team entitativity ratings than it did in team cohesion ratings, although the ratings did move in concert.",,,
1588,Impact Performance of Ceramics and Cermets,"Despite decades of research, no consensus exists on exactly how material properties affect ballistic performance. This dissertation seeks to advance the understanding of the impact process through a series of impact experiments, microstructural investigations, and analytical and numerical analyses on simple, idealized geometries of an armor alumina and two TiC/Ni cermets. The work begins with an assessment of the predictive capabilities of the recently-developed, mechanism-based Deshpande-Evans constitutive law, through comparisons to impact experiments on a confined, supported armor-grade alumina. Once calibrated, the model accurately predicts the size of the comminuted zone beneath the impact, and provides new insights into the spatial and temporal evolution of subsurface damage and deformation processes during impact. These experiments and finite element (FE) simulations motivate the development of an analytical framework within which the critical impact velocities required to initiate specific failure mechanisms can be predicted, as a function of material properties and geometry. This is accomplished through a series of FE simulations, coupled with analytical models for the maximum impact pressures and forces, and established initiation criteria for each mechanism. From these analyses failure mechanism maps are generated that provide insight into the sequence and hierarchy of deformation mechanisms during impact as well as the effects of property tradeoffs. The impact resistance and multi-hit potential of TiC/Ni cermets are evaluated and compared to alumina, tested in the form of plates backed by thin steel sheets. The cermets exhibit ballistic performance comparable to that of the alumina, but suffer significantly less extended cracking and fragmentation, indicating potential for superior multi-hit performance. For both cermets and the alumina, failure is shown to transition from cone cracking at low velocities, to shear plugging at the highest velocities. This transition is accompanied by a decrease in the efficacy of the tiles in spreading the load to the backing sheets, which results in sharper residual deflection profiles of the sheets. FE simulations and in situ observation of impacts on monolithic plates indicate that the shape of the deflection profile provides a useful measure of the effectiveness of the material in spreading the impact load.",,,
1589,Compact Low-Power Low-Noise Neural Recording Wireless Channel for High Density Neural Implants (HDNIs),"Biomedical implants hold the promise to restore functionality for patients who have been afflicted by debilitating diseases. The most successful of these technologies has been the cochlear implant that has restored hearing to thousands of patients around the world. However, progress in the field of neural recording devices has been slower, largely due to the vast differences in scale when it comes to recording. Recording from hundreds or even thousands of electrodes in the motion cortex is necessary for precise movement control in 3-dimension. The design of compact low-power circuits that allow for high-density neural recording is thus very crucial. This thesis work presents the design, simulation and measurement results of various compact low-power circuit blocks necessary for high-density neural recording. These include a compact, low-power, low-noise frontend neural amplifier that utilizes current-feedback miller-compensation technique and occupies _0.0075 mm2 of silicon area while consuming < 1.35 muW of power from a 1.2V supply. The amplified analog signal is then digitized by a 2nd-order DeltaSigma analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that is based on a compact fully-differential self-biased amplifier. The core of the ADC consumes only 2.5muW from a 1.2V supply, when sampled at 1.6 MHz, thus achieving a 60.5fJ/conversion-step FOM and occupies 0.012mm2 of chip area. This work also presents the design, simulation, and measurement results of an impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) transmitter with measured datarates up to 135Mbps with average power consumption &ap; 1.4 mW, and thus achieving a FOM &ap; 10pJ/bit. The transmitter's effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) must fit within the mask defined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), the pulse width, and the pulse amplitude are adjustable to ensure the transmitted pulse's power spectral density (PSD) fits within the FCC mask. The VCO's oscillation frequency is tuned through using an on-chip low-dropout (LDO) regulator that controls the VCO's supply voltage. Pulse-position modulation (PPM) was used as it is more noise immune compared to pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and on-off keying (OOK). PPM also breaks the periodicity in the transmitted pulses, thereby reducing the discrete tones that can otherwise show up in the PSD and potentially violate the FCC mask. Locking the oscillation frequency to the desired value is ensured through the use of a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) with Embedded Digital Tracking. The PLL's reference frequency can be the frequency used for wireless power harvesting. The PLL acquires lock within &ap; 1mus, and afterward the VCO starts operating in pulsed PPM mode. Once the PLL locks, most of its blocks are disabled to save power. The PLL occupies an area &ap; 0.2mm2 including the IR-UWB transmitter and the LDO regulator. Chip fabrication was in 0.13mum CMOS technology.",,,
1590,Enhancing LGBTQ emotional health: The role of LGBT community centers in addressing access to mental health and social support services,"Addressing disparities in healthcare has been a growing concern of service providers, administrators, policy makers, and researchers for over 50 years. This dissertation is the first academic inquiry into what a particular type of organization, the LGBT community center, is doing to meet the mental health and social support needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning/queer (LGBTQ) people. The minority stress model was used to explain why higher levels of distress and mental health consumer usage are found when comparing LGBTQ populations to the general population (Meyer, 2003). Goddard and Smith's (2001) framework of equity in access to healthcare, with components of availability, cost, quality, and information was used as a central framework in design, results, and discussion. In collaboration with CenterLink, Inc. (the national association for LGBT community centers), and LGBT Movement Advancement Project, the primary investigator and his research team analyzed archival data of 69 centers from the 2010 LGBT Community Center Survey and conducted a follow-up survey with a sub-set of 37 centers. Statistical analysis was used to test hypotheses and answer exploratory questions related to mental health and social service provision. There were four main findings. First, LGBT community centers contribute to the emotional health of LGBT people in multiple ways, both direct (provision of mental health and social support services) and indirect (referral to affirmative providers, training service providers and providing supervised clinical experience with LGBT populations to graduate students). Second, the mental health and social support services at LGBT community centers are not equally available to all LGBTQ individuals in the United States. LGBT community centers that provide in-depth and specialized services tend to be clustered within major metropolitan areas. Third, when LGBT community centers have more financial resources, they tend to provide a wider variety of services (therapy, psychiatry, support groups, hotlines, etc.) and more services designed for specific sub-populations (youth, transgender, people of color, etc.). Finally, LGBT community centers seem to be practicing within their scope of competence by utilizing providers with the appropriate level of schooling, supervision, and training to provide mental health and/or social support services.",,,
1591,Investigating the Structure-Property Relationships of Aqueous Self-Assembled Materials,"The components of all living organisms are formed through aqueous self-assembly of organic and inorganic materials through physical interactions including hydrophobic, electrostatic, and hydrogen bonding. In this dissertation, these physical interactions were exploited to develop nanostructured materials for a range of applications. Peptide amphiphiles (PAs) self-assemble into varying structures depending on the physical interactions of the peptides and tails. PA aggregation was investigated by cryo-TEM to provide insight on the effects of varying parameters, including the number and length of the lipid tails as well as the number, length, charge, hydrophobicity, and the hydrogen bonding ability of the peptides. It was determined that cylindrical micelles are most commonly formed, and that specific criteria must be met in order to form spherical micelles, nanoribbons, vesicles or less ordered aggregates. Controlling the aggregated structure is necessary for many applications---particularly in therapeutics. Additionally, two-headed PAs were designed to act as a catalyst and template for biomimetic mineralization to control the formation of inorganic nanomaterials. Finally, injectable hydrogels made from ABA triblock copolymers were synthesized with the A blocks being functionalized with either guanidinium or sulfonate groups. These oppositely charged polyelectrolyte endblocks formed complex coacervate domains, which served as physical crosslinks in the hydrogel network. The mechanical properties, the network structure, the nature of the coacervate domain and the kinetics of hydrogel formation were investigated as a function of polymer concentration, salt concentration, pH and stoichiometry with rheometry, SAXS and SANS. It was shown that the mechanical properties of the hydrogels was highly dependent on the structural organization of the coacervate domains and that the properties could be tuned with polymer and salt concentration. Polymer and salt concentration were also shown to play roles in determining the size and density of the coacervate domains. Additionally, 20 wt% hydrogels were shown to form through a nucleation and growth pathway, in which the coacervate domains formed within minutes, the BCC structure was predominant within 100 minutes, but the equilibrium structure was not achieved for months. Ultimately, the work presented in this dissertation has resulted in an improved understanding of the physical interactions that are needed for self-assembly and may eventually lead to smarter design of nanomaterials for therapeutic, electronic and mechanical applications.",,,
1593,An Analysis-Synthesis Approach to the Creative Processing of Video Signals,"Analysis and synthesis (A/S) approaches are common in multimedia signal processing. Reducing a signal to its constituent parts is relevant because once the signal is analyzed, the set of extracted parameters can be more convenient for storage, finite length representation, transmission or manipulation than the signal in its original form. The community of audio artists have adopted A/S techniques as an important part of their arsenal of technological tools for the creative manipulation of sounds. Parameters can be altered before the synthesis, generating sophisticated sound effects while maintaining the identity of the original signal. Tools such as the tracking phase vocoder allow musicians to manipulate pitch and duration independently or to combine two signals in exotic ways (cross-synthesis). However, a similar emphasis has yet to be pursued for the creative manipulation of video signals. This dissertation describes how A/S approaches can be used to obtain non-photorealistic representations from live video. In this research, new algorithms have been designed to overcome problems like temporal coherence and to extend concepts like the cross-synthesis of two video signals. The creative and narrative possibilities of the developed techniques are used to compose complete pieces divided between short animations and real time installations. Details on the design and implementation of those pieces are included in this document. The pieces, together with the different examples used throughout the dissertation illustrate the versatility and control that can be obtained with A/S approaches and confirm that these sets of techniques can be considered for the creative manipulation of video data.",,,
1594,The Effect of Chemical Functionality on Interfacial Dielectric Breakdown in Filled Silicone Elastomer Composites,"Dielectric elastomer actuators and sensors form a unique class of conformal and high strain devices whose performance is fundamentally limited by the elastomer's ability to withstand dielectric breakdown. In order to design new materials for dielectric elastomers, it is desirable to understand how breakdown occurs in these systems; a specific goal of this work is to clarify the role of chemistry in determining breakdown. For filled elastomer composites, commonly used as dielectric elastomers, the interface between matrix and filler particle is thought to be the primary region for electrical conduction. However, macroscopic investigations of such interfaces are prohibitively difficult in light of the complex and manifold factors which affect dielectric breakdown, such as material flaws and filler particle dispersion. Electrically characterizing chemically distinct but morphologically similar nanoscale interfaces allows the removal of particle-particle and other convoluting effects to isolate dielectric breakdown as a function of chemical modification. A method is described which permits the fabrication of idealized nanoscale interfaces through vapor depositing silane coupling agents as self assembled monolayers on silicon dioxide incorporating a diffusion barrier layer. With particular emphasis on filled silicone elastomers, these idealized interfaces are probed electrically at high fields in order to gain insight into how silane coupling agent functionality affects dielectric breakdown. Through Weibull and I-V analysis, conductive atomic force microscope breakdown experiments in 'strike' through the thickness of the organic monolayer on silicon native oxide reveal that fluorinated moieties suppress tunneling and improve breakdown resistance relative to their hydrocarbon analogues, attributable to the electron attaching ability of the highly electronegative fluorine atom. Additionally, a nanoscale test structure is fabricated to investigate surface breakdown in 'creep' at the interface between a silicone elastomer encapsulant and a chemically functionalized silicon dioxide substrate. Breakdown is found to occur primarily within two siloxane bond lengths outward from the oxide surface, and is heavily influenced by the presence of strongly bound 'ice like' water acting as a deep electron trap. Hydrogen bonding between different surface species is found to dictate the breakdown characteristics rather than silane coupling agent R group chemistry. Numerical simulations approximating creep breakdown reproduce qualitatively the Weibull characteristics observed in the experimental data.",,,
1596,Modeling the Change in PSAT Scores: A Growth Modeling Approach,"The Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT) is a test jointly administrated by the College Board and National Merit Scholarship Corporation, which is used to prepare high school students for the SAT, and as initial screening for numerous scholarships (Marini, Mattern, & Shaw, 2011). Previous research has acknowledged that the PSAT/NMSQT measures student's critical reading skills, quantitative reasoning, and writing skills related to academic success in college (Camara, 1998). Therefore, there is a substantial number of students who choose to retake the test in the subsequent year. The purpose of this study was to provide information about how test scores change in each component of the test (i.e. the PSAT-CR the PSAT-M, and the PSAT-W) when students retake the PSAT as well as to explore what factor influence the change in the test scores. Two cohorts of data were provided by the College Board--- students who graduated from high school in 2008, and in 2009. For these students, up to four testing occasions were available in the data along with numerous demographic and educational variables. Latent growth modeling (LGM) was employed to examine the trends in the individual trajectories of the PSAT-CR, the PSAT-M, and the PSAT-W. A series of unconditional models, models conditional on policy covariates, and models conditional on policy and educational covariates were fit to the data. Models assuming linear growth fit well in the PSAT-CR and the PSAT-M components of the test. The fit was less adequate for the PSAT-W. Gender and ethnicity emerged as significant predictors of the score obtained in the freshman year as well as the rate of change. The strongest educational predictor was writing ability. Results obtained from this longitudinal research are theoretically and practically informative for understanding the magnitudes of score change in the PSAT and the processes that are behind this change. Information on score change when the test is taken repeatedly may help students, teachers, test developers and test administrators to make better-informed decisions about testing students. Moreover, this information may also help parents and counselors who advise students on how to prepare for the test and whether to retake it.",,,
1597,Adhesive Interactions of Mussel Foot Proteins,"Improving our understanding of wet adhesion is crucial for developing next generation wet adhesives. Despite decades of efforts on developing better wet adhesives, water and moisture are still enemies of strong adhesion to polar surface; however, nature may have pointed the right direction to human beings: marine mussels achieve durable underwater adhesion using a suite of proteins that are peculiar in having high levels of 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa). The object of this research was to investigate the basic surface interactions employed by the mussels and roles of Dopa in the mussel adhesion. I used the surface forces apparatus (SFA) technique to measure the interactions between mussel foot protein-3 fast (Mfp-3 fast) and the model substrate, mica, as well as the interactions between various Mfps. The adhesion of Mfp-3 fast to mica is closely coupled with Dopa redox and pH. Raising the pH from 3 to 7.5 diminishes the adhesion energy of Mfp-3 on mica and appears to be driven by the pH-dependent oxidation of Dopa. Once Dopaquinone forms, it quickly undergoes tautomerization to alpha,beta--dehydrodopa, which abolishes side-chain rotation and optical activity in the alpha carbon, and imposes severe local configurational constraints, leading to an increase of the hydrodynamic radius of a single protein chain. Addition of thiol-rich mussel foot protein-6 (Mfp-6) restores mfp-3 adhesion by coupling the oxidation of thiols to the reduction of Dopaquinones. The strong cohesive interaction (Ead = -3 mJ/m2) between two Mfp-3 slow protein films over a wide range of pH (from 3 to 7.5) suggests that the hydrophobic Mfp-3 slow plays important roles in incorporating hydrophobic interactions and inter residue H-bonding to strengthen adhesives. The SFA tests on the adhesive properties of synthetic Mfp-5 derived short peptides with different overall charge and charge densities at different pH suggests that the electrostatic interactions also contribute to the adhesion of Mfp-5 to charged surfaces such as mica.",,,
1598,Stochastic Search and Surveillance Strategies for Mixed Human-Robot Teams,"Mixed human-robot teams are becoming increasingly important in complex and information rich systems. The purpose of the mixed teams is to exploit the human cognitive abilities in complex missions. It has been evident that the information overload in these complex missions has a detrimental effect on the human performance. The focus of this dissertation is the design of efficient human-robot teams. It is imperative for an efficient human-robot team to handle information overload and to this end, we propose a two-pronged strategy: (i) for the robots, we propose strategies for efficient information aggregation; and (ii) for the operator, we propose strategies for efficient information processing. The proposed strategies rely on team objective as well as cognitive performance of the human operator. In the context of information aggregation, we consider two particular missions. First, we consider information aggregation for a multiple alternative decision making task and pose it as a sensor selection problem in sequential multiple hypothesis testing. We design efficient information aggregation policies that enable the human operator to decide in minimum time. Second, we consider a surveillance problem and design efficient information aggregation policies that enable the human operator detect a change in the environment in minimum time. We study the surveillance problem in a decision-theoretic framework and rely on statistical quickest change detection algorithms to achieve a guaranteed surveillance performance. In the context of information processing, we consider two particular scenarios. First, we consider the time-constrained human operator and study optimal resource allocation problems for the operator. We pose these resource allocation problems as knapsack problems with sigmoid utility and develop constant factor algorithms for them. Second, we consider the human operator serving a queue of decision making tasks and determine optimal information processing policies. We pose this problem in a Markov decision process framework and determine approximate solution using certainty-equivalent receding horizon framework.",,,
1599,"Reproducing Regional Styles: Irish Traditional Music in Milwaukee, Wisconsin","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, boasts a vibrant Irish traditional music and dance community. Spurred on by a strong dance scene, numerous pub sessions, the cultural and educational influence of Milwaukee Irish Fest and its Summer School, and the transnational circulation of performers and audio recordings, local traditional musicians have developed considerable skills, as well as strong personal and collective styles. In a number of cases, musicians associate themselves, through the style and repertoire of their playing, with specific regional styles of traditional music in Ireland, such as those of County Donegal or Sliabh Luachra (Counties Cork and Kerry). It is remarkable, however, that with perhaps only a single exception, these musicians are not from the areas with which they stylistically associate themselves or even from Ireland itself. Rather, they are for the most part natives of Southeastern Wisconsin who have been introduced to Irish traditional music in the context of late 20 th century revival movements. How then have they come to associate themselves with localized performance styles from Ireland? This thesis analyzes these stylistic associations in terms of the repertory requirements of local dancing, opportunities to hear and be educated in regional styles by visiting musicians, and the availability of stylistically diverse audio recordings. This paper speaks to the ways in which local musics are globalized, but then socially re-localized through affinity-based musical practices, and is based on my extended local involvement as a musician from 2004 onwards, as well as ethnographic fieldwork from 2009 to 2010.",,,
1600,How to Produce a Fantasy World: Henry Darger and American Hobby Culture,"Henry Darger is typically thought of as the archetypal, reclusive Outsider artist. The Chicago artist, who lived from 1892-1973, was orphaned as a child and spent most of his adult life as a janitor for various hospitals. Having severely limited contact with the outside world, he created, in his off-work hours, an exquisitely detailed and complex fantasy world called In the Realms of the Unreal, which was discovered posthumously. Along with the text he composed hundreds of illustrations, which are also autonomous works of art in their own right. Acknowledging his current Outsider status, I ask the question, how much of an outsider was Henry Darger, really? This thesis recontextualizes the work of Darger in a new context, that of early twentieth-century hobby culture. Observing the ways in which his artistic practice reflects a potential link to hobby culture, through its use of models, templates, and production, I seek to assert Darger's place in a larger community. In addition, I tie recurring themes in his text and drawings with contemporary popular literature, such as L. Frank Baum's Oz series and Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. Finally I examine the ways in which this leisure culture reinforces productive work models, bringing a certain work-like practice into the home. The hobby can also be viewed in the context of Darger's art as a kind of self-management or self-regulation. Pushing the limits of hobbydom to the extreme, Darger puts on display the productive ideology of American hobby culture, and consequently, his critical potential as an artist.",,,
1601,Automated Configuration and Deployment of Applications in Heterogeneous Cloud Environments,"Cloud computing is a service-oriented approach to distributed computing that provides users with resources at varying levels of abstraction. Cloud infrastructures provide users with access to self-service virtual machines that they can customize for their applications. Alternatively, cloud platforms offer users a fully managed programming stack that users can deploy their applications to and scales without user intervention. Yet challenges remain to using cloud computing systems effectively. Cloud services are offered at varying levels of abstraction, meter based on vendor-specific pricing models, and expose access to their services via proprietary APIs. This raises the barrier-to-entry for each cloud service, and encourages vendor lock-in. The focus of our research is to design and implement research tools to mitigate the effects of these barriers-to-entry. We design and implement tools that service users in the web services domain, high performance computing domain, and general-purpose application domain. These tools operate on a wide variety of cloud services, and automatically execute applications provided by users, so that the user does not need to be conscientious of how each service operates and meters. Furthermore, these tools leverage programming language support to facilitate more expressive workflows for evolving use cases. Our empirical results indicate that our contributions are able to effectively execute user-provided applications across cloud compute services from multiple, competing vendors. We demonstrate how we are able to provide users with tools that can be used to benchmark cloud compute, storage, and queue services, without needing to first learn the particulars of each cloud service. Additionally, we are able to optimize the execution of user-provided applications based on cost, performance, or via user-defined metrics.",,,
1602,X-Band EPR Spectrometer with Customizable Arbitrary Waveform Generator based on a 1 GHz DAC Board,"We present an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer featuring an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) operating at 8--10 GHz (X-band) and based on a 1 GHz digital-to-analog converter (DAC) board with a 42 dB (i.e. 14-bit) dynamic range, which was developed to widen the scope of pulsed EPR and enable new experiments. This spectrometer generates shaped pulses with precise amplitude and phase control and can specify pulse lengths and delays with a time resolution of _250 ps. We demonstrate the capabilities of the spectrometer by presenting spin-echo measurements that implement an entirely digitally controlled and calibrated 16-step phase cycle and by measuring the excitation profiles seen by the spins in the microwave resonator as they respond to various pulse shapes, including rectangular, triangular, Gaussian, sinc and adiabatic rapid passage waveforms. Potential applications of these capabilities, and their implementation in commercial instrumentation will be discussed.",,,
1604,Dynamic metropolitan landscapes: Residential development and vegetation change in the U.S,"Residential development is now a major contributor to land surface change in the U.S. From 1990 - 2000, over thirteen million housing units were added to the nation's housing stock which stood at 102.3 million in 1990. Another 15.8 million housing units were added from 2000 - 2010. Of particular concern is the ongoing increase in low-density residential development because of its large resource footprint and biodiversity impacts. In this dissertation I pose three broad questions 1) What were the trends in residential development in the U.S. from 1990 - 2000? 2) What were the trends in rural conversion to low-density residential use from 1990 - 2000 in the Mid-Atlantic and the Pacific Northwest and what social and environmental factors help explain these trends? 3) What were the effects of rural conversion to residential use on vegetation productivity in the Mid-Atlantic and the Pacific Northwest from 2000 - 2010? To answer these questions I created a database derived from U.S. Census blocks that allows for interdecadal comparison of recent housing density change in support of spatial demographic research. In a series of GIS based analyses I used the database to map changes in metropolitan housing density distributions in the Mid-Atlantic and western Washington regions and used a satellite derived index of vegetation productivity to assess the impacts of housing growth on vegetation carbon uptake. Results indicate that residential housing growth is more dynamic than previously thought and established approaches for mapping housing density tend to underestimate the local intensity of residential change. In the Mid-Atlantic and western Washington, low-density residential development is affecting large fractions of rural landscapes in metropolitan areas. The strongest correlates of low-density conversion of rural landscapes were population growth and extent of protected lands, suggesting future directions for modeling the drivers of rural conversion. Residential development in the rural landscapes of the Mid-Atlantic and western Washington reduced mean and maximum vegetation productivity from 2000 - 2010. The influence of residential development on maximum productivity was particularly evident in Mid-Atlantic deciduous forests. As a whole the findings reveal continued metropolitan decentralization which is associated with reductions of vegetation productivity in forest ecosystems of the Mid-Atlantic and western Washington.",,,
1605,Diversity and Equalization for MultiGigabit Millimeter Wave Communications over a Sparse Multipath Channel,"We undertake a fundamental investigation of diversity and equalization over highly directional links in the millimeter (mm) wave band. Our focus is on outdoor links using the 60 GHz unlicensed spectrum. Such links could be used to form wireless mesh networks with multiGigabit data rates. The use of directional transmission and reception contributes to a few strong paths which fall within the transmit and receive antenna beamwidths. We find that such sparse multipath channels require new design approaches relative to design of conventional wireless links in rich scattering environments. We investigate spatial and frequency diversity for such highly directional links for which the number of dominant paths is significantly smaller than for the scattering environments seen by omnidirectional links. While fading can still be severe, we observe that the channel statistics are very different from classical Rayleigh or Rician fading models, and are characterized by the variations in a small number of parameters characterizing the propagation geometry. While our findings are quite general, our specific focus is on modeling outdoor millimeter wave lamppost-to-lamppost links in an urban environment (e.g., for multiGigabit mesh networks using 60 GHz unlicensed spectrum). We show that it is possible to design quasi-deterministic diversity strategies such that geometric configurations which result in destructive interference are unlikely. The rules of thumb regarding antenna spacing and bandwidth differ significantly from those for standard rich scattering models, and outage probabilities of the order of 10-4 or less can be obtained with small link margins (a few dB) relative to a line-of-sight (LoS) link. Commercial exploitation of such multiGigabit mesh network at 60 GHz band requires that we take advantage of the low-cost digital signal processing (DSP) made available by Moore's law. A key bottleneck, however, is the cost and power consumption of high-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) at the multiGigabit rates of interest in this band. This makes it difficult, for example, to apply traditional DSP-based approaches to channel dispersion compensation such as time domain equalization or Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), since these are predicated on the availability of full-rate, high-precision samples. We investigate the use of analog multitone for sidestepping the ADC bottleneck: transmissions are split into a number of subbands, each of which can be separately sampled at the receiver using a lower rate ADC. Given the large coherence bandwidth of the sparse multipath channels typical of such highly directional outdoor 60 GHz links that we consider, reliable performance requires spatial diversity, in addition to the beamforming required to close the link. We therefore consider one transmit and two receive antenna arrays, each with 4 x 4 elements. We find that exploiting spatial diversity completely by combining samples from both arrays is critical for combating fading and inter carrier interference.",,,
1606,Student Affairs Standards and Competencies: Examining the Professional Standards and Competencies of California Community College Student Government Advisors,"The purpose of this study is to examine the professional standards and competencies that California community college student government advisors perceive as important, their confidence level in those professional standards and competencies and the role that they believe professional organizations can play in developing those skills. This study explores California community college student government advisors' knowledge of professional competencies and standards and how critical they are to their success in their job. In addition, this study examines the role professional associations have in the development and training of professional standards and competencies and utilizes the professional standards and competencies identified by multiple professional associations and higher education literature. In this study I employ a survey instrument that I designed as the primary data-gathering instrument. The focus of the survey was to gather information regarding student affairs professional standards and competencies, student government advisors perceptions of standards and competencies, and the role of professional associations. The online survey was distributed to student government advisors within the California community college system. After all survey responses were collected, I examined the overall responses to the questions and how they inform the research question. However, question-by-question tabulations can hide critical information about how different groups and sub-groups may respond. Therefore, after completing the initial analyses, I pursued cross-tabulations, chi square analyses and independent t-test analyses for a more comprehensive picture of student government advisor's knowledge of, training in, and confident around their professional competencies. This study should provide guidance to advisors and professional associations in the development of standards and competencies for student government advisors. Overall this study had several key findings. First, I found that while there was a great deal of overlap between the research literature on professional competencies and the professional standards, there were also broad areas of disagreement among the professional organizations and between the organizations and the research literature. Second, I found that a gap exists between respondent's rating of the importance of specific professional standards and their competence with those same standards---suggesting areas for professional training. Finally, there were clear differences by advisor experience with those who had advised student government for more than five years more likely to report a higher confidence level than those who had fewer than five years of advising experience.",,,
1607,Exploring the impacts of over two decades of experimental warming on an arctic tundra ecosystem,"Arctic soils are among the largest stores of organic carbon globally. Because rapid arctic climate warming is predicted to promote decomposition while also stimulating plant growth and increasing woody plant dominance, there is great interest in developing mechanistic descriptions of the system's carbon dynamics as it responds to warming. I used the Toolik Long Term Ecological Research site moist acidic tundra greenhouse experiment, which was established in 1989 and is the longest continuously running tundra warming experiment in existence, to explore the consequences of long-term warming on tundra biogeochemical dynamics. Warming increased plant biomass and woody plant dominance; however, the tundra soil system proved resistant to carbon loss, which may reflect counterbalancing abiotic and biotic system feedbacks that developed over the course of the treatment. Surprisingly, the greatest biogeochemical changes in the greenhouse experiment were detected at depth. Warming increased the mineral horizon soil carbon stock, thaw depth, decomposer activity, and trophic complexity. By stratifying sampling across season and depth, I found that decomposer activity in the greenhouse deep organic and mineral horizon soils were stimulated during the late winter. This effect was not apparent during the summer and was reversed in the early winter. Therefore, a shift from direct summer warming to indirect winter warming may profoundly affect carbon storage in deeper tundra soils by destabilizing the large permafrost mineral soil carbon pools. Warming simulations using a stoichiometrically coupled, acclimating microbe-plant-soil (SCAMPS) model further supports the possibility that winter warming may more strongly promote tundra soil carbon mineralization than summer warming. Over two decades of experimental summer warming increased ecosystem tundra carbon stocks, because woody plant biomass increased while soil C stocks remained stable. This suggests that warming-driven acceleration of carbon loss from tundra systems may be a transient response that is stabilized over time by a restructuring of the plant and soil communities. At an annual scale, warming-driven, seasonally-linked changes in extracellular enzyme substrate and product availability may create stabilizing feedbacks to warming-driven increases in tundra decomposer activity. As such, these stoichiometrically-constrained feedbacks may ultimately limit warming-driven soil C loss in arctic tundra systems.",,,
1608,Generalized Arithmetic Functions,"In this paper we seek to generalize sigma, the sum-of-divisors function and Euler's totient function, &phis;. These functions, sigma and &phis;, are two of the most well-known arithmetic functions and have been studied extensively. Once we have defined the generalizations, we study some of the properties (in particular, growth rates, multiplicativity, and fixed points) of these generalized functions as well as their products, convolutions, and compositions. It has been noted that there is a dual nature to sigma and &phis;, and we find that this extends well to the generalized versions through the use of conjugate pairs.",,,
1610,Framing Energy Policy: The Effects of American National Identity on Support for Pro-Conservation Energy Policies,"This dissertation aims to address the following puzzle: How does American national identity influence attitudes regarding pro-conservation energy policies? In this dissertation, I build on work showing that frames influence attitudes. I apply the perspective of SIT to the problem. My theoretical perspective is that national identity appeals may be important to explaining public responses to energy policies and issues. Nationalistic framing of energy policies, I will argue, may contextually prime for national identity salience. Specifically, my thesis is that the stronger a person's attachment to national identity, or national identity salience, the more susceptible a person is to pro-conservation energy policy messages that are framed nationalistically. In this way, I use SIT to illuminate some potentially key dynamics in public opinion surrounding energy policies. To test my theory, I employ data from an original survey experiment, in order to examine how participant's national identity salience predicts responses to experimental primes on questions dealing with support for the federal gasoline tax, blame attribution for the BP oil spill, and support for a moratorium on offshore drilling. This survey experiment uses a student sample (n = 315). The treatment involved three nationalistic energy frames with varying in-group and out-group primes. A control group received no identity primes. I also employ data collected from a second original survey experiment using a national sample of adults (n = 246). The second study addresses a secondary research question, which examines the effect of global identity on participant's support for alternative energy options. The second study addresses the topic of this dissertation within the context of contemporary international relations theory. However, the theoretical foundations of both studies are centered on the unifying theme of this dissertation, which is the application of SIT to explain how nationalism and/or nationalistic appeals may influence support for energy policies. The primary contribution of this dissertation is revealing the existence of a relationship between nationalism, framing, and individual-level support for pro-conservation energy policies.",,,
1611,Advancements in Directed Evolution Techniques towards Nucleic Acid Materials with Complex Functionalities,"Over the last few decades, nucleic acids have proven to be an exceptionally versatile material capable of molecular recognition, catalysis, construction of complex patterns, and even nanomechanical motions. In particular, the molecular recognition capability of nucleic acid constructs called aptamers, stands out as a key element because they can serve as a switch to control a wide range of molecular functions that can give rise to novel materials capable of performing complex molecular functions. However, the discovery of such aptamers poses a significant challenge, in large part, due to the lack of an efficient experimental methodology. This dissertation focuses on the development of novel methodologies for generating high-performance aptamers and further nucleic acid materials capable of performing complex functions in a highly controlled manner. I first demonstrate a novel technique that combines the advantages of a volume dilution challenge with microfluidics technology for the rapid isolation of high-performance aptamers. I describe the optimal workflow of aptamer discovery by combining a highly efficient microfluidic selection with high-throughput sequencing and aptamer arrays. Next, I demonstrate a novel in vitro selection method that allows the discovery of aptamers that undergo binding-induced structure-switching and show the generation of structure-switching aptamers capable of biosensing and/or molecular delivery. Finally, I describe an innovative strategy to synthesize hybrid materials capable of performing complex, multi-step molecular processes by integrating these aptamers with polymer materials and demonstrate their use for targeted drug delivery.",,,
1612,"Operationalizing Place: Discovering, reasoning about, and exploring place knowledge from descriptions","Places and place types, such as small town, play a fundamental role in how people organize knowledge about the world. Although places are commonly referenced in human communication, often they are not canonically defined and many of the properties people associate with them have proved difficult to operationalize. In information systems the representation of place knowledge has predominantly focused on either social science metrics or spatial properties such as location and spatial footprint. However, on the web there exist rich datasets containing unstructured natural language texts that are spatially referenced and which provide us with a window to the salient properties of places as people write about them. This research investigates the operationalization of thematic place properties from collections of place descriptions and methods for reasoning with this knowledge in concert with other place information. This work is organized into three main aspects: place knowledge discovery, place reasoning, and the application of the previous two for geographic knowledge exploration. First, a procedure for extracting thematic place knowledge is presented using a novel combination of topic modeling and spatial statistics. The latent topical contents of documents are interpreted as observations at locations or regions and mapped into properties of places. This procedure is evaluated in terms of its utility for estimating the locations associated with non georeferenced texts. Second, a system is developed to automate reasoning about similar and analogous places, and to find real-world analogs to novel compositions of properties and places, such as ""Denver with beaches."" To systematize this reasoning, a novel observation-to-generalization place model that subsumes the digital gazetteer model is defined. This model differentiates between spatial observations of phenomena and place-based generalizations derived from these observations. It forms the basis for a suite of reasoning operations to find place analogs based on sets of invariant properties. In the third part, the engineering and architecture of Frankenplace, an online geographic knowledge exploration tool that utilizes these discovery and reasoning frameworks, is detailed. This application enables a user to explore the topics relevant to a place, find relevant regions based on a thematic keyword query, and search for analogous places.",,,
1613,Development of CMOS integrated nanopore detectors for biomolecules,"One of the key bottlenecks to the widespread use of personalized medicine is the lack of a low-cost, portable and easy-to-use biomolecule detection platform. Recently, solid-state nanopore sensors have attracted significant interest because of their promise in realizing a fast and cheap electronic biosensor, especially for DNA sequencing. Realization of these sensors has faced several challenges, including overall sensitivity of the electronics, size, and cost. A solution to these challenges is the integration of the nanopore sensor and measurement electronics. An efficient integrated platform will reduce the parasitic capacitance of the system, thus enabling a wider bandwidth and a lower noise operation. Apart from greatly enhancing the sensitivity of the nanopore, the integration also drastically reduces the size and cost of the nanopore sensor. This dissertation explores the integration of solid-state nanopores within a Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) platform, in close proximity to the biasing electrodes and custom-designed amplifier electronics. First, we present the fabrication and characterization of solid-state nanopore devices in a commercial CMOS potentiostat chip implemented in On-Semiconductor 0.5 microm technology. Nanopore membranes incorporating electrodes are fabricated by post-CMOS micromachining utilizing the N+ polysilicon/SiO2/N+ polysilicon capacitor structure available in the aforementioned process. Nanopores are fabricated in the CMOS membranes by applying techniques such as transmission electron microscope drilling, focused ion beam drilling and atomic layer deposition. We also describe a method to mass-produce a large of number of electrode-embedded nanopores, with sub-10 nm diameters, across CMOS-compatible wafers by electron beam lithography. The CMOS-compatibility of our fabrication process is verified by testing the electrical functionality of on-chip circuitry. The integrity of both CMOS and CMOS-compatible nanopore devices is demonstrated by measuring the conductance, capacitance and noise characteristics. The functionality of these nanopores is also demonstrated through the detection of 48.5 kbp double-stranded lambda-DNA in 1M KCl under an applied electric field. Second, we propose a novel packaging technology called Versatile Chip-Specific Integration Technology (VCSIT) in order to realize a commercial fully-integrated CMOS nanopore sensor. If CMOS nanopore sensors are to be used in portable applications, they need to be integrated with a fluidic environment, via microfluidic channels, that enable the introduction of biomolecules to the on-chip sensor. The major bottleneck in microfluidic-CMOS integration is that the footprint of microfluidic systems generally exceeds the size of CMOS chips. In order to facilitate the fluidic integration, the chip area needs to be increased to match the size of microfluidic systems. To prevent the higher cost and lower yield that is associated with the increased CMOS chip area, we use the VCSIT process that enables a small foundry-fabricated die to be embedded in a large substrate and planarized. Electrical interconnects are then patterned to wire the CMOS die to large scale pads which can be easily connected to the outside world. A microfluidic channel is then integrated on the encapsulated chip by mechanical clamping or soft lithography techniques.",,,
1614,Towards Practical Privacy-Preserving Internet Services,"Today's Internet offers people a vast selection of data centric services, such as online query services, the cloud, and location-based services, etc. These internet services bring people a lot of convenience, but at the same time raise privacy concerns, e.g., sensitive information revealed by the queries, sensitive data being stored and processed in the cloud, and fine-grained location information disclosed to location-based applications. Privacy protection is desired to improve user satisfaction as well as to allow broader adoption of these internet services. However, there is usually a conflict between service functionality, performance and privacy protection. Privacy-preserving cryptographic protocols provide strong privacy, but have limited functionality and impractically expensive performance. Real internet services and applications seldom consider and incorporate privacy protection. A good balance between service functionality, performance and privacy protection is needed, so that adequate privacy can be preserved while minimally affecting functionality and performance. This dissertation shows that using cryptographic techniques alone could be difficult to deliver a practical privacy-preserving system. With selective use of cryptographic techniques and other privacy-preserving techniques and design choices, it is possible to provide reasonably strong data security and privacy while adequately supporting practical functionalities and performance for privacy-preserving data centric services. We propose practical privacy-preserving protocols, algorithms and systems in various internet service settings. Our proposals advance the state-of-the-art of privacy-preserving systems by achieving balanced privacy, performance and functionality together. To provide practical query privacy protection for using online query services, we propose protocols that obfuscate database queries and that process obfuscated queries. Our protocols apply the expensive cryptographic operations selectively on the service data, thus significantly improving performance without linearly degrading privacy. To provide secure management and query processing on relational data in the cloud, we encrypt and disperse the data in the cloud, but build a secure index to allow the processing of various database queries on the encrypted and dispersed data, thus achieving strong data confidentiality and close to real time performance. To provide practical location privacy protection in location-based social applications, we apply user-specific, distance-preserving transformations to location coordinates, and break the association between locations and the corresponding location data, thus protecting sensitive locations and still enabling neighborhood queries and efficient retrieval of location data.",,,
1615,High Performance Semipolar Blue and Green III-Nitride Light-Emitting Diodes,"In this dissertation, we use a combination of simulations and experimental work to study the physics and material properties of nonpolar/semipolar InGaN quantum wells (QWs). Comprehensive studies on epitaxial growths, fabrication technologies as well as device characterizations were carried out to identity and overcome the major challenges for the realizing of high performance blue and green light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The performance of InGaN LEDs is several limited by the combined effects of high indium compositions and polarization-related fields. To minimize these effects, the indium incorporation properties on various nonpolar/semipolar devices were studied by electroluminescence (EL) characterization and x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. In addition, the defect formation mechanisms for high-indium-content QWs as well as the corresponding suppression strategies were also explored for the growth of the high efficiency defect-free semipolar LEDs. The low light extraction (&eegr;extr) was another long-term limiting factor for the efficiency of semipolar/nonpolar LEDs. To circumvent this problem, we show that advanced fabrication techniques of surface patterning with conical features can effectively improve the &eegr;extr and corresponding emission power for semipolar/nonpolar LEDs. Feature pitch, size, and depth were varied to optimize the extraction efficiency. The experimental results were confirmed by the ray tracing simulations. One important feature of semipolar/ nonpolar QWs is polarized spontaneous emission due to the broken symmetry and associated valance band splitting. The optical polarization properties were studied on selective semipolar InGaN LEDs by EL measurement and theoretical calculations (kp method). Strain and the QWs composition profiles strongly affect the polarization properties. By engineering these unique properties, semipolar blue and green LEDs with state-of-the-art performance were achieved. We demonstrate the world's first semipolar blue LEDs with over 50% EQE and first semipolar green LEDs with 30% EQE. We further demonstrate that high emission power (266.5 mW) and high efficiency (45.3%) under high current densities (> 200A/cm2) (i.e., the ""low droop"" operation) can be achieved on these small size (0.1 mm2) semipolar devices. These results prove that semipolar LEDs have the potential to revolutionize the lighting applications with energy efficient and cost effective solutions.",,,
1616,Light extraction from gallium nitride-based light emitting diodes with a noninvasive two-dimensional photonic crystal,"A noninvasive fabrication process involving soft nanoimprint lithography is used to pattern a photonic crystal (PhC) in titania film for enhanced light extraction from a GaN light emitting diode (LED). This technique avoids damaging the LED structure by the etching process, while photoluminescence measurements show extracted modes emitted from the quantum wells which agree well with modeling. A light extraction improvement of 1.8 times is measured using this noninvasive PhC. Contacts are made on the LED structure without PhC. The device works properly and shows good electrical properties. A drop in the external quantum efficiency is observed under high forward bias and is attributed to Auger recombination processes.",,,
1617,Above and Beyond: Undergraduate Latinos Aspirations to Pursue Graduate Education,"Latinas/os are the largest and fastest growing minority group however they still remain the smallest group to complete graduate program in the United States (Fry, 2004; NCES, 2011). Moreover, if the proportion of Latinas/os continues to grow and the post-baccalaureate shortfall persists, a serious shortage of highly educated Latinas/os is likely, limiting the numbers of this group who will be able to assume professional and leadership positions. This dissertation study examined Latina/o undergraduate students to understand their aspirations for graduate and professional education using a sample of undergraduate Latina/o students from the University of California undergraduate experience survey. Structural equation modeling results indicated that Latina/o undergraduate students' perception of access to academic resources and instruction positively predict their aspirations to pursue post-baccalaureate education. Moreover, more positive perceptions of access to academic resources mediate the relationship between students' perceptions of their own pre-college academic abilities and aspirations to pursue graduate education. This comprehensive model is useful to institutions and policy makers as they design, develop, and assess programs to motivate and support Latina/o students in the pursuit of graduate degree enrollment at the University of California. Keywords: Latinas/os, Hispanics, higher education, aspirations, graduate education.",,,
1618,Collective Action and Institutions: The Emergence of Groundwater Governance,"Common-pool resources exhibit characteristics of both private and public goods. Consumed through competitive effort and difficult to exclude from uncoordinated users, common-pool resources are susceptible to over-extraction and create incentives for users to ignore the social costs of their extraction decisions. The common-pool resource literature in recent decades has examined the first-order conditions necessary for institutions to emerge to solve the problems of competitive resource extraction and collective action management. This dissertation advances our understanding of the emergence of common-pool resource management by empirically addressing the factors influencing the decision to develop institutions to address collective action problems. The setting to test the determinants of common-pool resource management comprises the groundwater basins of California. Groundwater basins in the state have competing users, which include urban, agricultural, and environmental constituents. In a semi-arid climate with limited surface water supplies and increasing demand for water resources, basins in California are susceptible to common-pool problems, including overdraft, seawater intrusion, and land subsidence. Unlike most states in the western United States, California does not proactively manage groundwater basins at the state level to address localized common-pool groundwater problems. Instead, local agencies and individual users are left with the choice of whether to collectively bargain and develop the institutional rules for groundwater basin management. This dissertation answers three questions regarding common-pool resource governance that are raised in the California groundwater management example. First, what are the determining factors in the emergence of groundwater management institutions? This research finds that groundwater institutions emerge where common-pool problems are severe and the benefits outweigh the transaction costs of forming and maintaining these institutions. Second, given that local agencies and groundwater users collectively act to manage a groundwater basin, what institutions and formal rules will they adopt? This research finds that pumping restrictions, taxes, and adjudicated property rights are likely in groundwater basins where municipal water supply is the dominant water use, persistent overdraft is an issue, and seawater intrusion is a concern. Finally, negotiations for establishing private property rights to groundwater are examined in California's adjudicated groundwater basins. An analytical framework is developed to test the importance of the concentration of groundwater use, heterogeneity of users, and aggregate number of users in avoiding costly litigation and reaching voluntary agreements in the shadow of the courts. The factors affecting contracting success are ambiguous. This result is explained, however, by legal uncertainty in the state's water rights doctrines.",,,
1619,Popular Street Protest in Vichy France,"My dissertation explores the culture and politics of street demonstrations in Vichy France. I examine why people took to the streets and what prompted protest. I compare and contrast four different types of street demonstrations, their participants, and locales. Students were the first to protest, but I also analyze housewives' demonstrations, demonstrations against labor conscription (the releve and the STO), and patriotic protests on Armistice Day and Bastille Day. I track how French and German authorities sought to prevent street demonstrations and how well their efforts worked over time. I examine the difficulty in protesting under an authoritarian regime and whether demonstrations undermined public support for Vichy. Street demonstrations challenged the regime's legitimacy by questioning whether the French state could garner public support and maintain order. Collective spaces of cities offered French citizens a place to appropriate and give new meaning to everyday acts and rituals. In showing the impact of public dissent against an authoritarian state, I underscore the importance of the street as a space for opposition and contribute to histories that document France's long tradition of popular protest.",,,
1620,Why Can't We Share? After 9/11: The Critical Role of Stakeholders in the Process of Planning Inter-Organizational Information Integration System (IOIS) Change,"The problem of information sharing and coordination was made starkly evident by the September 11th attacks. September 11th illuminated the problems that justice agencies had in sharing information in a timely and collaborative nature without an interoperable data-sharing system. A number of government audits and justice agency leaders have sought to answer why justice information integration change has faced barriers to progress. Often, these reports suggest change implementers improve their attention to stakeholders. There are, however, no suggestions for how stakeholder identification, priority, and accountability can be accomplished. This study is grounded in the proposition that stakeholder prioritization is a critical communication process in efforts to plan and to implement inter-organizational information integration system (IOIS) change initiatives. A case study of the planning processes of a prominent regional justice IOIS program, the Criminal Research and Investigation System (CRIS), serves as the data source for this dissertation. Overall, the results confirm that stakeholder considerations play a primary role in the trajectory of the planning processes and outcomes for implementing an IOIS. Elaborating earlier theoretical and empirical work on stakeholder prioritization, the findings illustrate the complexity of identifying, agreeing upon, and taking into account the needs of salient stakeholders. The data also confirm that stakeholders can be assessed for needed prioritization by power, legitimacy, and urgency. The combination of these characteristics is explained with more detail and used to illustrate the discrepancies between whom implementers say matter and who is really prioritized in formal deliberations. Who or what really counts in change can become unwittingly relegated to the periphery. Identification of four stakeholder paradoxes and related dualities revolving around self-interest, representation, decision style, and voice shed light on the communicative dynamics associated with ""being stuck"" in planning change rather than moving forward toward the IOIS change goals. In general, the data reveal that throughout the history of the CRIS program, these dualities both enabled and constrained change. Overall, these findings show that stakeholder analysis that surveys decision making against agreed-upon stakeholder prioritization can help implementers overcome the complexity of managing stakeholders and associated paradoxes that arise in complex IOIS change.",,,
1621,"A Multitemporal, Multisensor Approach to Mapping the Canadian Boreal Forest","The main anthropogenic source of CO2 emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels, while the clearing and burning of forests contribute significant amounts as well. Vegetation represents a major reservoir for terrestrial carbon stocks, and improving our ability to inventory vegetation will enhance our understanding of the impacts of land cover and climate change on carbon stocks and fluxes. These relationships may be an indication of a series of troubling biosphere-atmospheric feedback mechanisms that need to be better understood and modeled. Valuable land cover information can be provided to the global climate change modeling community using advanced remote sensing capabilities such as Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR). Individually and synergistically, data were successfully used to characterize the complex nature of the Canadian boreal forest land cover types. The multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis process was applied against seasonal AVIRIS data to produce species-level vegetated land cover maps of two study sites in the Canadian boreal forest: Old Black Spruce (OBS) and Old Jack Pine (OJP). The highest overall accuracy was assessed to be at least 66% accurate to the available reference map, providing evidence that high-quality, species-level land cover mapping of the Canadian boreal forest is achievable at accuracy levels greater than other previous research efforts in the region. Backscatter information from multichannel, polarimetric SAR utilizing a binary decision tree-based classification technique methodology was moderately successfully applied to AIRSAR to produce maps of the boreal land cover types at both sites, with overall accuracies at least 59%. A process, centered around noise whitening and principal component analysis features of the minimum noise fraction transform, was implemented to leverage synergies contained within spatially coregistered multitemporal and multisensor AVIRIS and AIRSAR data sets to successfully produce high-accuracy boreal forest land cover maps. Overall land cover map accuracies of 78% and 72% were assessed for OJP and OBS sites, respectively, for either seasonal or multitemporal data sets. High individual land cover accuracies appeared to be independent of site, season, or multisensor combination in the minimum-noise fraction-based approach.",,,
1622,"Tunable and responsive neurofilament hydrogel networks - A study of composition and salt-dependent behavior using synchrotron X-ray scattering, optical microscopy, and rheology","Neurofilaments (NFs), the class of intermediate filaments characteristic of neuronal cells, are one of three structural protein groups that collectively form the cytoskeletal network. The active structure that NFs assume in the cell, and that permits them to fulfill their physiological role, is a space-filling expanded hydrogel held together by interfilament associations. These lateral inter- filament associations are predominantly electrostatic and established by the polyampholytic nature of the sidearms, the unstructured C-termini of the three constituent subunits: NF-Low (NF-L), NF-Medium (NF-M), and NF-High (NF-H). Using synchrotron x-ray scattering experiments and rheology, we examine the strength and range of these regulatory electrostatic associations by varying the salinity of the in vitro buffer. Furthermore, motivated by variable in vivo subunit expression in axons versus dendrites that results in variable network packing, reassembled (in vitro ) binary system NF-hydrogels have revealed the different contributions of individual subunits to interfilament interactions and to network interfilament spacings. Upon varying the monovalent salt concentration of the in vitro buffer for binary (and ternary) NF systems, we discover the presence of three distinct salt-induced phases, with a re-entrant isotropic phase (at intermediate salts &ap; 40mM) that persists between two different liquid crystal nematic phases. Hydrogels in each of these phases exhibit characteristic physical features and mechanical properties, which served as the inspiration for the tri-phase classification system, and that ultimately stem from the defining nature and strength of the interfilament interactions and thus the hydrogels' water retention capabilities. Within the lowest and non-physiologically relevant salt range (&ap; 5mM), the nematic hydrogels are very elastic and brittle, observed for the first time with filamentous protein hydrogels, and display a bluish tint macroscopically as well as enhanced small angle scattering---the BG hydrogels. An increase in sample salt concentration ""melts"" the nematic order, resulting in an isotropic phase at intermediate salts---the IG. The third phase---NG---appears with a further increase in salt concentration, and is also characterized by internal filament order. Interestingly, NF- L homopolymer hydrogels do not abide by the tri-phase classification system in that an isotropic phase is never observed for these gels. In BG, the sidearms are highly charged, stretched, and drive counterion condensation from the buffer. BG hydrogels also have a phenomenal ability to hold their macroscopic shape and are non-sticky with reference to hydrophilic surfaces: self-associations have saturated all the sidearms making them unavailable for non-self interactions. Furthermore, it is this higher energetic barrier (from stronger bond formation) that discourages constituent rearrangement, as would occur as a result of water loss for instance, which could be another reason for the low rate of water loss. Upon melting into IG (&ap; 40mM), the network looses internal order (filament orientation) in an attempt to minimize repulsion, an aspect that is paralleled by the marked increase in the viscous component of the hydrogel, and clears up. The loss of filament orientation, as well as the ensuing loss of extensive sidearm overlap, means that a larger percentage of the sidearms is free from association: this explains the tendency for IG hydrogels to spread along and ""wet"" a hydrophilic glass surface. Furthermore, loss of a non-continuous mesh and the increased flexibility in filament rearrangement (since they are minimally bound by interactions) hastens subsequent gel dehydration. By comparing and contrasting the experimental findings for hydrogels of varied subunit compositions in all three hydrogel phases---BG , IG, and NG---we address the relationship between interfilament association strength and the nature of the resultant network. As such, we can present an image of network substructure and an understanding of how it translates to the observed macroscopic properties. (Abstract shortened by UMI.).",,,
1623,"Big Data Challenges and Opportunities: Information Diffusion, User Behavior, and Informational Trends in Online Social Networks","Social networks have permeated our daily lives. We transmit ideas, innovations, news, and even diseases through them. They affect the products we buy, the languages we speak and the behaviors we exhibit. Given such implications, an accurate understanding of social networks is crucial. In addition, with most social interactions moving online, researchers have access to unprecedented amounts of detailed data about social interactions. Therefore, we are at a point in history in which both the motivation and the opportunity to study social networks is overwhelmingly strong, attracting researchers from various backgrounds to social networks research. Naturally researchers, whether they are from databases, machine learning or theory background, have a tendency to apply techniques from their fields directly to this new paradigm. However, given the interdisciplinary nature of problems in social networks, one view point is insufficient in capturing the essence of these problems. The main goal of this dissertation is to bring knowledge from various backgrounds to tackle problems relating to social networks research. In addition to relying on diverse research fields, we also leverage the power of big data. The unprecedented amounts of data on online human interactions present great opportunities for the study of social networks. As demonstrated in this thesis, big data can help build better models, algorithms and infrastructures in social networks research. The entirety of the vast space of problems relating to social networks research is likely too complex to summarize in one thesis. Instead, we focus on problems relating to information diffusion in online social networks. The overreaching goal of this thesis is to develop useful tools for understanding, managing and reporting on information diffusion by leveraging various research areas such as data mining, statistics, data management, theory and social sciences, rather than relying on only one. While identifying influentials in social networks, we leverage data-driven methods. When modeling diffusion of information and user behavior, we rely on statistical methods and theories from social science literature. Given a solid understanding of information diffusion in social networks, we can focus on various applications. Discrete math optimization techniques provide us an optimal direction to limiting the spread of misinformation in social networks. And finally, we rely on data streams solutions for building an informational trend detection framework in social networks. Throughout our studies, we focus on various networks such as Twitter, Digg, Facebook and the Blogosphere.",,,

Drawing on 5 years of ethnographic data collection, I apply sub-cultural studies literature to show how one communal household in central California operates as an urban tribe. The tribe is an oppositional sub-culture that, through day-to-day practice, constitutes a submerged network of people intentionally contesting cultural codes.",,,
1625,An investigation of the opponent process actions of cocaine on cue-induced drug-seeking behaviors,"The Opponent Process theory of motivation states that any stimulus is capable of inducing diametrically opposite and temporarily dissociated actions. Consistent with this theory, animals traversing a straight-arm alley for intravenous cocaine develop approach-avoidance behavior about entering an environment that has been paired with cocaine, demonstrating that the drug possess mixed positive and negative consequences. While the euphoric nature of cocaine has been extensively reviewed in the literature, considerably less is known about the negative effects of cocaine. The intent of this dissertation was to investigate how the opponent process actions of cocaine-paired cues differentially contribute to drug-seeking behaviors after periods of drug withdrawal. Five studies were designed and executed to address three broad aims: (1) to investigate the relative persistence of the positive and negative associations of cocaine-paired cues in acute models of drug administration; (2) to examine the impact of prior daily extended access to cocaine (a model of addiction) on the sensitivity to the dual and opposing actions of the drug; and (3) to identify anatomical regions associated with the positive or negative effects of the drug. The results of these experiments are reviewed in the context of the current literature on the underlying neurobiology of relapse.",,,
1626,Data and Application Management in an Open Cloud Platform,"Cloud computing has had tremendous uptake in the global market and is expected to grow well into the future. The commoditization of computational and storage resources has given massive capabilities to individuals and companies to acquire such resources on demand, and to relinquish them when no longer required, without the need to budget for additional hardware and management. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) architectures have arisen in the past years to alleviate the burdens of resource management for developers who may now focus strictly on application development. This faster time-to-value has increased productivity for both developers and their respective organizations. Developers no longer have to worry about lower level details such as CPU consumption, bandwidth limitations, memory consumption, and disk usage, as it has been common in the past. The scaling of applications is now the burden of the platform system. PaaS systems have become the operating systems of the datacenter. Our research has been focused on developing a PaaS system which can give the aforementioned attributes in an open and pluggable way. We emulate the Google App Engine PaaS system as it was one of the first to come to market and offered the promise of infinite scalability at the front end of application servers and the backend of large data storage, all powered by Google's robust infrastructure. We call our PaaS solution AppScale. AppScale is an open cloud platform capable of transparently executing Google App Engine applications at scale and without modification. AppScale is a cloud-based web framework which provides multiple services that provide cloud infrastructure control, data persistence, caching and a number of other common application technologies. AppScale both simplifies and facilitates the benchmarking of the execution of scalable cloud technologies using real applications. This Ph.D. thesis discusses the design, implementation, and evaluation of App-Scale. It considers the many components of AppScale with a focus on the data management layer for scalable storage, transaction semantics, scalable queries, analysis of ""Big Data"", and live migration support.",,,
1627,From Biological Systems to New Materials and Methods,"Nature has developed an array of mechanisms and structures that are necessary for survival. They allow biological systems to fly, eat, survive harsh intertidal zones, walk on vertical surfaces, and many other processes. Not only are the abilities to perform these activities impressive, but their synthesis is impressive from a materials science stand point. The integration and implementation of the mechanisms and structures happens under mild reaction conditions: ambient temperature, atmospheric pressure, and in the presence of water and oxygen. Studying nature has proven to be an enticing inspiration for developing new materials. In this work we focus on energy dissipation mechanisms found on nature for new polymeric materials. The mechanisms of interest are gradients, hierarchical structures and metal-ion coordination, which can be used to improve the toughness of materials. These mechanisms are applied to polyurethane foams and to a thiol-ene based network. The most promising results come from the integration of metal-ion complexation into a thiol-ene network. We were able to create a tunable network for improved stiffness, toughness, and breaking strain. Additionally, it is useful to understand the chemistry of prevalent moieties found in nature. Extensive biological cross-linking for hardening is done using catechol and quinone functionalities. Chemoselective addition of organometallic reagents to 3-benzyloxy-1,2-o-quinone are described. Various nucleophiles are shown to undergo selective 1,2-addition, 1,4-addition, and etherification. Selective 1,2-additions provide stable, non-dimerizing o-quinols as a novel alternative to oxidative dearomatization.",,,
1628,Highly Scaled N-polar Gallium Nitride MIS-HEMTs,"The object of the research presented in this dissertation is developing a new type of transistor to be used in millimeter-wave monolithic integrated circuits (MMICs) for efficient power amplification in the W-band (75--110 GHz) and mm-band (110--300 GHz). Highly scaled N-polar GaN HEMTs (nitrogen-polar gallium nitride high electron mobility transistors) with novel low-parasitic T-gates were developed. It is well known that the large band gap and relatively high electron velocity of the GaN material system make GaN HEMTs excellent candidates for high-speed, high-power applications. However, it is less well known that N-polar GaN [0001] has a number of materials and device advantages over the more mature and widely adopted Ga-polar GaN [0001] material system. These advantages include improved modulation efficiency and two-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG) confinement, lower sheet resistances in vertically scaled GaN channels, and lower contact resistances. These allow N-polar GaN HEMTs to be scaled with more immunity to short-channel effects than Ga-polar HEMTs. Combining these N-polar GaN materials advantages with the advanced device design and technology developed in this dissertation, the HEMTs reported here demonstrate high gain, high frequency performance, high current, high breakdown voltage, low on-resistance, and relatively low dc-RF dispersion---all of which are required for efficient high-frequency power amplification. Devices made on both PAMBE (plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy) and MOCVD (metal-organic chemical vapor deposition) material with a newly designed (n+ GaN)/(UID GaN) ohmic re-growth scheme were investigated. Device performance highlights include 1650 mS/mm extrinsic transconductance (GaN record); 405 GHz maximum oscillation frequency fmax (GaN record); 2.1 A/mm saturated drain current density (achieved at 0-V gate bias) with threshold voltage of -1.8 V; 190 V/microm device breakdown; and 0.25 &ohm;-mm on-resistance (GaN record). A technique for accurately aligning these novel sub-100-nm T-gates in sub-200-nm source-drain regrowth regions was developed, which enabled the investigation of the effect of source-gate and source-drain spacing on device performance. Correlations between device dimensions and performance were examined, including a physics-based explanation of the tradeoffs in device design. This resulted in a clarified understanding of the device operating space, and showed how both high fT and high fmax may be obtained at the same bias point. Using a T-gate with an 85-nm gate length, an fT of 163 GHz and fmax of 405 GHz were obtained simultaneously. Moreover, the dimensions of the tall-stem T-gate structure were examined in order to simultaneously minimize gate parasitic capacitance and gate resistance, which are necessary for obtaining both high fT*Lg (cutoff frequency-gate length) values and high fmax values. The highest fT obtained using this process was 200 GHz with a 70-nm gate (14 GHz-microm) which is unprecedented for a gate of this length. This work shows how N-polar HEMTs with f T and fmax values above 600 GHz may be obtained.",,,
1629,"A modular, multivalent, and multifunctional vaccine platform based on self-assembled peptide amphiphile micelles","Peptides are capable of stimulating an immune response but are generally weak immunogens on their own and require strong adjuvants to be effective, prohibiting their use in clinical applications. Peptide amphiphiles (PAs), which consist of a hydrophilic peptide conjugated to a hydrophobic lipid or fatty acid tail, self assemble into micelles that have distinct advantages for a safe and effective antigen delivery system. PA micelles display a high density of peptide antigen and can be efficiently taken up by immune cells. Multiple functionalities can be incorporated into the micelles in a modular fashion by simple mixing of the different molecules, alleviating the need for complex chemistries to covalently link different components. Two different PA vaccines have been developed to evaluate the potential of PA micelles to serve as a platform for immunotherapy. PAs containing a cytotoxic T-cell (Tc-cell) epitope derived from the model tumor antigen ovalbumin stimulate a Tc-cell response, providing protection in mice against tumor growth. Other PAs incorporating an antigenic sequence found in Group A Streptococcus induce a strong, peptide-specific antibody response in mice. The antibody response was further enhanced by using amphiphilic Toll-like receptor agonists to make mixed micelles. This dissertation describes the design and physical characterization of the PA micelles, and presents an analysis of PA-induced immune responses and possible mechanisms of action.",,,
1630,Part One: Toward the Transcendental Structures of Music; Part Two: A Portfolio of Compositions,"Part One: The author introduces and explores the concept of ""transcendental structure,"" which is the structure that overcomes itself to reach a certain visionary state. The author has strived for the artistic state through working on a variety of projects of both acoustic and electoacoustic music. The first chapter, with detailed analyses of the two major orchestral pieces the author composes in 2008-11, demonstrates the strategy to construct the musical structures and how they deconstruct themselves in order to generate new metaphysical dimensions beyond their own structural domains. In the first piece, Passacaglia di Fibonacci (2008-10), the meticulously complex structures based on the Fibonacci sequence sublimate themselves into the organic construction that involves the phonetic mechanism to make the orchestra ""pronounce"" the name, ""Fibonacci."" The second piece, Menetekel : ""Ah, inu. Amen."" (2010-11), establishes the webbed structure that networks the words and their corresponding musical ideas in sarcastic ways. The second chapter, in contrast, explains and discusses the electronic sound synthesis technique, Compression Feedback Generation Synthesis, which the author has developed since 2006. Though the variety of projects, the author takes advantage of the powerful sounds that the feedback systems generate and demonstrates the technique's potentials to be combined with more conventional techniques such as filtering, FFT, convolution, granular synthesis, ring modulation, and so on. Also in conceptual levels, the system to generate physical feedback loops can expand and transcend itself into the multi-dimensional circular complex through the processes it is combined with the systems in order to network performance feedback, audience feedback, visual feedback, spatial feedback, and/or even Nietzschean eternal cycle that is interpreted as temporal feedback.

1631,Measuring the Impact of a Low-Cost Wheelchair Distribution in Southern India,"According to a report by the World Health Organization, 65 million people worldwide need wheelchairs to regain mobility. Many of these people are unable to afford the devices they need and current makeshift solutions are unsuitable for a variety of reasons. I am a volunteer for Intelligent Mobility International (IMI), a non-profit that seeks to address this situation by producing and distributing durable, inexpensive wheelchairs in the developing world. This thesis designs a study to gauge the impacts receiving an IMI wheelchair has on the lives of people with disabilities and their families. This measure can then be used in the future when Intelligent Mobility evaluates different program options and demonstrates to funders the positive impacts of their donations. The study involves a randomized field trial in Tamil Nadu, India. Candidates for the trial will be identified by a local grass roots organization and verified by IMI to be appropriate candidates for the wheelchair. A total of six hundred candidates will be chosen to represent a good mixture of gender, education, household size and age of the target population, and then randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. Participants in the treatment group will receive a wheelchair at the start of the year and those in the control at the end of the year. The two groups will then be surveyed on many dimensions of their lives using both open-ended ethnographic interviews and a numerical categorical survey both at the start of the year and the end of the year to estimate the impacts of the wheelchair. The ethnographic interviews will help ensure that the participants' views are captured accurately and will permit a more realistic interpretation of the study's qualitative results. The study design also reviews current literature on disability in India, the plan for implementation of the study, the methodological concerns in the design, and the ethical considerations involved.",,,
1632,"Implications of Engineered Nanomaterials in Marine Coastal Ecosystems: Fate, Transport, and Toxicity","Nanotechnology, the ability to manipulate matter at the atomic scale, is being hailed as the next industrial revolution. While engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) possess incredible electronic, thermal, catalytic, optical, and mechanical properties, making them useful in a wide variety of processes and products, their potential ecological consequences have yet to be understood. Adding to this problem are the wide variety of ENMs being created and the inability of current toxicological methods to evaluate them all before they become problematic. For my work, I chose to examine the toxicity of three ENMs, ZnO, CuO, and carbon nanotubes, which are considered to be the most toxic based on previous studies, by evaluating their impact on a marine mussel, an organism that is central to marine coastal ecosystems. I use standard toxicological methods, along with physiological and demographic measurements, as well as fate and transport studies, and regression modeling to understand 1) the impact of ENMs on individual mussels, 2) the ability of mussels to influence ENM transport in marine environments, 3) the potential impact on mussel bed communities, and 4) the potential for trophic transfer of ENMs. I found that these ENMs are toxic to marine mussels but require levels probably not yet found in the natural environment. However, mussels are able to influence the fate and transport of ENMs by concentrating and depositing them in mussel beds, creating extremely toxic levels that will undoubtedly impact infaunal communities. Additionally, mussels accumulate all three ENMs during exposure, creating a potential route of exposure to mussel predators. While current regulations do not consider particle size when evaluating the safety of chemical substances and group most ENMs with their larger counterparts, my work, as well as that of other researchers, suggests that ENMs behave differently and need to be classified separate from larger forms.",,,
1633,Consequences of Pathogen Spillover for Plant Diversity in Invaded Grasslands,"Plant pathogens are extremely common in natural plant communities, and can affect plant population dynamics by reducing growth, fecundity, or survival. Pathogens that differentially harm plant competing species may impact the outcome of competition, and therefore plant diversity within host communities. However, the range of potential pathogen impacts on plant communities remains poorly understood. In this work, I examine how pathogens can affect the diversity of plant species by (i) reviewing the literature, (ii) surveying fungal seed mortality in the field, (iii) analyzing a two-host-pathogen model, and (iv) parameterizing the model in the field. The review yielded a range of mechanisms by which pathogens affect plant communities, but no study actually demonstrated pathogen impacts on key criteria for coexistence. One mechanism, pathogen spillover, in which a reservoir host species builds up high densities of a pathogen and drives infection in a second host species, was particularly poorly understood both theoretically and empirically. Intuitively, one might expect that spillover would benefit the reservoir host to the detriment of the non-reservoir host. To test this hypothesis, I examined the impacts of spillover in cheatgrass-invaded grasslands in the western U.S., using a theoretical model that I then parameterized with empirical data. Cheatgrass reaches extremely high densities and promotes a fungal seed pathogen that also infects the seeds of native grass species. The model revealed, counter-intuitively, that the pathogen can favor the reservoir host (cheatgrass), the non-reservoir host (native grass), both species, or neither species, and that species-specific transmission and tolerance are the key traits determining the outcome. The empirically-fitted model demonstrates that the pathogen benefits the native grass and harms cheatgrass, despite pathogen spillover. More broadly, this suggests that pathogen spillover does not necessarily imply a net benefit the reservoir host. Because the field survey of seed mortality showed an important role of soil fungal pathogens---many of which may be generalists---pathogen spillover may be an important and overlooked driver of the outcome of competition in many plant communities. Understanding the pathogen impacts on plant communities is an important goal for conservation and for mitigating the impacts of invasive species.",,,
1634,Micro-Macro Simulations of Liquid Crystalline Polymers,"We present a numerical method to evolve the flow dynamics of a model for nematic liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) in a recirculating cavity flow, coupling the Doi model for the microstructure of the fluid with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations of motion. In particular, we model the flow dynamics of a LCP confined to a square channel with a lid moving at a constant speed under the simplifying assumption that there are no spatial gradients in the direction of the channel's length, i.e., the only relevant flow dynamics occur in a 2-dimensional, square flow domain. Flow patterns typical of this system include rotation near the center of the domain, extensional flow near the boundaries, and counter-rotating vortices in the corners. We use the spherical harmonics transform to develop a Fokker-Planck solver to evolve the microstructure and utilize the Projection Method to evolve the macroscopic flow. At increasing Deborah numbers, the model captures the formation of +1/2 and +1 disclinations in the microstructure and suggests four regimes of dynamics of the microstructure: tumbling between two anisotropic layers, stabilization of the tumbling with formation of a +1/2 disclination, destabilization with the formation of a second +1/2 disclination, and re-stabilization. This progression of the dynamics demonstrates a wagging-to-flow-aligning transition at De &ap; 3 rather than at De &ap; 5, as observed experimentally by Larson and Mead [Liquid Crystals, 15 (1993), pp. 151-169]. Furthermore, instead of simply a tumbling-to-wagging transition at De &ap; 2, this model predicts a transition from tumbling to equilibrating at De &ap; 1 and then to wagging at De &ap; 2.",,,
1635,"Polymer Light Emitting Transistors: Control over Charge Injection, Recombination, and Morphology toward High Performance","Light emitting field effect transistors (LEFETs) are a new device class that can clearly turn light on and off without additional driving circuit. Important work was focused on equalizing electrons and holes to maximize the recombination efficiency. However, most semiconducting polymers with visible electroluminescence (EL) are p-type transport materials with well separated HOMO/LUMO energy levels. Single metal contacts cannot efficiently inject both carrier species. Therefore, ambipolar light emitting materials that provide both p-type and n-type transports from identical contacts are attractive. Though outstanding EL efficiency was achieved, ambipolar LEFETs suffer from low brightness because high recombination rate was obtained in the lowest current regime. Very high intensity (8500 cd/m2) was only achieved by applying additional output coupling techniques. Moreover, ambipolar light emitting polymers with decent mobility are extremely rare; seriously limiting Red-Green-Blue colors. Therefore, device architectures that can provide more electronic control on charge transport and injection and more choices for colors were required. We propose three approaches toward better performance; electrical control via device architecture, optical enhancement for output coupling efficiency, and morphologic control achieving long term ordering. Split-gate transistors with separated gate electrodes can control charge injection and enhance the density of weakly transporting carrier species to achieve efficient recombination. An optoelectronic gate can increase output coupling efficiency and brightness. Additionally, introducing long term ordering into bilayer LEFETs can increase mobility, hence, higher current density and emission intensity. Electrical, optical, and morphological improvements toward better performance are presented.",,,
1636,First-principles investigations of conductivity control in wide-band-gap semiconductors,"The wide-band-gap semiconductors GaN, AlN, and ZnO have properties that make them attractive candidates for fabricating light-emitting diodes, laser diodes, transistors and solar cells. With band gaps in the visible and ultraviolet, these materials and their alloys can emit and absorb in important regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Despite the promise of these wide-band-gap semiconductors, their electronic conductivity cannot be completely controlled. In this work, we investigate the lack of conductivity control in these materials using first-principles calculations. We first focus on sources of unintentional n-type conductivity. The sources of such conductivity have long remained unknown, and high concentrations of donors make it more difficult to achieve full control of the conductivity of wide-band-gap semiconductors. We have found that silicon, a common impurity in ZnO, acts as a shallow donor and likely contributes to background n-type conductivity. Another shortcoming of these materials is that they are difficult, and sometimes impossible, to dope p type. This is a major barrier, since optoelectronic devices require both p-type and n-type material. Group-V impurities, which substitute on the anion site, are commonly thought to be attractive p-type dopants, especially for ZnO. We find these acceptors lead to highly localized, atomic-like states, making them ineffective dopants. Nitrogen, often touted as a promising acceptor in ZnO, is instead found to be an exceedingly deep acceptor that cannot lead to p-type conductivity. Carbon, a common impurity in the nitride semiconductors, exhibits similar behavior. We calculate characteristic optical signals for these acceptors, allowing for experimental verification of our predictions. Finally, we investigate how defect-trapped holes can limit the effectiveness of cation-site acceptors. We find that Mg, the only p-type dopant for GaN, features a localized hole despite being an effective acceptor. In AlN, Mg is also highly localized, hampering hole conductivity in this material. In ZnO, Group-I acceptors such as Li, also trap holes, making them inefficient dopants, and limiting the prospects for achieving p-type ZnO. Overall, we find that our results can explain the difficulties in improving the doping efficiency of Mg-doped GaN, and why alternative dopants are not effective. Our results indicate that substitutional acceptors in ZnO are deep defects, and demonstrate why p-type doping of ZnO is currently impossible.",,,
1637,Building better diagnostics through directed evolution of biomolecules and by harnessing ubiquitous technology,"One of the most tangible benefits of scientific research to society is in the field of medicine where novel therapies and diagnostics have extended and improved the lives of billions of individuals. The key to the success of many of these diagnostic methods for past 40 years has been the monoclonal antibody which lies at the heart of clinical analytical methods, has an important emerging role in therapeutics, and is a vital research tool. While tremendously important, antibodies have a number of limitations including high cost, thermal instability, and the requirement that they be generated from cells and animals. In contrast, aptamers are single stranded nucleic acids ligands which offer many advantageous features, including lower cost, thermal stability, and the ability to be chemically synthesized, making them a potential alternative to antibodies. However, two major challenges have impeded their broader use in commercial applications. Specifically, the aptamer generation process requires substantial time and resources, and selections often fail to yield molecules with affinities suitable for high performance diagnostics and therapeutics. Towards both understanding and overcoming these challenges we developed a microfluidic selection process that can be used to obtain high affinity aptamers against diverse protein targets. We also show that affinity can be further enhanced through directed evolution of a DNA scaffold to position multivalent aptamers with atomic level precision. The ultimate goal is the rapid generation of affinity reagents against the entire proteome on demand. But the best performing assays are useless if their cost and complexity curtail their widespread deployment. The best way of solving the unmet diagnostic needs of the next century and beyond will be to leverage existing proven technologies with newer ones which lower the barriers to their widespread use. To that end, we demonstrate that a commodity desktop computer can function as a thermal cycler for PCR with no hardware modifications (PC-PCR). With PC-PCR amplification we can detect pathogenic DNA from whole blood samples without any sample processing and perform rapid post-PCR analysis using an ordinary mobile phone camera. By using a common desktop computer and mobile phone camera, and by avoiding tedious sample preparation, we can accelerate the sample-to-answer process and facilitate the shift of molecular diagnostics out of centralized facilities and closer to the individuals that rely on its results.",,,
1638,Establishing Correlations for Predicting Tensile Properties Based on the Shear Punch Test and Vickers Microhardness data,"A series of mechanical tests was performed on a matrix of pressure vessel alloys to establish correlations between shear punch tests (SPT), microhardness (Hv), and tensile data. The purpose is to estimate tensile properties from SPT and Hv data. Small specimen testing is central to characterization of irradiation-induced changes in alloys used for nuclear applications. SPT have the potential for estimating tensile yield and ultimate strengths, strain hardening and ductility data, by using TEM disks, for example. Additional insight into SPT was gained by performing finite element analysis (FEA) simulations.",,,
1639,Benthic Processes and Overlying Fish Assemblages Drive the Composition of Benthic Detritus on a Central Pacific Coral Reef,"While detrital material has been recognized as an important food source on coral reefs, its role in reef food webs remains unclear. We quantified detritus standing stock and flux rates to the detrital resource pool in two different habitats (exposed forereef and protected backreef) of Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, while also measuring the trophic structure of the overlying fish assemblage. While the standing stock of detritus was 1.6 times higher on the protected backreef than the exposed forereef, input rates were 1.7 to 2.9 times higher on the forereef. These differences can be attributed to both variation in water motion and differential rates of biomass contributions to and removals from this resource pool. We found through stable isotope analyses of delta13C and delta15 N that benthic reef detrital composition is a combination of organic material from pelagic and benthic origins. However, detrital composition varied among reef habitats as would be predicted by spatial differences in the overlying reef fish assemblage. Planktivores were the most numerically abundant guild in the forereef habitat, and stable isotope signatures of detritus reflected a greater input from pelagic sources (i.e., depleted in 13C). In contrast, herbivores and detritivores numerically dominated the backreef habitat, and detrital stable isotope signatures appeared to be predominately of benthic origin (i.e., enriched in 13C). Through total organic carbon and nitrogen analyses we found that benthic detritus may represent a significant nutritional source to benthic communities. Converting total nitrogen into maximum protein estimates, we found high deposition of protein (104-124 mg m-2) and organic carbon (184-190 mg m-2 ) to the benthos, but very low standing stock amounts of these materials. While high water flow rates may explain low standing stocks of detritus in exposed forereef habitats, the lower flow rates in protected backreef habitats suggest that removal of this material is via consumption by abundant roving detritivorous fishes. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that reef fish detritivory represents a significant consumer-mediated energy pathway, promoting nutrient recycling by linking many elements of a complex food web.",,,
1640,Estimation-Theoretic Approaches in Video Compression and Networking,"The focus of the dissertation is on estimation-theoretic approaches in video coding and networking, and in particular on transform and predictive coding, scalable coding and error resilient communication. One main line of research is concerned with the interactions between predictive and transform coding modules in video compression, and means to exploit such inter-dependencies to achieve joint optimality and thereby substantial performance gains. Given the unitary transforms employed in conventional motion-compensated video coding the underlying process can be equivalently modeled as a set of parallel, largely uncorrelated auto-regressive processes in the appropriate transform domain. This point of view eliminates the spatial correlation from temporal predictive coding, and hence opens the door to fully account for and exploit the effects of quantization in the motion compensated prediction loop. The dissertation work builds on this paradigm and demonstrates how several advanced techniques are devised by incorporating information that emerges only in the transform domain within an estimation-theoretic framework, including optimal delayed decoding and transform domain motion compensation. This methodology is further leveraged to impact the problem of scalable video coding, where the enhancement layer has access to very different types of information from the current base layer reconstruction and prior enhancement layer frames, which makes optimal prediction and hence optimal coding a significant challenge. An estimation-theoretic (ET) approach for optimal scalability developed earlier at the Signal Compression Lab showed the feasibility of optimal exploitation of the various sources of information. Taking this ET prediction framework as the initial foundation, the thesis work makes several major advances: (1) It extends the method to enable delayed enhancement layer prediction that incorporates information from future base layer reconstructed frame, often available in typical settings of scalable coding over networks; (2) It derives a solution to the longstanding challenge of applying ET prediction to spatial scalability; (3) The underlying probability model that is conditioned on all the available information, is extended to obtain optimal solutions involving other modules including quantization, entropy coding, and more. The overall methodology thus departs from conventional video coding schemes that treat prediction, transformation, quantization, and entropy coding, as largely separate sequential functional components, and instead offers the effective means for joint optimization of entropy-constrained quantization and arithmetic coding, while fully accounting for hitherto ignored relevant factors, inherent to predictive scalable coding, including information from base layer operation and from enhancement layer motion compensated reference. Experiments demonstrate major coding performance gains over existing standard competitors as well as over the earlier ET prediction approach. Practical deployment of video codecs often requires careful consideration of the impact of the potential channel loss during transmission over packet-based networks, as well as the interaction with subsequent error concealment. Errors due to packet losses propagate via the prediction loop, and can significantly affect the reconstruction quality. A major strategy to achieve error resilience is thus to judiciously select the prediction mode, and other encoding parameters so that the end-to-end distortion (EED) versus rate tradeoff is optimized. Central to this approach is the ability to accurately estimate at the encoder the EED which measures the distortion perceived at the decoder. The recursive optimal per-pixel estimate (ROPE) is an established EED estimation method that recursively calculates the first and second moments of reconstructed pixels via update recursions that explicitly account for the prediction, concealment, channel uncertainties, etc. The applicability of ROPE, however, is inherently limited to account for operations that are recursive in the pixel domain. While this is sufficient for standard video coding schemes, the advanced compression techniques mentioned above effectively operate in the transform domain, which motivates the development of a ROPE-like estimation method that performs its update recursions entirely in the transform domain, and is naturally capable of capturing such transform domain operations, namely, the spectral coefficient-wise optimal recursive estimate (SCORE). It recursively computes up to second moments of decoder reconstructed transform coefficients in rough analogy to what ROPE does per-pixel. The scope of basic SCORE was then extended to encompass ET operations in the setting of scalable video coding. The unified ET framework that incorporates SCORE to optimize coding decisions effectively achieves optimality in both prediction and EED distortion, and considerably outperforms standard codecs whose coding decisions are optimized via ROPE.",,,
1641,Confronting the Stasi Past: The Re-Birth of Democracy and the Death of the East German Secret Police,"Following the fall of the East German government, the activists who helped to precipitate the regime's collapse fought to ensure that the secret police agency, the Ministry for State Security, or Stasi, would be dismantled. I examine the motivations and actions taken by the East German citizens' organizations to make this happen. I argue that without the driving force of the citizens' movements, the Stasi would likely have continued to operate and destroy evidence of its work. I trace the development of the citizens' movements and show how their actions drove the dissolution of the Stasi. I examine the role that certain activists played in forcing the transitional East German and unified German governments to create a law governing the Stasi's files. Without pressure from activists, the law would not have passed. In pushing to preserve the Stasi's files the East German activists continuously inserted themselves into a governmental process. In demonstrating the role of the citizens' movements in the process of building democracy, I emphasize the importance of a multifaceted reckoning with the past that includes the voices of both the government and the people.",,,
1642,Queer Sexualities and Space in Contemporary Latin American Film,"To date, no lengthy study has examined queer sexualities and space in Latin American film. In three chapters organized around different spatial scales, I theorize how spatiality reflects and affects the development and expression of queer sexuality in eight films from throughout Latin America. In the first chapter, I explore public and private spaces in relation to queer sexuality in Francisco J. Lombardi's No se lo digas a nadie (Peru 1998), Tomas Gutierrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabio's Fresa y chocolate (Cuba 1993), and Jorge Fons's El callejon de los milagros (Mexico 1994). I argue that despite their attempts to carve out private spaces---with varying degrees of success---the queer characters in these films are not able to escape the influence of the public sphere and heteronormativity. In Chapter Two, I examine the relationship between queer sexualities and city space. I argue that in Enrique Bochichio's El cuarto de Leo (Uruguay 2009) Montevideo is presented as a sort of utopia, a liberating space for individuals who may choose to come out of the closet. By conflating homosexuality with criminality, Marcelo Pineyro's Plata quemada (Argentina 2000), on the other hand, depicts the traditionally oppressive, unsustainable relationship between the city and homosexuals. In Chapter Three, I explore the use of the body as a space for working through issues of queer sexuality. In the films that I analyze, there is an increasing degree of materialization of the body as space. In Javier Fuentes-Leon's Contracorriente (Peru 2009), the ghost of the protagonist's dead lover serves as a sort of mirror that helps the protagonist cope with his sexuality. In Karim Ainouz's Madame Sata (Brazil 2002), issues of sexual identity, gender, race, and class are consolidated in the body of a cross-dressing performer. In Lucia Puenzo's XXY (Argentina 2007), the concern for the body as space is materialized to the greatest extent. The protagonist is an intersexed adolescent whose body serves as a space that represents not only her internal struggles, but also those of her parents and the society within which she does not neatly fit.",,,
1643,"Moments of Transformation: Gender, Sexuality, and Desire among Partners of Trans Men","This thesis explores the effects of gender transition within romantic and sexual partnerships. I consider in particular how partners of trans men understand their own genders, sexual identities, and desires in relation to their partners. I draw on data from 11 interviews with partners of trans men, nearly all of whom were with their partners through parts of the transition process, as well as data from YouTube videos made by partners of trans men. I present three key sets of findings here. First, I consider the production of divisions between cisgender, genderqueer, and transgender within the context of intimate relationships between trans men and their partners. I consider in particular how partners of trans men who view their own genders as complicated, fluid, or queer construct a division between their experience with gender and their partners' by referring to their own social privileges, in particular their possession of socially intelligible bodies and their lack of body dysphoria. Second, I consider how trans men's partners' understandings of their sexual identities are affected by their partners' transitions. I find that some partners, particularly those who identified as queer, labelless, or with a non-binary sexual identity prior to their partners' transitions, experience no change in their sexual identities as a result of their partners' transitions. Other partners recast their sexual identities in ways that work to affirm their partners' gender identities and even operate to produce their partners' gender identities as essential. I also consider how partners who continue to identify as queer or lesbian following their partners' transitions negotiate the dilemma of inadvertently ""passing"" as straight now that their partners are perceived as men. Finally, I discuss how partners negotiate the experience of being in an intimate relationship with someone who is undergoing the physical processes of gender transition. I find that partners tend to describe their desires shifting along with their partners' changing bodies.",,,
1644,Operando Spectroscopic Investigation of Supported Pd and Low-surface Area Mixed Metal Oxide Catalysts for Automotive Emissions After-treatment,"The catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide remains a topic of active research in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, despite nearly a century of exhaustive characterization. Platinum group metals (PGMs) are most often used industrially for this reaction, and their fully reduced state has long been considered to be the most active. The development of in-situ and operando characterization techniques has led to new insights into the state of the PGM surface during reaction. With these new findings has come contention regarding the most active state of the catalyst during the oxidation of CO to CO2. In this thesis, operando IR and X-ray absorption spectroscopies were used to study CO oxidation in a net oxidizing atmosphere over two initially different forms of a highly dispersed Pd/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst: fully oxidized, and fully reduced. Fully oxidized PdO/Al2O 3 was found to undergo partial reduction prior to the onset of activity, while at light-off, its surface was reoxidized. In the case of fully reduced Pd/Al2O3, the formation of a surface oxide did not occur until above the light-off temperature. Interestingly, at high temperatures and conversions, both catalysts were extensively reoxidized to a disordered, PdO-like phase. When the temperature ramp was reversed, extinction was observed at the same temperature for both catalysts. Both showed hysteresis between their light-off and extinction temperatures, but in opposite directions. The extinction temperature of the catalyst that was initially PdO/Al2O3 was higher than its light-off temperature, i.e., extensive high temperature oxidation had served to decrease activity. However, the same oxide phase showed improved activity relative to Pd/Al 2O3, compared to light-off, suggesting that the disordered oxide is more active than either reduced Pd nanoparticles or ordered PdO nanoparticles. Low surface area mixed metal oxide catalysts are also of interest in the catalytic oxidation of CO, because of their greater resistance to changes in oxidation state and sintering relative to highly dispersed metal nanoparticles. Many types of PGM-doped and un-doped mixed metal oxides have shown high activity for this reaction, including perovskites, pyrochlores, and spinels. In this thesis, the activity of the delafossite CuScO2 in CO oxidation was investigated, using both standard ex-situ techniques and in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. CuScO2 has the ability to intercalate additional oxygen into its lattice, accompanied by oxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II). After exposure to CO/O2 above the light-off temperature, the catalyst had been partially oxidized. In subsequent light-off cycles, activity improved with each cycle. In-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed that, under reaction conditions, oxygen is incorporated into the lattice. Reactor studies of CuScO2 with intercalated with 18O showed that lattice oxygen is available for reaction and is likely the cause of decreased light-off temperature.",,,
1646,Kinematic Earthquake Sources of High and Low Frequencies and Their Relation to Earth Structure,"In this thesis, we studied the earthquake process from a dual perspective: i.e. modeling the complex Earth medium and the earthquake dislocations at the source. These two fundamental aspects define the ground motion. Existing kinematic source models are essentially based on the low frequencies contained in the seismic signals (< 1 Hz). Due to our limited knowledge of the Earth medium, the high frequencies in the seismic signals are difficult to be modeled properly. In order to optimize our understanding of the complex earthquake rupture process, a synthesis of both the Earth medium and source model is required. For modeling the complex Earth medium, we developed a tomographic method that exploits the ellipticity of the fundamental Rayleigh wave (ZH ratio). This method enables us to constrain the shear-wave velocity in a narrower target depth range than conventional methods. The ZH ratio method has been applied to the crust and upper mantle beneath the GEOSCOPE stations. The results show that low-velocity zones exist beneath some stations near hotspots. The ZH ratio was applied to the L'Aquila basin area to constrain the shallow velocity structure prior to a kinematic source inversion of the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake. Because of differences in the slip models derived from seismological or geodetic data, we introduced a new strategy to differentiate between slip that occurs co-seismically and that occurs as early post-seismic afterslip. The results suggest that the co-seismic rupture was followed by a slow-slip event with significant moment release in the first day. Lastly, we discussed the development of a back-propagation method to map high-frequency spatial-temporal seismic wave radiation sources onto the fault plane. The new approach considers the free surface reverberations and the fault geometry while existing methods doesn't. Based on results from a synthetic test, we demonstrate that the new back-propagation method is better than existing back-projection method because it not only can locate the spatial-temporal locations of the target sources but also can fairly well recover their amplitudes.",,,
1647,High Dynamic Range and 3D Video Communications for Handheld Devices,"Handheld devices present a compelling opportunity for ubiquitous video communications. However, inexpensive camera sensors and two-dimensional displays contribute to flat, poorly exposed faces and an unnatural appearance. Our research identifies two requirements of video communications on a handheld device to achieve high quality, natural interaction: high dynamic range (HDR) video and 3D display. Small, inexpensive sensors cannot adequately capture the full brightness range when exposed to uncontrolled lighting environments. Furthermore, HDR video techniques for handheld devices must not increase camera hardware costs or size. Therefore, our research investigates novel post-processing methods to increase the dynamic range of videos captured using alternating short and long exposures. Past software-based methods failed to eliminate all ghosting artifacts introduced by scene and camera motion. Our research contributions include hierarchical block-based motion estimation (ME) between differently exposed frames, bi-directional ME and pixel refinement within poorly registered regions, and spatially adaptive filtering to smooth radiances using reliable edges, producing high quality HDR video for scenes with both moving cameras and fast local motion. Handheld devices with ""glasses-free"" autostereoscopic displays now enable 3D video communications. 3D can enhance realism and enrich the user experience, yet it must be employed without visual discomfort. Display-camera geometry and recent ""zone of comfort"" research underscore the challenge in creating perceptually satisfying and comfortable 3D content for handheld devices. Shift-convergence can minimize disparities within the region of interest, yet this can lead to uncomfortably large disparities in the background. Reducing camera separation, in an attempt to minimize all disparities, may lead to a flat appearance that does not aid realism. Our research explores the unique stereoscopic challenges posed by handheld 3D video communications. We derive camera separations for optimal viewing comfort and realism. A novel bi-layer disparity remapping technique aligns the front of a user's face onto the screen for comfort, while limiting background disparities. Finally, we evaluate results and recommendations with a user study on a current 3D handheld device.",,,
1648,The Pleasure Gap: A Sociological Analysis of Evaluating Female Pleasure in Pornography,"Just as gender scholars have identified gaps in women's experiences with labor (the wage gap and the leisure gap), there is a gendered inequality in sexual experience I call the pleasure gap: a gendered inequality in opportunities to experience pleasure. I argue that pornography viewership provides a strategic way to both uncover and to challenge this inequality. This project explores pornography at the point of consumption, through empirically analyzing how focus group participants respond to and assess different types of pornography. Feminist porn producers have identified the depiction of genuine female pleasure as the primary criterion for distinguishing their work from mainstream pornography. I explore how women spectators assess both mainstream and feminist pornography, particularly the authenticity of the pleasure claimed by female performers' vocalizations. The data show a gendered ""pleasure gap"" in opportunities for women to view and assess pornography, and explores the possibility of feminist pornography as a site of female sexual empowerment.",,,
1649,Exploring Human Decision Making in the Context of Web-Based Public Participation in Transportation Planning,"Commonly, empirical evaluations of complex decision support systems are either suggested as deliverables of future work or limited to the self-reported satisfaction of the systems' users. Although self-reported satisfaction provides one perspective from which to evaluate decision-support systems, it also introduces a conflation of the user's satisfaction related to the decision support system on the one and the decision making process and its outcomes on the other hand. This research explores alternative approaches to the empirical evaluation of decision support systems. The dissertation has two primary objectives. The first is to determine novel analytical methods for the empirical evaluation of web-based decision support systems based on human-computer interaction. The second is to contextualize individual decision making behavior within online transportation planning along the dimensions of egoistic and altruistic decision making. The two objectives are operationalized in three analyses of a web-based decision support system for public participation in transportation improvement programming. In the first analysis, client-server interaction using multiple sequence alignment and hierarchical cluster analysis is evaluated. The findings suggest reliability of the hierarchical cluster analysis classification in regard to overall duration of interaction. In the second analysis, the statistical association of individual level variables and clusters of overall duration of interaction is investigated using logistic regression analysis. The regression results indicate a significant statistical association between overall duration of interaction and prior experience with online transportation discussions. Finally, in the third analysis, the extent to which egoistic and altruistic decision making expresses itself in the transportation project choices of the users of the system is analyzed. The choices are analyzed by examining locations of transportation projects selected by the users and their associated implementation costs in relation to the home, work, and travel locations of the users. The findings evidence user preferences for transportation projects within the vicinity of the individual's home, work, and travel locations as well as cost-aversion behavior in which the majority share of project implementation costs is carried by the average resident rather than the user. These observed behavioral patterns suggest predominately egoistic choice making behavior of the analyzed individuals.",,,
1650,This Charming Symmetry of Contradictions: The Arabesque and the Emerging Bourgeois Family in Philipp Otto Runge's Fall of the Fatherland (1809),"In Fall of the Fatherland, a pen and ink drawing of 1809 by Philipp Otto Runge (1777-1810), the ""fallen fatherland"" of the work's title is traditionally understood as the dead young man, buried under the land upon which his widow guides a plow with the help of Amor. Conventionally, the image has been interpreted as early evidence of growing nationalist sentiment among German lands in response to Napoleon's occupation. Virtually unknown during Runge's lifetime with its first publication dated to 1841, the image situates the tragic consequences of the Napoleonic occupation not on a battlefield of wounded soldiers and fallen horses but rather within the context of a catastrophic loss to the family. Thus, while not disregarding the long-standing nationalist reading of the work, this thesis argues for a new interpretation of Runge's Fall of the Fatherland that emphasizes the arabesque as a carrier of critical meaning. The artist's modern and subjective use of the arabesque is examined within the context of two late eighteenth century treatises. Further, Fall of the Fatherland is investigated for its articulation of changing notions of family and marriage in bourgeois Hamburg at the start of the nineteenth century, particularly the growing incongruence between private and public spheres. Like the arabesque which travels both inside and outside of the pictorial space, the bourgeois family traversed a boundary between public and private, its public obligations in tension with the realm of domesticity.",,,
1651,Integrated Photonic Comb Generation: Applications in Coherent Communication and Sensing,"Integrated photonics combines many optical components including lasers, modulators, waveguides, and detectors in close proximity via homogeneous (monolithic) or heterogeneous (using multiple materials) integration. This improves stability for interferometers and lasers, reduces the occurrence of unwanted reflections, and it avoids coupling losses between different components as they are on the same chip. Thus, less power is needed to compensate for these added losses, and less heat needs to be removed due to these power savings. In addition, integration allows the many components that comprise a system to be fabricated together, thereby reducing the cost per system and allowing rapid scaling in production throughput. Integrated optical combs have many applications including: metrology, THz frequency generation, arbitrary waveform generation, optical clocks, photonic analog-to-digital converters, sensing (imaging), spectroscopy, and data communication. A comb is a set of optical sources evenly spaced in frequency. Several methods of comb generation including mode-locking and optical parametric oscillation produce phase-matched optical outputs with a fixed phase relationship between the frequency lines. When the absolute frequency of a single comb line is stabilized along with the frequency spacing between comb lines, absolute phase and frequency precision can be achieved over the entire comb bandwidth. This functionality provides tremendous benefits to many applications such as coherent communication and optical sensing. The goals for this work were achieving a broad comb bandwidth and noise reduction, i.e., frequency and phase stability. Integrated mode-locked lasers on the InGaAsP/InP material platform were chosen, as they could be monolithically integrated with the wide range of highly functional and versatile photonic integrated circuits (PICs) previously demonstrated on this platform at UCSB. Gain flattening filters were implemented to increase the comb bandwidths to 2.5 THz. Active mode-locking with an RF source was used to precisely set the frequency spacing between comb lines with better than 10 Hz accuracy. An integrated optical phase-locked loop (OPLL) for the comb was designed, built, and tested. The OPLL fixed a single comb line to a stable single linewidth laser, demonstrating a _430 Hz FWHM optical linewidth on the locked comb line and 20_ RMS phase deviation between the comb and optical reference. The free-running linewidth is 50--100 MHz, demonstrating over 50 dB improvement in optical linewidth via locking. An integrated tunable laser (SG-DBR) with an OPLL was phase-locked to a comb source with a fixed offset frequency, thus showing the potential for using a comb with SG-DBRs as a compact frequency synthesizer.",,,
1653,Energy-efficient Large-scale Computing,"Large-scale computing can be used to characterize the host infrastructures of internet-services, social networks and cloud services, the growing pervasiveness of which has been undeniable in recent years. Although the utilization of these services has triggered significant growth in several areas such as science, communication, education and health-care, to name a few, it has not come without a cost. Specifically, the operation of large-scale infrastructures can result in energy consumptions equivalent to the energy budget of a medium-sized city. The deployment of such infrastructures requires hunders of kgs of primary materials and fossil fuels, while releasing significant amounts of CO 2 into the atmosphere. Energy is wasted across all layers of large-scale systems. One significant source of inefficiency is the overprovisioning of the hardware. Internet-services have typically very strict performance guarantees, defined in Service-Level Agreements, which result in overprovisioning of both the computing and the supporting equipment. The manufacturing of the extra equipment is a burden to the environment. The operation of the computing equipment at periods of low-utilization, which is the majority of the time, wastes a lot of energy because server HW tends to be energy-inefficient at low utilizations. Another significant source of inefficiency is the software, which is not designed both to maximize energy-savings and optimize performance. In datacenter planning, industry experts utilize methodologies to calculate the total cost/profit. We propose to include the environmental cost in current methodologies. With this, we demonstrate that large installations can be more energy-efficient compared to smaller ones. To tackle the cluster overprovisioning problem, researchers have proposed both HW and SW solutions. In HW, researchers have proposed the usage of low-power servers which transition all the server components into a low-power state fast. In SW, algorithms which consolidate the load into a subset of servers at periods of low utilization have been proposed. Unfortunately these solutions do not allow access to the memory during load consolidation, even though memory is a critical resource for the performance of internet-services. We propose both a memory-active, low-power family of server states and cluster middleware software which enables the management of the memory during consolidation. Our energy-efficient SW and HW achieve up to 38% energy savings in a datacenter cluster running an internet-service, over an energy-oblivious cluster. At the server level, dynamic power management solutions for the CPU and the DRAM may degrade performance with application complexities, such as highly dynamic loads or strided memory access patterns. We propose an SLA-aware power governor for the CPU and a locality-aware power management technique for the DRAM. Our CPU technique saves up to 8% system energy over the default power governor of the Linux kernel for a highly dynamic enterprise workload, while our DRAM technique improves the ED2 by 21% on average for an enterprise and scientific suite of benchmarks over a static-only power-optimized memory system. Overall, this thesis demonstrates that large-scale systems have the capacibility to be more energy-efficient, so long that energy-efficiency is integrated as a design goal throughout the large-scale system stack.",,,
1654,"Characteristics of High Achieving, Low- and Moderate-Income African Descent College Students","This qualitative study describes the experiences of high achieving, low and moderate-income African American students who have matriculated in a selective university. In order to address my research questions, I asked open-ended, semi-structured interview questions regarding students' past academic behaviors; academic achievement; and their perceptions of how peers, schools, and family functioned as either barriers or support systems. This qualitative inquiry used analytic procedures suggested by a grounded theory approach. Findings to date indicate that academic competition among peers and challenging coursework can be a protective factor for high achievers and can help improve grades, and involvement in sports activities can be both a protective factor and a risk for academic failure.",,,
1655,"Modeling Fluid-Rock Interaction, Melt-Rock Interaction, and Silicate Melt Properties at Crustal to Planetary Interior Conditions","Investigation of the differentiation of mantle lithosphere and asthenosphere and growth of continental and oceanic crust requires a thorough understanding of mineral, melt and fluid phase relationships and physical properties from ambient to high-pressure-temperature conditions, often beyond experimental capability. Beyond what we can learn directly from seismological techniques or from deep materials transported to the Earth's surface, we rely heavily on a combination of theory-based extrapolation of material properties and computational simulation of geomaterial properties at deep Earth conditions. To help achieve these ends, my research has dealt with the thermodynamics and transport properties of some high-PT geosilicate systems. In particular, (1) a new thermodynamic model has been developed for mineral solubility in aqueous (H2O-rich) fluids at pressures up to 5 GPa (e.g. mantle metasomatism and partial melting in subduction zones) based on Generalized Born theory using a simple model that relates mineral solubility to the dielectric constant of supercritical H2O, (2) results for the Equation of State, structure and transport properties from 0--30 GPa and 2000--5500 K for liquid CaMgSi2O6, an important component of the mantle based on Molecular Dynamics simulations are presented, (3) phase-equilibria based simulation results representing the behavior of a set mafic magma types in response to contamination by mafic to silicic and pelitic country rock via Energy-Constrained Assimilation-Fractional Crystallization (EC-AFC) processes, and (4) Ten new 40Ar/39Ar eruption ages for the western Aeolian Islands, southern Italy are presented and utilized to constrain the late Quaternary insular uplift history, demonstrating that all seven islands in this archipelago except Alicudi have experienced a similar uplift rate since c. 125 ka during periods of volcanic quiescence, while uplift/subsidence rates vary dramatically during periods of volcanic activity on the islands of Alicudi and Filicudi.",,,
1656,Adaptation of REMPI Laser Mass Spectrometry for Cultural Heritage,"Scientifically analyzing ancient and unique objects of antiquity such as pottery and paintings is necessary to answer many questions of interest to the field of cultural heritage. This field encompasses diverse disciplines including anthropology, archaeology, conservation and art history. In many instances, it is of interest to identify specific targets or molecular markers to evaluate, for example, what pigment colors a paint layer or what foodstuff pottery may have held. While today's standard spectroscopy and mass spectrometry methods are highly effective, specific questions remain difficult to answer and the development of laser desorbed, jet-cooled, REMPI laser ionized, time-of-flight mass spectrometry (REMPI laser MS) as an alternate analytical technique to simplify and improve cultural heritage object analysis is presented in this dissertation. By combining multiphoton ionization and double resonance spectroscopy with mass spectrometry, both exceptionally well resolved vibronic spectroscopy and fragment-free mass spectrometry for molecules of interest can be performed simultaneously. In doing so, this technique offers two advantages over commercial equipment: First, wavelength selectivity in the ionization step is utilized so that only the analyte of interest is ionized, irrespective of matrix or mixture complexity; this eliminates the need for either sample preparation or chromatography. Secondly, gas phase mass spectrometry allows for immediate differentiation between molecules considered spectroscopically indistinguishable in the aqueous phase based on an inherent characteristic, molecular mass, rather than by often highly variable instrumental parameters, such as retention time. These advantageous characteristics of REMPI laser MS allow smaller sample sizes than commercial MS instruments, which in turn require less damage to objects of cultural heritage. REMPI laser MS was applied as an analytical tool for cultural heritage initially in the fields of archaeology and anthropology, using theobromine and caffeine as molecular markers to identify ceremonial chocolate beverages in Mesoamerican pottery. Preparation of extracts and pottery sherds for analysis, as well as instrumental parameters for the detection of theobromine were optimized extensively. Theobromine in samples from two different Mesoamerican archaeological sites was successfully identified, and this method will be expanded to analyze pottery sherds for wine residues. REMPI laser MS will be applied to the field of art to analyze examine painting cross-sections and threads from tapestries for dye and pigment analyses in a new microscope-REMPI laser mass spectrometer.",,,
1657,Terahertz Absorption in InGaAs quantum posts and exciton tuning in indium arsenide/gallium arsenide quantum dots by electromagnetic fields,"In the first stage of this project, I first grew InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) and incorporated these QDs in a voltage control structure by MBE technique. The electrical or optical injection of carriers induces charged excitons including positive and negative trions. The emissions from these excitons are resolved by micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy. Due to two possible states of electron and hole spins, most excitons in QDs are doubly degenerated. We have removed this energy degeneracy using Zeeman effect by applying a magnetic field in the growth direction. The spin state of the negative trion X- consisting of two electrons and one hole is particularly interesting because of the long coherence time of hole spins. We have completely defined this spin state by measuring the polarization of the emitted photons under applied electromagnetic fields. The goal of the second stage of this project is to increase the intensity of the exciton emissions for applications such as high rate single photon sources or quantum communication at relatively long distances. For this purpose, we have coupled the exciton emission with high quality factor micropillars. The photoluminescence emission from a single QD is thus amplified through the Purcell effect. By including the QD in a micropillar cavity and using the Quantum Confined Stark (QCS) effect, we demonstrated the tuning of the QD emission to the cavity optical modes. Q factors of 10,000 to 20,000 and an experimental Purcell factor of 3.7 were obtained. We have demonstrated a more efficient way of using the QCS effect by growing a microcavity in which two Al0.4Ga0.6As barriers are added below and above the QD layer. This allowed an increase by more than 5 times (up to 6.5meV/V) of the QCS induced energy shift of the QD emissions. The third project deals with the growth and characterization of InGaAs Quantum Posts (QPs). The Quantum Post is a 15nm-60nm height nanowire connecting two quantum dots at its ends. I grew these QPs by MBE technique with and without Al incorporation using a self- assembled growth process. These InGaAs QPs are suitable for applications in the THz range because the transitions between the energy levels in the conduction band of QPs are tunable in the frequency range from 1THz to 10THz. In this work, I have shown experimentally the tuning of these subband energy levels by investigating QPs grown under different conditions. The InGaAs bandgap and the QP height are shown to be critical factors for this tuning. The shape, dimensions and chemical composition of QPs are obtained using electron microscopy techniques. These parameters are important inputs for the sample design and the 8-band k.p theory used to calculate the energy levels of the QPs. Based on our Capacitance-voltage (C-V) and THz absorption experimental results, we have proposed a charging mechanism of QPs. To increase the operating temperature of the QPs, I developed a structure to increase the lateral confinement of electron inside QPs by adding aluminum to the QP growth. Due to the Ga-Al exchange reactions and the morphology of QPs, Al adatoms migrate away from QPs and accumulate around QPs. We verified this Al redistribution using Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and showed that the Al content inside QPs is 3-4 times smaller than the Al content in the matrix QW. We have demonstrated an improvement of the QPs signal and a diminishment of he signal from the matrix QW in the macro-PL, C-V and THz absorption measurements as the Al content is increased to 10%. These experiments prove that the barrier confinement for electrons in the QPs is increased for QP samples with higher Al content at temperatures below 200K. (Abstract shortened by UMI.).",,,
1658,"Severine, Colette, Andree Viollis: Three Women Writers and the Daily Press in Third-Republic France","Une blouse, ""le chapeau,"" ""Le Temps en jupons."" As women journalists of France's Third Republic sought to break out into the public sphere and report the daily news from their own angle, they were regularly greeted by confused bystanders and fellow journalists who wrote them off as nothing more than the articles of clothing that announced their (lesser) sex: blouses, hats, and slips. This often hostile environment, however, failed to discourage several women journalists who reported the daily news from their marginalized perspective: Severine, Colette, and Andree Viollis. The reportages by these three women offer us new perspectives on the everyday stories of their era as well as the critical questions of women's suffrage, war, court trials, and social injustices, and testify to the evolving and comingling genres of literature and journalism. As first-hand witnesses to such scenes, the reporteresses became empathetic readers of social others, of those victims they encountered during the course of their reporting. As a result, when they reported back to their middle-class readership, these women attempted to sensitize their audience to the plight of others, stripping their readers of any existing indifference to social, racial, or gender differences, and turning the readers into secondary witnesses. Through this exclusive position, these women gained access to the public forum and were effectively able to shape their public despite their own limited political rights. Ultimately, through their corporeal attachment to the scene and the writing that resulted from their experiences, these journalists brought a new perspective to the writing and function of the daily news through the use of their own sensations; the mosaic of articles no longer presented a detached reading experience, but instead, the woman reporter offered readers stories that mediated connectedness.",,,
1659,"High-Power, Low-Droop III-Nitrides Based Blue Light-Emitting Diodes","III-Nitrides based light-emitting diodes (LED) have greatly attracted considerable attention due to their use in a range of applications for illumination and are often operated at high drive currents to achieve high emission powers. In order to have enough emission optical powers, LEDs with high internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and light extraction efficiency (LEE) as well as external quantum efficiency (EQE) are required. In this work, first, we explored the optical and material properties of GaN-based polar and semipolar blue LEDs grown on c-plane patterned sapphire substrate (PSS) and free-standing GaN (FS-GaN) substrate, respectively. By analyzing these properties, we were be able to achieve high IQE, LEE, and EQE values using novel designs of the epi structure and LED package. At UCSB, by using a novel vertical transparent ZnO-stand LED (VT-LED) package to reduce the loss of photons in the absorptive materials (p-type GaN, indium-tin oxide, and silver header, etc.), high LEE of 76 and 75% can be achieved for GaN-based LEDs grown on PSS and FS-GaN substrate, respectively. In this study, we also find a close agreement between simulating and experimental results. On the other hand, in order to achieve high IQE and EQE for blue LEDs at high current densities (> 100 A/cm2), low-carrier-density structure design is the key to address efficiency droop (J-droop) and thermal droop (T-droop), in which IQE decreases with increasing the injection current and temperature. A compositionally step-graded (CSG) InGaN quantum barrier (QB) and a single 12-nm-thick quantum well (SQW) structure have been applied in polar (0001) and semipolar (2021) blue LEDs, respectively, to mitigate Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) and Auger recombination, and carrier leakage by lowering the carrier density in the active region of the LED. As a consequence, high EQE of _ 46 and 50% and low thermal droop ratios of _ 16 and 10% (when the temperature is elevated from 20 to 100C) can be achieved for polar (0001) and semipolar (2021) blue LEDs, respectively, at the current density of 100 A/cm2. Also, some material characterizations have been done to investigate material properties of polar (0001) and semipolar (202-1-) GaN-Based LEDs.",,,
1660,High dielectric constant oxides on III-V complementary metal-oxide-semiconductors,"Suitable gate dielectrics are needed for III-V channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). III-V semiconductor surfaces tend to have high interface trap state density (Dit). High quality gate dielectrics require a high dielectric constant, a stable interface, and low Dit. The major challenges are scaling down the dielectric to achieve high capacitance densities, understanding defects at the oxide/semiconductor interface, and developing techniques to passivate Dit at the interface. By using nitrogen plasma pre-treatment passivation technique, MOSCAPs with ALD HfO 2 directly on InGaAs as high-k gate stack, with accumulation capacitance density 2.4 mu F/cm2 (EOT=0.6 nm) and 2.5 x 10 12 cm2 eV-1 midgap Dit have been achieved.",,,
1661,Education Leaders' Decision-Making Processes about Educational Facilities in a University Multiple Stakeholder Environment,"This research is a retrospective case study designed to document and analyze the process of decision-making by educational leaders and stakeholders at a four-year university. For this study, educational leaders and key stakeholders agreed to extensive interviews about the decisions made during the design, construction, and post-occupancy phases of two new major facilities. Design and construction of university buildings represent a significant opportunity to study educational leadership in a complex organization, particularly as it pertains to processes of decision-making. Moreover, from a practical standpoint, such research might be particularly useful for addressing rapidly emerging trends in development and deployment of instructional technologies related to instruction, green building, universal design, and health and safety (Earthman, 2009, Tepfer, 2001, Trefor, 2010). However, only limited research exists regarding such processes. Although these types of decisions may involve technical information, for educational leaders they also involve considerations of such drivers as cost, function, and aesthetics. This study used a retrospective case study as part of an exploratory qualitative research strategy for examining both theoretical and practical aspects of the processes of decision-making that occur in complex educational organizations. Therefore, this study examined a particular occasion for overt and detailed decision processes with respect to multiple stakeholder decision-making concepts and models. Also, a portion of this study aimed to document some practical features of the actual decision-making processes in this particular case. Results of analyses indicate important effects on decision-processes related to specific topics: phase differences between design and construction, organizational factors, and emerging trends in educational facilities. Moreover, interactions among these various factors also emerged that are described and interpreted with regard to both their possible theoretical and practical significance. Keywords: (1) Educational leaders, (2) decision making, (3) higher education organizations, (4) educational facilities.",,,
1662,From Gothicism to Classicism: Transnationalism and the Early Art of Frederic Leighton,"Frederic Leighton is inextricably linked to the ""classical"" movement in late Victorian art. However, long before he was a classicist, Leighton's oeuvre was dominated by subjects from the late medieval/early Renaissance periods. The roots of Leighton's mature classicism are to be found in his so-called ""gothic"" works of this early period [c. 1846 (the date of his enrollment in the Stadelshes Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt, Germany) to 1864 (the date of his election as an Associate of the Royal Academy of Arts in London)], a period wherein he enjoyed a continued and direct exposure to the art of Italy, Germany, and France. A detailed accounting of Leighton's formative years and the profound effect exercised by his experience of the art of continental Europe is lacking. While art historians acknowledge that Leighton's work is much more complex than a simple reading might suggest, they invariably focus on his mature classicizing works. Leighton, however, viewed his works---be they from his ""gothic"" period or his ""classical"" period---as part of one continuum. Modern commentators routinely overlook this fact and divide his career into distinct periods. It is this compartmentalized view that this dissertation seeks to counter. Leighton's art is the product of a unique and highly selective process that would only have been conceivable in the context of his early cosmopolitan artistic experiences. An understanding of the circumstances that led to the formation of his early works elucidates the process whereby he developed a direct, transnational, and ultimately modern formulation of classicism centered on formal concerns. This dissertation examines Leighton's early career in the context of (1) his encounter with the art of the early Italian Renaissance and the art and artists of the German Nazarene movement; (2) the reception of his early works in Europe and America; (3) his encounter with French neoclassicism; and (4) its implications for his mature classicism.",,,
1663,Three Essays on Labor Economics,"This dissertation consists of three separate chapters on topics in labor economics. The first chapter, entitled ""Ignorance and Bliss: Early Onset Depression, Human Capital Accumulation and Labor Market Outcomes in Early Adulthood,"" examines the link between early onset mood disorders and post-secondary education and labor market outcomes. In addition, controlling for contemporaneous depression symptoms provides insight into the mechanisms by which adolescent depression affects long-term outcomes. The results of this analysis indicate that the negative long-term outcomes associated with early onset depression symptoms are significant, and result from both the initial depressive episode as well as recurrent symptoms experienced later in life. The second chapter, entitled ""Student Responses to Changes in the Cost of Post-Secondary Education,"" focuses primarily on the effect of changes in tuition and financial aid on education and labor market choices of post-secondary students. The existing literature dealing with the cost of education focuses primarily on education outcomes. I develop a theoretical model to illustrate trade-offs between formal human capital accumulation and labor market participation, which yields predictions about how college cost affects student employment decisions. My empirical analysis is problematic for several reasons, and I do not find evidence to support the predictions of my theoretical model. Despite the lack of empirical evidence, the theoretical model presented here may be a useful starting point for future researchers. The third chapter, entitled ""The Impact of Divorce Law Changes on Fertility Decisions,"" examines the relationship between fertility and unilateral and no-fault divorce laws. The results provide evidence that unilateral divorce laws may have decreased birthrates. Further, we analyze the effect unilateral and no-fault divorce laws have on the birth rate among women with different demographic characteristics such as age, marital status, and level of education. We find that unilateral divorce laws result in a decrease in birthrates among married women. Additionally, there are distributional effects of no-fault divorce laws across age groups, with a significant positive effect on the birthrate among women aged 15 to 29.",,,
1664,Heresy and Religious Life in Fourteenth Century Piedmont,"This dissertation is a case study in medieval religious life. Using a remarkable collection of extant sources, including inquisitorial records, episcopal protocols, and castellan's rolls, I examine an exciting period in the religious history of Chieri, a town located near Turin in the Italian Piedmont, between the mid-1360s and 1412. These decades saw the rise and fall of a non-Catholic movement whose participants rejected almost every doctrine of the Catholic Church and believed that the devil ruled the world. More than one hundred people participated in the movement, and it received the attention of at least three inquisitors. Seventeen people (fifteen of them already dead) were condemned and burned. During that time period, there were also some key developments within the local Catholic Church. In 1383, twelve laymen founded the town's largest hospital, named in honor of the Virgin Mary, and the speedy participation of many donors ensured that the hospital became almost a public work of piety. In 1399, a large number of Chieri's people turned out for an extraordinary procession, crying ""Mercy"" as they marched to the all the town's churches. Finally, in 1405, under the leadership of the cathedral chapter, the community began a major reconstruction of the Duomo, the town's most important church. I argue that these key developments in the local Catholic Church were intimately linked to the story of Chieri's non-Catholic movement. At first, Catholic and non-Catholic religiosity flourished side by side, yet later, when the community renewed its commitment to Catholicism at the turn of the fourteenth century, the non-Catholic movement disappeared. Further, I argue that individuals used Chieri's religious environment to craft distinctive, personal religious experiences.",,,
1665,Investigation of Thermal Stability and Flammability of Polyolefin Composites,"Organoclay-polyolefin nanocomposites are often reported to exhibit slightly increased thermal stability and decreased flammability, compared to unfilled polyolefins. In this thesis, we investigate the properties of nanocomposites containing clay that has not been organically-modified. They are less thermally stable but, unexpectedly, also much less flammable. We investigate the mechanistic origins of these surprising effects. Clay-polyolefin nanocomposites free of surfactants were prepared by in situ polymerization of ethylene or propylene, using a tetrabenzylzirconium catalyst adsorbed onto acid-treated montmorillonite. Their thermal decomposition was investigated qualitatively and quantitatively by anaerobic thermogravimetric analysis, pyrolysis-combustion flow calorimetry and volatiles analysis. The results are compared to those for the unfilled polymers, and for microcomposites prepared by melt-blending. Decreased thermal stability is attributed to clay-catalyzed polymer cracking, which has a lower activation barrier than uncatalyzed thermal depolymerization. Decreased flammability arises in part because the acidic clay also catalyzes the formation of a polyaromatic char from olefins trapped in the solid material by the barrier effect of the dispersed nanofiller. Composites containing either carbon black or fullerenes were prepared and their thermal stability was compared to unfilled polyethylene and clay-polyethylene nanocomposites. Fullerenes were found to be more effective than carbon black, achieving similar increases in aerobic thermal stability at much lower concentrations. Polymer composites were also produced in the presence of layered double hydroxides by in situ polymerization of ethylene in toluene and dimethylformamide. Unlike the acidic clay, layered double hydroxides do not exhibit a detrimental effect on the thermal stability of the polymer.",,,
1666,"Whose Nation Is It Anyway? Performing ""GI American"" Through World War II Soldier Shows","The title of my dissertation refers to the subjective perception of national identity and the military's conscious effort to shape this identity through amateur theatricals performed by and for soldiers. The United States military during World War II structured the intricacies of entertaining 16 million soldiers through Special Services. Amateur theatricals, or soldier shows, were a significant part of this morale program. These World War II entertainments ranged from Irving Berlins' This Is The Army on Broadway to minstrel and variety shows and obscure impromptu drag shows featuring impersonations of Carmen Miranda. This entertainment campaign affected and reflected how these men and women envisioned themselves and their homeland. Yet, there is little existing scholarship about World War II soldier shows, and none analyze amateur theatricals as a body of work or assess soldier shows' significant contribution to American national identity. My dissertation documents this genre and, because of my interdisciplinary approach, bridges a gap between military studies, performance studies, gender studies and theatre history. I argue that the military's ""GI American"" value system lauded individual subjugation to national interests as the foundation of appropriate United States citizenship and the unique participatory nature of the amateur theatricals were the ideal medium to instill these ideals. Utilizing historical evidence obtained through archives around the country including scripts, military and civilian memos, programs, unit histories, interviews, and photographs, I also conducted interviews with soldier show performers and analyzed their personal collections of letters, photographs and memorabilia. Soldier shows portrayed ""GI American"" characteristics which defined a specific embodied vision of a good United States soldier, and by connection---a good United States citizen. A little over 15.5 million soldiers returned home---all of them shaped by the military's morale program. This military influenced vision of themselves and their country had a growing exponential impact on those around them. These men and women of the so called ""Greatest Generation"" have held much political, social and cultural power in our country. Therefore, our contemporary understandings of American identity in terms of gender, race, sexuality, class and ability are intimately connected with soldier theatricals.",,,
1667,Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Silicate Geoliquids,"In order to understand the evolution and current state of the Earth's interior and the interior of other rocky planets, it is essential to understand the thermodynamics, melt structure, and transport properties of liquid silicates that comprise the majority of erupted magmas on Earth and the Earth's interior, namely: forsterite, fayalite, and the 1-bar eutectic composition of the system anorthite-diopside. I used Classical Molecular Dynamics methods to simulate these three systems and extract atomistic measurements that were used to calculate physical properties of these melts at high temperatures and pressures. I found that these techniques can be used to duplicate many laboratory and seismology measurements of the same properties. I also found computational evidence for melt segregation by density as an explanation for the widely held theory that the Mg,Fe/O ratio in the Earth is 2 in the upper mantle and 1 in the lower mantle.",,,
1668,A theoretical and computational study of active and nonlinear microrheology,"Microrheology uses colloidal probes to obtain rheological properties (e.g. viscosity, elasticity or viscoelasticity) of soft materials. The small probe size is advantageous in that it requires small sample volumes, allows incorporation of probes into materials during normal processing, and enables measurement of local properties of heterogeneous samples. Passive microrheology relies on thermal fluctuations to drive probe motion. By its nature, passive microrheology is limited to materials soft enough to respond to thermal forcing, and to only the linear response properties of such materials. Active microrheology circumvents these limitations by applying an external force to drive probe motion. While it is more involved experimentally, it enables one to investigate the rheology of stiffer materials, as well as holds potential to probe nonlinear rheological properties (e.g. shear thinning, yield stress, and normal stress differences). However, the strong forcing drives the material out of equilibrium, and renders the theoretical foundation of passive microrheology invalid. This leaves no clear theoretical path to relate the probe motion in nonlinear microrheology to the nonlinear rheological properties. The work presented in this dissertation seeks to develop a theoretical foundation for active, nonlinear microrheology. We use computational techniques to investigate the relationship between the non-equilibrium microstructure and nonlinear rheological properties of soft materials. We first show that gentle motion of a microrheological probe drives stresses within the bulk material, whose retarding influence on the probe is in quantitative agreement with macroscopic linear shear rheology. Guided by this, we then examine the bulk microstructural stresses established around a strongly forced microrheological probe. In the nonlinear regime of active microrheology, a variety of new features arise -- non-viscometric flows, spatially inhomogeneous strains, and Lagrangian unsteadiness -- that potentially complicate the theoretical interpretation of these stresses and their relation to macroscopic rheological properties. We investigate and quantify each of these possible issues, and propose alternative probe shapes and probe motions to mitigate these effects, and illustrate conditions under which macroscopic rheological properties may be extracted from nonlinear microrheology measurements.",,,
1669,Rock Climbers Defying Gravity and Gender Expectations,"This research seeks to explore a specific way that bodies may be redefined as feminine and strong. Much of the literature on gender analyzes the ways in which individuals are confined by gender expectations. Climbing is a venue that celebrates skills traditionally associated with femininity such as flexibility, but because it is assumed to require a lot of upper-body strength, it is not sport typed as feminine. This creates an ideal environment to combine qualities traditionally associated with both femininity and masculinity, and as individuals excel in climbing they discipline their bodies to cultivate both sets of characteristics. Developing both embodied masculine and feminine traits may blur embodied gender traits, and place less emphasis on binary categorizations. This is why climbing offers important opportunities to redefine our knowing bodies with respect to our gender. This research is based on thirty semi-structured interviews coded to produce grounded theory. I also conducted content analysis on thirty-eight issues of two popular climbing magazines, and utilized two years of participant observation to generate the theoretical analysis. The media analysis revealed less emphasis on normative femininity than other types of media, but women are still not represented equally in numbers of photographs, the number of female authors published, or the difficulty of the climbs. The women I interviewed described feeling both physically and socially stronger in their everyday lives, and also more empowered suggesting that climbing has a spill-over effect whereby women come to see themselves as more capable in their everyday lives. Ultimately, I suggest that activities such as rock climbing which allow women to develop holistic, strong, synchronized bodies helps them resist the dominant cultural messages associated with fragmented and weak femininity.",,,
1670,The Bears: Exploring the Alternative Sexual Aesthetics of a Gay Male Subculture,"In this dissertation, I examine the ways in which gender, appearance, and erotics are enacted, constructed, and negotiated by a gay male sexual subculture called bears, using participant observation, interviews and textual analysis through the tenets of grounded theory. The word ""bear"" is an umbrella term that can describe physical traits to refer to attitudes that are shared by this group. The formation of the bear identity has provided an alternative to what many agree is the hegemonic gay male identity in the United States. Individual bears may see it as a community, a subculture, or a social movement. I compare two social clubs for bears and analyze how they created supportive alternative sexual spaces for anyone who was interested. Through participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and textual analysis I explore issues of identity, gender, appearance, and sexual aesthetics.",,,
1671,Defending Against Malicious Software,"Contemporary malicious software is crafted and deployed by sophisticated and highly organized criminal enterprises. Modern threats include advanced spyware and large-scale botnets that are designed to profit from the vulnerabilities that are inherent in the well-connected, Internet-enabled computing ecosystem. Furthermore, nation-states have begun leveraging malware in targeted attacks against their enemies to steal state secrets or even damage physical infrastructure. A considerable security community has formed to combat the ever-evolving malware threat, inspiring an arms race between attackers and defenders. To wit, malware authors continue to improve their techniques for the delivery and concealment of malicious payloads. Meanwhile, researchers have enhanced their approaches to defense, which can be generally divided into three stages: analysis, detection, and response. While valuable work has been done in each of these areas, malware, unfortunately, still flourishes. In this dissertation, we take a holistic approach to improving malware defense by making novel contributions to all three of the aforementioned stages. In particular, we discuss our analysis of the Torpig botnet, in which we obtained unique insights into the operations of the malicious network by taking control of it for a period of ten days. Our analysis demonstrates how sophisticated and destructive contemporary malware has become. This motivated our development of two host-based systems to detect and contain such malware. The first approach detects malware by implementing a dynamic code identity primitive. The second system contains malware by blocking malicious attempts to interact with trusted processes to carry out hostile actions. Collectively, these systems offer an effective and complementary approach to mitigating the threat of advanced malware.",,,
1672,Female College Athlete Leadership and Team Effectiveness,"This exploratory study contributes to the research on athlete leadership and team effectiveness in college sports. Athletic departments and sports coaches could benefit from a study about athlete leadership and team effectiveness in order to assist their student-leaders with leadership development and explore additional means to help improve team effectiveness. Three women's fall sports teams (cross country, soccer, and volleyball) at one university participated in this study. Two primary research groups provided the qualitative data: (a) athlete leaders (n=7) shared their experiences in interviews, and (b) team members (n=40) completed questionnaires. The first purpose of the study was to examine the perceptions of athlete leaders about the leadership role (including their responsibilities and definitions for an effective athlete leader) and its possible connection with team effectiveness. The second purpose was to study the perceptions of team members about the leadership role (including leader responsibilities and traits a team leader should possess) and its possible connection with team effectiveness. The two groups of participants concurred that being a good example was of highest importance; however, the definition for 'good example' was inconsistent between participants. Both groups also credited unified team goals and team chemistry as the main conditions that create a top performing team. The third purpose was to fit the findings from the athlete leaders and team members into the context of Hackman and Oldham's (1980) model of how athlete leadership could influence team effectiveness. For the purposes of this study, the most pertinent aspect of their model on teams addresses a major influence on organizational productivity: the relationship between people and the tasks that they must perform. The findings from the study generated more questions related to the athlete leadership role and team effectiveness, specifically: (a) how do athlete leaders and team members define 'being a good example'? And (b) how do athlete leaders and team members define 'having good team chemistry'?",,,
1673,The acquisition of social status by males in small-scale human societies (with an emphasis on the Tsimane of Bolivia),"Male status hierarchies are a human universal. In all societies, men with a greater ability to inflict costs (i.e. dominance) or confer benefits (i.e. prestige) gain differential access to contested resources. However, our knowledge of how human societies compare in the determinants and outcomes of status is limited. Ethnographies are typically anecdotal; they explore the link between only one particular trait and social status, or lack a longitudinal design to assess causal relationships. Filling this knowledge gap in fast-disappearing small-scale societies is critical, given their relevance to understanding human evolution and transitions in socio-political complexity over human history. Among the Tsimane horticulturalists of Bolivia, I find that there is a high level of inequality in status acquisition across men, even though they lack formal, authoritative government. The consensus-based decision-making in small-scale societies does not preclude significant inter-individual power differentials beyond those due to age and sex. I compare status acquisition in different domains (dyadic fighting ability, getting one's way in groups, community-wide influence, and respect from peers), which differ in the extent to which they reflect dominance versus prestige. Physical size best predicts fighting ability while social support from allies, both kin and non-kin, best predicts success in the other status domains. Market-related skills are growing contributors to community-wide influence, which is more unequally distributed in more modernized Tsimane villages. Greater access to private, material wealth in these more modernized villages does not undercut the sharing of food and labor across households, which are important means of securing allies and, ultimately, influence. I also evaluate the reproductive outcomes of status acquisition. I find that more influential Tsimane men have more surviving offspring within their marital unions, due to marrying young wives and to the support of allies, but they also experience more extra-marital affairs. The strong relationship between status and fertility (both legitimate and illegitimate) across small-scale societies suggests men do not pursue status solely to improve their access to mates but also to benefit their families. This dissertation is the first multivariate analysis of social status to consider different determinants or outcomes of status simultaneously and is also the first to present longitudinal data on status acquisition in a small-scale society.",,,
1674,Turkish Immigrant Children's Code-Switching Practices: Constructing Language Ideologies and Identities in Interaction,"Language ideologies ""envision and enact ties of language to identity, to aesthetics, to morality, and to epistemology"" (Woolard, 1998, p.3). They are socialized through everyday community language practices and social-interaction routines (Ochs, 1996; Schieffelin, 2003). This study follows the everyday interactions of a peer group of second generation Turkish and Meskhetian Turkish immigrant children in two Arizona settings; an elementary school, and a Turkish Saturday (heritage language) School, to examine how the children negotiate ideologies and identities in interaction with peers. ""The role of children in socializing children is particularly critical for understanding how identities are negotiated in the increasingly multicultural and multilingual post-colonial and transnational societies where children grow up today"" (Goodwin and Kyratzis, 2007, p. 281). The study combines methods of ethnography with talk-in-interaction. Children were followed in naturally occurring peer interactions over one year, and were interviewed in groups about using Turkish and English. The elementary school and Turkish Saturday School adhered to an English-only ideology and Turkish-only ideology, respectively. The Turkish-English bilingual/multilingual children of this study used mostly English in their peer group interactions at both sites. The children created domain-associations (Fader, 2001; Garrett, 2005; Paugh, 2005; Schieffelin, 2003) for Turkish and English through their language practices (e.g., Turkish for adult voicing and religious messages; English for peer talk). They also code-switched between Turkish and English to accomplish a variety of conversational purposes, including shifting to a new ""frame"" (Auer, 1998; Ervin-Tripp & Reyes, 2005; Goffman, 1974, 1981; Gumperz & Cook-Gumperz, 2005; Kyratzis, Tang & Koymen, 2009; Zentella, 1997) or kind of talk other than the on-going school task, where could ask questions of and help one another or make commentary. By using fluid bilingual language practices, children affirmed a bilingual peer group identity (Bailey, 2007b; Jorgensen, 1998; Keim, 2008; Kyratzis, 2010; Kyratzis, Reynolds and Evaldsson, 2010; Shankar, 2008; Zentella, 1997). Children's language practices in ways reproduced, yet also challenged, monolingual language ideologies of the dominant US society and elementary school, as well as of the Turkish Saturday School.",,,
1675,Media Epidemics: Viral Structures in Literature and New Media,"Media Epidemics is an interdisciplinary project in literary, cultural, film, and media studies (including digital media studies) that explores the structure of ""viral media."". In the 1980s and early 1990s, as western societies moved into a post-communist, post-atomic social condition, several factors developed in parallel in relation to viruses. 1983 marked both the discovery of the HIV virus and the first time that the term ""virus"" was used to describe a self-replicating computer program. At the same time that social awareness of HIV was spreading, the personal computer became more user friendly and was installed in an increasing number of middle-class homes. Thus, developing along separate trajectories, social awareness of biological viruses and social awareness of computer viruses were on the rise. It was not until the mid-1990s however, with the advent of what is now commonly referred to as ""network society"", that the stage was finally set for the proliferation of what my dissertation terms ""viral structures."" Viral structures are located within media ecologies that may include both representational media (texts such as literature, film, etc. that ""represent"" the viral within their content) and operational media (media and technology, such as software and websites, that circulate in our media ecology). Thus, a viral structure can be any text/technology/etc. that represents or relies upon a paradigm of infectiousness, i.e. operation outside of control structures, obscured transmission, and an engagement in production and reproduction via unconventional means. Viral structures are one of the ways in which networked subjects negotiate power and subjectivity within the flickering presence of emerging knowledge spaces. Media Epidemics studies viral media structures by focusing closely and also in context on such representational and operational works as William Gibson's novel Pattern Recognition, the 2010 ""iamamiwhoami"" YouTube video series, Koji Suzuki's novel Ring, the global release patterns of the original texts and adaptations of the Ring multimedia franchise, and a variety of video-based viral structures. The dissertation also includes unique visual and digital/interactive supplements for each chapter that extend the argument.",,,
1676,Ecosystem Services and Cost-Effective Conservation Planning,"I address three aspects of conservation planning and environmental management, introducing new information and quantitative methods for better conservation decision-making. In chapter 1, I model the ecosystem service of recreation in Puget Sound, WA, to understand the spatial heterogeneity in recreational usage, and determine how water quality variation affects visitation. Visitation model results illustrate how visitation relates to various amenities and costs. In a fixed effects analysis, visitation was negatively related to water quality while controlling for seasonal trends and time-variant factors. This indicates people are responding to changes in water quality, and an improvement would yield an increase in the value of recreation. The results are useful for the prioritization of water quality improvement and other natural resource management projects. In chapter 2 I compare optimal to heuristic selection algorithms in a utility maximization problem. I also quantify the efficiency of the algorithm when site availability is a stochastic process reflective of land use change. I show the optimal IP formulation outperforms the greedy heuristic by 8%. When site availability is a stochastic process with fewer available parcels, the IP solution is again higher than the greedy, and the accumulated utility is 70% - 88% of the full IP solution. This study is unique in its use of integer programming in a multicriteria utility maximization approach, and has many potential applications in conservation planning and natural resource management. In chapter 3, I model conservation easement costs to determine how easement value affects conservation priorities. Cost information improves conservation efficiency and effectiveness, yet is not often considered. Similarly, conservation easements are frequently used by conservation organizations, but rarely in large scale planning. I model easements using spatial hedonic models with observed transactions and agricultural assessment data. I then prioritize conservation actions with each data set, and find differences in priorities. Since development rights and agricultural value can be quite different at a given site, easements are not a simple fraction of total value, justifying the extra modeling steps. If the full cost is used in planning instead of easement value, priorities may be incorrect or inefficient at meeting conservation targets.",,,
1677,Remote sensing of forest dynamics and land use in Amazonia,"The rich, vast Amazonian ecosystem is directly and indirectly threatened by human activities; remote sensing serves as an essential tool for monitoring, understanding and mitigating these threats. A multi-faceted body of work is described here, addressing three major issues that employ and advance remote sensing techniques for the study of Amazonia and other tropical rainforest regions. In Chapter 2, canopy reflectance modeling and satellite observations were used to quantify the effect of epiphylls on remote sensing of humid forests. Modeling simulations demonstrated sensitivity of canopy-level near infrared and green reflectance to epiphylls on leaves. Time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data corroborated the modeling results, suggesting a degree of coupling between epiphyll cover and vegetation indices which must be accounted for when using optical remote sensing in humid forests. In Chapter 4, 11 years (2000--2010) of MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data covering the entire Amazon basin were used to ascertain the role of heat stress during droughts in 2005 and 2010. Preliminary accuracy assessments showed that LST data provided reasonably accurate estimates of daytime air temperatures (RMSE = 1.45C; Chapter 3). There were moderate to strong correlations between LST-based air temperature estimates and tower measurements (mean r = 0.64), illustrating a sensitivity to temporal variability. During both droughts, MODIS LST data detected anomalously high daytime and nighttime canopy temperatures throughout drought-affected regions. Multivariate linear models of LST and precipitation anomalies explained 65.1% of the variability in forest biomass losses, as determined from a wide network of forest inventory plots. These results suggest that models should incorporate both heat and moisture to predict drought effects on tropical forests. In Chapter 5, I performed high spatial and temporal resolution modeling of carbon stocks and fluxes in the state of Rondonia, Brazil for the period 1985--2009. Based on this analysis, Rondonia contributed _4% of pan-tropical humid forest deforestation emissions while carbon uptake by secondary forest was negligible due to limited spatial extent and high turnover rates. Spatial analysis of land cover change demonstrated the necessity for fine resolution carbon monitoring in tropical regions dominated by non-mechanized, smallholder land uses.",,,
1678,Imaging and controlling spins in semiconductors and ferromagnets,"Spins possess robust coherent and exchange-driven properties in semiconductors and ferromagnets. In this work, we investigate three experiments that incorporate and exploit these spin properties to demonstrate innovated quantum information processing, magnetic detection and control techniques. In the first experiment we spatially confine an effective magnetic field to control the coherent state of moving electron spins. Optically-injected electron spin ensembles are transported through a gate-controlled, spatially-isolated region with a large effective magnetic field created by locally polarized nuclear spins within a GaAs channel at T = 8 K. By tuning the localized effective field strength and drift velocity we detect, using time-resolved Kerr rotation (TRKR), induced spin rotations of up to 5pi radians in 6 ns over a 30 mum distance. In the second experiment, we develop a sensitive electrical technique derived from the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) to measure domain wall (DW) motion with nanometer precision. We then use this system to study the elastic properties of single ferromagnetic DWs in (Ga,Mn)As. Full understanding of the electrical signal is only possible after accurately determining the DW location with respect to the electrical contacts. Therefore, we image the DWs using a custom-built, diffraction-limited video magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy system while simultaneously measuring the AHE. By combining these detection schemes we are able to precisely measure temperature-dependent elastic DW dynamics and kinetics below TC. Finally, the third experiment relates our progress toward understanding the coupling between the multiferroic oxide BiFeO3 (BFO) and a CoFe magnetic layer. The exchange-bias mediated coupling between ferroelectric domains of the BFO and ferromagnetic domains in the CoFe layer suggest a pathway to realize electrical control of the magnetization properties. We investigate and model the ferroelectric influence on magnetocrystalline anisotropies in the CoFe thin film by measuring the static and dynamical magnetic properties using anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and transport-based ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements.",,,
1679,Two-Year College Mathematics Instructors' Conceptions of Variation,"Statistics education researchers are urging teachers of statistics to help students develop a more sophisticated understanding of variation, since variation is the core of statistics. However, little research has been done into the conceptions of variation held by instructors of statistics. This is of particular importance at the community college level because there was a 60% increase in enrollment in introductory statistics courses in a recent five-year period. Moreover, at the community college level only 2% of full-time instructors and 2% of part-time instructors have a degree in statistics. This exploratory study was designed to map the conceptions of variation held by two-year college mathematics instructors. A total of 52 instructors from 33 different California community colleges responded to a survey designed to reveal instructors' conception of variation. All of the instructors had a degree in mathematics---seven of them also had a degree in statistics. Instructors had varied statistics teaching experience: 23 of them had never taught statistics and 29 had taught statistics often. The results of the study indicated that there was a difference in the type of responses; however, their educational background or their statistics teaching experience did not highlight the difference. The results indicate that some instructors readily acknowledge variability and others do not. A tendency to focus only on the center of the distribution seemed to prevail, and very few instructors gave explanations integrating different aspects of the distribution. The majority focused on the center or on the range. Another salient characteristic of the results of this study was instructors' lack of consideration for context when making decisions about variability in the data. Moreover, this study revealed that instructors were not consistent throughout the survey items. In some cases, instructors predicted variability, but their justifications lacked the appropriate reasoning to support their predictions. This study has opened the gate and laid the groundwork for understanding conceptions of variation held by two-year college instructors. The results indicate that more in-depth investigation needs to take place if the goal is for students to develop a sophisticated conception of variation.",,,
1680,"Franz Liszt's ""Harmonies poetiques et religieuses"": The inspiration derived from the poetry of Alphonse de Lamartine, with an analysis of the 1853 piano cycle","A thorough understanding of Liszt's piano cycle, Harmonies poetiques et religieuses, requires a cross-section of research on Liszt, Lamartine, and the connections between music and literature in the nineteenth century. Many scholars have discussed the influence upon Liszt of poets such as Goethe, Schiller, and Dante. There is, however, scant information regarding the inspiration derived from Lamartine, despite the fact that two of Liszt's most grandiose compositions, Les Preludes and Harmonies poetiques et religieuses, are inspired by Lamartine's work. There are numerous French biographies on Lamartine, but only three in English; these are by William Fortescue, Charles Lombard, and Henry Remsen Whitehouse. Regarding theoretical analyses of Liszt's Harmonies, Joan Backus, Albert Brussee, Serge Gut, and Adrienne Kaczmarczyk have written thorough analyses of specific movements, but there is no extant analysis of the cycle as a whole. This study aims to provide the relevant background information and analysis necessary for the pianist approaching Liszt's Harmonies poetiques et religieuses. Chapter 1 summarizes Liszt's vision of the ""program,"" the his use of extra-musical references in many of his compositions. Chapter 2 discusses the composer's incorporation of literature and, specifically, the ways in which poetry exercised a profound role in his compositions. Chapter 3 provides biographical information on Lamartine, highlighting the Romantic ideals he shared with Liszt. In Chapter 4, an overview of Lamartine's Harmonies poetiques et religieuses examines the prevailing thematic material, as well as the reception of this work in the salons of the 1830s. Chapter 5 provides a similar examination of Liszt's Harmonies poetiques et religieuses. In particular, the long gestation of the work, and its various versions and specific ties to Lamartine's poetry, is addressed. Chapter 6 is analytical in nature, and is divided into three sections. The first section researches those movements directly linked with Lamartine's poems; the second section discusses the pieces in the cycle that are freer adaptations of the poetry; finally, the third section offers an overview of the pieces that Liszt added to Harmonies much later, which have no specific correlation to Lamartine, but perhaps add to the musical weight and structure of the work.",,,
1681,Accurate Characterization of Stochastic Rare Events in Biochemical Systems,"A common approach for studying stochastic biochemical behavior utilizes the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). For rare events, characterization with the SSA is not feasible, as the number of realizations needed to witness even a single rare event is very large. To address this limitation, Kuwahara and Mura developed the weighted SSA (wSSA), which uses importance sampling (IS) to bias the system of interest toward the rare event. Although the wSSA can be more efficient than the SSA, its performance is highly sensitive to the choice of biasing parameters, which are problem-dependent constants that are chosen by insight and numerical experiment. Also, the wSSA lacks a measure of accuracy for its estimates. We first describe procedural extensions to the wSSA, which provide an unambiguous measure of the optimality of a given set of IS parameters. We then develop the state-dependent wSSA (swSSA), which employs state-dependent IS parameters to efficiently characterize rare events in systems with highly variable states. Next, we introduce the doubly weighted SSA (dwSSA). Unlike the wSSA and the swSSA, the dwSSA provides an automated mechanism for learning constant IS parameters that yield a low-variance estimate. Lastly, we describe an extension to the dwSSA---the state-dependent dwSSA (sdwSSA)---that employs state-dependent IS parameters. The sdwSSA efficiently and automatically computes these parameters by dynamically discretizing the relative propensity ranges during a multilevel cross-entropy simulation. All algorithms presented are applied to systems of varying size and complexity, to gauge their efficiency as well as accuracy. In addition to the results described here, we provide the dwSSA and the sdwSSA as freely available software packages that are applicable to any systems that can be written in the mass action formulation of chemical kinetics.",,,
1682,"Identifying Individual, Family, and Education Factors that Protect Latina Adolescents in Alternative High Schools from an Early Pregnancy","Little is known about what factors shape the reproductive health outcomes of Latina girls in high risk settings such as alternative high schools. This question is important because these adolescents are at-risk for school dropout and are in an environment in which risky sexual behavior and adolescent parenting is normative. Although such factors contribute to their vulnerability to teenage pregnancy, many sexually active adolescents in alternative schools are resilient to these influences. Under the asset framework (Benson, 2003; Lerner, 2005), protective factors are conditions that buffer exposure to risks. Additionally, a compensatory model of resilience suggests having enough protective factors can offset or counteract the negative effects of risk or adversity, or improve positive adjustment in general (Masten & Wright, 2009).This study identifies protective factors that contribute to low-achieving sexually active never pregnant (NP) Latina adolescents' resilience toward an early pregnancy by comparing them to a sample of pregnant/parenting (PP) adolescents. The participants were fifty-five NP adolescents (16--18 years) enrolled in alternative schools and 36 same-age PP adolescents from the same community. The NP adolescents reported lower levels of academic achievement and lower feelings of school belonging at the onset of high school. The 40-minute survey was similar for both groups with the exception that for PP adolescents, attitudinal and communication questions were preceded with the phrase ""before you became pregnant...?"" A series of MANCOVAs were performed. There was a significant difference between NP and PP adolescents on positive orientation toward early motherhood (F (1, 87) = 13.80, p < .001, with NP adolescents perceiving the role of adolescent motherhood less positively than PP adolescents. NP adolescents reported greater condom use self-efficacy compared to PP adolescents, after controlling for age ( F (1, 84) = 6.66, p < .01. Maternal communication variables and educational goals were not significantly different between the groups. Although the sexually active NP adolescents were at high risk for pregnancy because of their low academic achievement and low levels of school belonging at the onset of high school, having less positive orientation toward motherhood and confidence using condoms seemed to protect them from an early pregnancy.",,,
1683,Fracture mechanical and statistical properties of avalanches that fail on nonpersistent snow crystals,"Nonpersistent snow crystals are deposited during storms, last for a few days, and are common fracture planes in avalanches. Because avalanches on persistent crystals cause more deaths, avalanches on nonpersistent crystals receive less study despite being responsible for the majority of avalanche fatalities in some U.S. states such as California. Avalanches are studied here using thousands of avalanche control records, dozens of crown face profiles, and field work with near-infrared (nIR) imaging and particle tracking. New (24-hr) snow and Extended Column Test propagation (ECTP) are the best predictors of avalanche activity on nonpersistent crystals, while changes in temperature and density during storms have no effect. Failure planes with nonpersistent crystals are the same hardness as layers immediately above, but are significantly softer than layers immediately below. In one nIR profile, nonpersistent crystals form a thin weak layer, but in others, there is no grain size difference between the fracture plane and adjacent strata. Lack of a weak layer makes fracture in nonpersistent crystals similar to other materials; fractures cut through the bulk without any specific weakness other than a flaw. Failures in nonpersistent crystals follow behavior predicted by the anticrack model, a model emphasizing collapse that has only been tested on failures of persistent crystals. This suggests nonpersistent and persistent crystals share the same failure mechanism. Critical cut lengths during Propagation Saw Tests (PSTs) vary little with slope angle, consistent with anticrack predictions. A PST on nonpersistent crystals collapsed about 1 mm, half the collapse of a PST on persistent crystals. Easily collapsible planar crystals such as sectored plates and stellars are the most common nonpersistent crystals in failure planes. During high instability, fractures are easier to trigger on nonpersistent than on persistent crystals. Sustainability of propagation depends on new snow depth because the slab must withstand bending; otherwise tensile slab fracture occurs. Measurement of displacement during PSTs yield some of the lowest elastic moduli recorded for snow: 0.04-0.41 MPa for slabs with densities from 73-143 kg m-3. The median fracture energy for nonpersistent crystals is 0.09 J m-2, comparable to published values for persistent crystals.",,,
1684,Semimetallic Nanorods Embedded in High-Index Semiconductors,"The first reported work on nanowire growth occurred decades ago and has now been successfully reported for a wide range of both metallic and semiconducting materials. However, the vast majority of these growths produced free-standing structures. This dissertation investigates the novel growth and resulting properties of embedded RE-V semimetallic nanorods in III-V semiconductors grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Semimetal/semiconductor composite materials of ErAs and ErSb nanorods were grown by codeposition with GaAs and GaSb on high-index GaAs and GaSb substrates. Their structural, optical, and electrical properties were found to be dependent on the resulting microstructure and the growth conditions used. An investigation of the microstructure of each growth was performed using both cross-sectional and plan-view transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy in order to determine the size, shape, structure, and orientation of the embedded nanostructures. The size, shape, and periodicity of these structures were found to be dependent on the growth temperature and, to a lesser degree, on the RE concentration used. The orientation of the nanorods was found to be dependent on the orientation of the underlying substrate. Additional investigation into the morphology of codeposited TbAs and ErAs nanoparticles in InGaAs was also performed. Optical absorption spectroscopy indicated a large, polarization-dependent resonant absorption peak in these nanostructures that was attributed to plasmon oscillations similar to those observed in metallic nanostructures. These peaks were found to be dependent on the surrounding matrix material as well as the size and shape of the nanostructures, consistent with theory. The plasmon absorption peak hinted at the semimetallic electronic structure of the underlying nanostructures, which was confirmed using scanning tunneling spectroscopy.",,,
1685,Impact of Policy on Interaction between Land Use and Road Networks and Its Change over Time,"This study investigates the impact of policy on interaction between land use and road network changes over time within cities. Policy, in this study, has been defined as the combination of the regional level government programs and political history which affects the pattern of urbanization in a region. The study focuses on urbanization in a politically volatile region that juxtaposes two completely different interaction regimes in a single city and explores the dynamics of the road network as determined by land use change. Land use change studies usually compare the landscape across different time periods and investigate the transitions and proportions of change among land use classes. Yet intensification and enhancement of the underlying road network directly influences the land use in terms of type and location. In particular, the aim of the study is to demonstrate how land use maps can be integrated in time and space, and across an international boundary (Italy/Slovenia) to better integrate policy differences into urban systems models in general and cellular automata models. While urban dynamics have been extensively researched and simulated, the development of the road network is usually exogenous to the modeling or is ignored entirely. The primary analysis is been conducted using maps and imagery of the adjacent cities of Gorizia, Italy and Nova Gorica, Slovenia, twin towns historically divided by a political border, a line that has changed in its degree of separation from extreme during the Cold War, to minimal today. To link the findings with modeling, the SLEUTH model has been adapted to simulate the policy impacts on urbanization, allowing experimentation with incorporating policy into cellular automata models. Further, multiple network analysis indices and measures of spatial association are used to understand the relationship between change in land use and road networks. The study was able to successfully demonstrate impact of policy on urbanization and the results show that policy influences the land use change and road networks individually but it doesn't impact their relationship. The study improves our ability to estimate the local, regional and global impacts of future (and past) land use changes on the natural and built environments. If global change is to be managed for humankind's benefit, then control and knowledge of land use change will be paramount. Simulation of policy impacts via computer modeling and visualization, and using the forecasts within decision and planning support systems, are precious for creating a sustainable future.",,,
1686,Coaching in Special Education: Toward a Model of Differentiated Professional Development for Elementary School Paraeducators,"Although there is a considerable amount of research studies about effective professional development, a literature review revealed that educators are not receiving effective professional development in order to improve instruction. What is paramount in the studies of professional development is that the traditional one-shot model does not meet the needs of all educators. This study aims to consider differentiated (targeted) professional development as it examines the correlation between the training followed by the coaching of paraeducators, trained in applied behavioral analysis (ABA) in one district. One model suggests that differentiated professional development through coaching and utilizing videotaping provides effective implementation of applied behavioral analysis. The research questions are: How might coaching contribute to the effective implementation of ABA strategies within special education? What components of coaching are most effective for paraeducators, in implementing the ABA research-based methodology in special education? The goal of the study was to determine if the paraeducators decreased their prompting intensity, while increasing the rate of reinforcement. The lessening of the prompting while increasing the reinforcement is a more complex element of ABA. Through the coaching and videotaping, the paraeducators learned specific techniques using prompting and reinforcement. After the coach provided the basic ABA training, four paraeducators began implementing prompting and reinforcement while the researcher observed, collected data, and videotaped the performances. The coach and the paraeducators debriefed and reviewed the videotape, and the coach provided guided coaching within this series of professional development days. Findings attained through documentation analyses, observations, and surveys were examined. The rate of reinforcement increased while the lessening of prompting decreased. Although the goal was obtained in general, future questions developed. Two questions are: did the paraeducators improve because there was a greater awareness of the prompting and reinforcement provided, or was the professional development provided in a model that allowed for effective responses to the intervention? The paraeducators provided survey feedback expressing that the use of coaching paired with videotaping was an effective component of professional development and met the differentiated and individualized needs of each paraeducator. The study ends with suggestions for further research and implications for practice.",,,
1687,Multi-Gigabit Reception with Time-interleaved Analog-to-Digital Converters,"Moore's law drives the economies of scale in modern communication systems, with most receiver functionalities being implemented in digital signal processing (DSP) after analog to digital conversion. Extending the computational advantage provided by Moore's law to multi-Gigabit communication systems requires analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with high sampling rate and output resolution. A promising approach to realize such ADCs at reasonable power consumption is to employ a time- interleaved (TI) architecture with slower (but power-efficient) sub-ADCs in parallel. However, mismatch among the sub-ADCs, if left uncompensated, can cause error floors in receiver performance. Traditionally, mismatch is compensated either by employing larger transistors, by analog adjustments, or by dedicated digital mismatch compensation whose complexity increases with the desired resolution at the output of the TI-ADC. In this thesis, we investigate a novel approach, in which mismatch and channel dispersion are compensated jointly, with the performance metric being overall link reliability rather than ADC performance. We first characterize the structure of mismatch-induced interference for an OFDM system, and demonstrate the efficacy of a frequency-domain interference suppression scheme whose complexity is independent of constellation size (which determines the desired resolution). Numerical results from computer simulation and from experiments on a hardware prototype show that the performance with the proposed joint mismatch and channel compensation technique is close to that without mismatch. Next, we explore time-domain mismatch compensation approaches that scale with the number of sub-ADCs and the desired resolution. We show that low-complexity linear mismatch compensation is possible if we employ oversampling. We establish a strong analogy between the role of oversampling for mismatch compensation and for channel equalization, even though the structure of the interference due to mismatch is different from that due to a dispersive channel. While the proposed compensation architectures work with offline estimates of mismatch parameters, we provide an iterative, online method for joint estimation of mismatch and channel parameters which leverages the training overhead already available in communication signals. We provide a closed form solution for each iteration, for both channel and mismatch estimates, based on a linear approximation for the nonlinear effect of timing mismatch. We investigate the scalability and convergence of this joint estimation algorithm, and derive rules of thumb relating the required length of pseudorandom training to the number of sub-ADCs. Further, we design periodic training sequences with significantly enhanced convergence rates.",,,
1688,Monolithically Integrated Reconfigurable Filters for Microwave Photonic Links,"For the purposes of commercial communication and military electronic warfare and radar alike, there is an increasing interest in RF systems that can handle very wide instantaneous bandwidths at high center frequencies. Optical signal processing has the capability to reduce latency, improve size, weight and power (SwAP) performance, and overcome the inherent bandwidth limitations of electronic counterparts. By rapidly pre-filtering wide bandwidth microwave signals in the optical domain, the analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) and subsequent digital signal processing (DSP) can be significantly relieved. Compared to channelizing and add/drop filters for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) applications, the microwave filter application is much more challenging as it requires a more versatile filter, ideally with tunability in both frequency and bandwidth. In this work such a filter was developed using integrated photonics. By integrating the filter on a single InP chip, the stability required for coherent filtering is met, while the active integration platform offers a flexible filter design and higher tolerance in the coupler and fabrication specifications. Using an entirely deep etched fabrication with a single blanket regrowth, a simple fabrication with high yield is achieved. The reconfigurable filter is designed as an array of uncoupled filter stages with each filter stage reconfigurable as a filter pole or zero with arbitrary magnitude and phase. This gives rise to a flexible ffilter synthesis, much like an optical version of DSP filters. Flat-topped bandpass filters are demonstrated with frequency tunability over 30 GHz, bandwidth adjustable between 1.9 and 5.4 GHz, and stopband rejection >32 dB. In order to meet the stringent spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) requirements of the microwave application, a novel epitaxial layer integration platform is developed. Optimized for high optical saturation power and low propagation loss, it produces semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) with low distortion and noise. Utilizing a novel characterization method of RF signal distortion for photonic devices, SOAs with state-of-the art SFDR in the range of 115 dB--Hz2/3 and a noise figure of 3.8 dB for 6 dB gain, is demonstrated. It is projected that this platform could ultimately provide integration for photonic microwave filter applications.",,,
1689,Design strategies for peptide amphiphile micelles,"Peptide amphiphiles (PAs) are capable of self-assembly into micelles which can be used in the targeted delivery of peptide therapeutics and diagnostics. PA micelles exhibit a structural resemblance to proteins, having folded bioactive peptides displayed on the exterior of a hydrophobic core. However, PA self-assembly is often unpredictable and design insight is needed to control the properties of PA micelles from the bottom up. In this regard, we have studied several design factors. Peptide length was systematically varied using a heptad repeat PA to study headgroup secondary structure. For all PAs the addition of a C 12 tail induced micellization and secondary structure. PAs with 9 amino acids formed beta-sheet interactions upon aggregation, whereas the 23 and 30 residue peptides were displayed in an alpha-helical conformation. The 16 amino acid PA experienced a structural transition from helix tosheet, indicating that kinetics play a role in secondary structure formation. A DNA binding ""bZip"" PA derived from the GCN4 protein was used as a model peptide to explore the relationship between self-assembly and activity. Micellization induced secondary structure and stabilized a native-like binding orientation, however, the PAs had a strong affinity for all DNA sequences and were not able to recognize the specific target sequence of GCN4. Because of the propensity of PAs to form cylindrical micelles, their use is limited in applications where small spherical micelles are desired. We developed a platform method for controlling the self-assembly of biofunctional PAs into spherical 50 nm particles using dendrimers as shape-directing scaffolds. This templating approach resulted in biocompatible, stable protein-like assemblies displaying peptides with native secondary structure and biofunctionality. The final property studied was micelle stability. Studies of two bZip peptide sequences with di-C16 tails showed that a short 7 amino acid coiled-coil nucleation sequence imparted a significant amount of stability to the micelles, leading to an order of magnitude decrease in the dissociation rate. A bZip peptide with a palmitic acid tail had the same CMC and dissocation kinetics as with a fluorodecanoic acid tail, indicating that short fluorocarbon tails can be investigated in PA design over longer hydrocarbon tails.",,,
1691,Incorrigibly and Invincibly Bachelor: The Unmarried Man and the Isolation of Individualism in Mid-Twentieth-Century U.S. Fiction,"Drawing on theories of masculinity, whiteness, and American liberalism, ""Incorrigibly and Invincibly Bachelor"" is an interdisciplinary study of mid-twentieth-century U.S. literary, media, consumer, and erotic cultures. Its point of entry is a range of narratives across multiple genres by major U.S. authors that feature bachelor protagonists and are pre-occupied with the threat of market-driven de-individuation. Although bachelors are rarely considered resistant, countercultural figures, given the centrality of marriage to the economic and social life of the 1940s and 1950s, these bachelor-centered texts must be seen as subversive critiques not merely of domesticity, but of a variety of cultural practices, norms, and productions that effectively circumscribed a limited number of acceptable performances of identity. While there have been several comprehensive analyses of marriage in U.S. literature, very little has been done to address the potential cultural work being performed by narratives about bachelors, particularly in the mid-twentieth century. This is surprising in light of the marriage, baby, and industrial booms of the period, and ""Incorrigibly and Invincibly Bachelor"" uses the historical record as the background for an investigation of how its primary authors---Chandler, Fitzgerald, Faulkner, and Salinger---situate their bachelor protagonists in relation to several irresistible mid-century forces: crony-capitalism, the film industry, and mass culture. While it may seem counterintuitive, this project reads these bachelor fictions as queer protest fictions, insofar as the white, heterosexual male's willful self-removal from biological reproduction and its cultural instantiation in the American suburbs insults the logic of a mature, consumer-driven U.S. capitalism. These protest fictions must be taken seriously, as they reflect the frustrating marriage of innovation and impotence that has defined the history of U.S. liberalism---in brief, they are cultural critiques that fail to lead to structural change precisely because they abide by the market logic of the system they resist.",,,
1692,East Asian Financial Cooperation: A Closer Look at Negotiation Processes,"This dissertation examines the negotiation processes of financial and monetary cooperation in East Asia since the 1997--1998 Asian financial crisis, which have been understudied. The purpose of this study is to explore the various strategies and tactics that helped to shape particular agreement details, in order to provide more insight to our understanding of the dynamics of international economic negotiations. Since the conventional three levels of analysis of International Relations cannot tell which specific outcome may be selected, a problem of multiple equilibria results. I contend that negotiators' bargaining strategies and tactics can solve a multiple equilibria problem as they help explain the specific details of outcomes. This research uses the recent agreement to multilateralize the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMIM), with particular emphasis on the issues of members' financial contributions and vote shares, to analyze negotiation processes. Due to data inaccessibility problems and financial constraints, I chose to focus on five of the most influential players in the CMIM negotiations---Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. It should be noted that China, though it was an important actor in the CMIM negotiations, is not included in my analysis due to a lack of direct access to Chinese sources. Extensive archival research and in-depth interviews were employed to collect data. Process tracing was a method of analysis. My investigation of the CMIM negotiations reveals that the member states employed several bargaining elements to alter final outcome. States with a lower discount rate (a lower sense of urgency) and a more attractive best alternative to no agreement (batna) were able to walk away with more favorable terms than those with a higher discount rate and less attractive batna. Also, possessing knowledge about other actors' preferences or about issues being discussed (expertise) enhanced states' relative bargaining leverage. Countries took advantage of being a co-chair of the negotiation to turn the agreement terms in their favor. In some circumstances, countries strategically linked issues under negotiation to reap concessions from the others. Additionally, forming a coalition or preventing a coalition of other states from forming sometimes helped states achieve their objectives.",,,
1693,"Examining Traditional Television and Online Video Use in the New Media Environment: Understanding the Role of Audience Activity, Media Orientation, Generational Cohort, and Contextual Age","Viewers are increasingly accessing television and video content through the internet. Many networks now provide free access to television programs, while websites such as YouTube.com allow Internet users to post and view content via their computers. Some fear that television viewing will be replaced by online video use. However, little is known about viewers' motivations for accessing online video content, and the extent to which these are different from traditional television and internet motivations. Based on the uses and gratifications framework, motivations for viewing traditional television and online video content were explored. This study employed a survey among a national sample of US adults, and was informed by two pilot studies. Further, this study explored how online video recommendation sources relate to audience activity and media orientation. Due to the broad sample, generational theory was used to examine how one's generation may influence media use and whether traditional television and online video serve as functional alternatives. Finally, by considering the influence demographics, media use variables, and contextual age, models of television and online video use are explored. Results suggest that the information, entertainment, and social interaction motivations were associated with greater television use, while the entertainment/pass time motivation and information motivation were associated with greater online video use. Respondents indicated that most online video content is discovered from others directly sharing clips or links to clips, however this recommendation source was not related to increased use. Surprisingly, online video use and discovering content using keyword searching were associated by the ritualized orientation rather than the instrumental orientation. Slight differences with traditional television and online video use motivations among generational cohorts were identified. Perhaps surprisingly, contextual age dimensions had no relationship with online video use. However, regression results indicate that those who are unhappy with life turn to television or online video to feel less lonely. Moreover, those who keep in touch with friends and family view television and online video use for motivations other than companionship.",,,
1694,Scalable and Elastic Transactional Data Stores for Cloud Computing Platforms,"Cloud computing has emerged as a multi-billion dollar industry and as a successful paradigm for web application deployment. Economies-of-scale, elasticity, and pay-per-use pricing are the biggest promises of cloud. Database management systems (DBMSs) serving these web applications form a critical component of the cloud software stack. In order to serve thousands of applications and their huge amounts of data, these DBMSs must scale-out to clusters of commodity servers. Moreover, to minimize their operating costs, such DBMSs must also be elastic, i.e., possess the ability to increase and decrease the cluster size in a live system. This is in addition to serving a variety of applications (i.e., supporting multitenancy) while being self-managing, fault-tolerant, and highly available. The overarching goal of this dissertation is to propose abstractions, protocols, and paradigms to architect efficient, scalable, and practical DBMSs that address the unique set of challenges posed by cloud platforms. This dissertation shows that with careful choice of design and features, it is possible to architect scalable DBMSs that efficiently support transactional semantics to ease application design and elastically adapt to fluctuating operational demands to optimize the operating cost. This dissertation advances the state-of-the-art by improving two critical facets of transaction processing systems. First, we propose architectures and abstractions to support efficient and scalable transaction processing in DBMSs scaling-out using clusters of commodity servers. The key insight is to co-locate data items frequently accessed together within a database partition and limit transactions to access only a single partition. We propose systems where the partitions---the granules for efficient transactional access---can be statically defined based on the applications' access patterns or dynamically specified on-demand by the application. Second, we propose techniques to migrate database partitions in a live system to allow lightweight elastic load balancing, enable dynamic resource orchestration, and improve the overall resource utilization. The key insight is to leverage the semantics of the DBMS internals to migrate a partition with minimal disruption and performance overhead while ensuring the transactional guarantees and correctness even in the presence of failures. We propose two different techniques to migrate partitions in decoupled storage and shared nothing DBMS architectures.",,,
1695,A Low-threshold Analysis of Data from the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search Experiment,"Although dark matter appears to constitute over 80% of the matter in the Universe, its composition is a mystery. Astrophysical observations suggest that the luminous portions of the Galaxy are embedded in a halo of darkmatter particles. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are the most studied class of dark-matter candidates and arise naturally within the context of many weak-scale supersymmetric theories. Direct-detection experiments like the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) strive to discern the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei resulting from WIMP interactions with terrestrial matter. This is a considerable challenge in which the low (expected) rate of WIMP interactions must be distinguished from an overwhelming rate due to known types of radiation. An incontrovertible positive detection has remained elusive. However, a few experiments have recorded data that appear consistent with a low-mass WIMP. This thesis describes an attempt to probe the favored parameter space. To increase sensitivity to low-mass WIMPs, a low-threshold technique with improved sensitivity to small energy depositions is applied to CDMS shallow-site data. Four germanium and two silicon detectors were operated between December 2001 and June 2002, yielding 118 days of exposure. By sacrificing some of the CDMS detectors' ability to discriminate signal from background, energy thresholds of _1 and _2 keV were achieved for three of the germanium and both silicon detectors, respectively. A large number of WIMP candidate events are observed, most of which can be accounted for by misidentification of background sources. No conclusive evidence for a low-mass WIMP signal is found. The observed event rates are used to set upper limits on the WIMPnucleon scattering cross section as a function of WIMP mass. Interesting parameter space is excluded for WIMPs with masses below _9GeV/c 2. Under standard assumptions, the parameter space favored by interpretations of other experiments' data as low-mass WIMP signals is partially excluded, and new parameter space is excluded for WIMP masses between 3 and 4GeV/ c2.",,,
1696,Investigation of context-dependent biopolymer folding and assembly,"Within crowded cellular environments, biopolymers often interact with each other and with lipid bilayers. Some of these interactions are intended and beneficial, while others are not. Although it has long been established that the sequence of a biopolymer codes for certain intrinsic properties which define its bulk fold/behavior, it is also necessary for biopolymers to retain some plasticity in order to react to the environment. Moreover, in order to remain functional, the biopolymers must learn to distinguish the intended interactions from accidental interactions, and make wise decisions regarding whether or not they should react to the surrounding. Here we examined a number of independent systems ranging from small peptides to ribonucleic acids with the aim of understanding how environmental context modulates and even overrides the intrinsic properties of biopolymers. Based on computational and experimental results, we found that both thermodynamic properties (final fold, stability) and kinetic properties (folding rate, folding mechanism) of the biopolymer can be affected by the local environment. In addition, the exact effect of the context depends on the nature of the biopolymer as well as the nature of the perturbation and the locations at which perturbations occur. In the case of self-assembly/aggregation, context-induced effects (such as alternative folding of the monomer) could have profound consequences on the assembled product (such as the morphology, growth-potential and stability of the aggregate).",,,
1697,"Self-Assembled, Multifunctional Micelles Containing Therapeutic Peptide Amphiphiles","Peptides have enormous potential as therapeutic agents due to their ease of rational design and target specificity, but they are limited by low stability and their ability to reach their desired target. This work demonstrates that a membrane destabilizing peptide linked to a hydrophobic domain self-assembles and disrupts the outer membrane of cancer cells in vitro. The peptide amphiphile can be coassembled with PEG-lipids into small spherical micelles 11 nm in diameter. The PEG chain shields the peptide amphiphile upon incubation with cells in vitro. Overtime, the micelles dissociate and the peptide amphiphile is internalized. It then localizes to the mitochondria and induces apoptosis. The method put forward in this work, the conjugation of a hydrophobic tail and subsequent incorporation into micelles with PEG-lipids, could be used as a general method to protect and deliver a wide variety of peptide therapeutics. Peptides are also capable of stimulating an immune response but are generally weak immunogens on their own and require strong adjuvants to be effective, prohibiting their use in clinical applications. Peptide amphiphiles concentrate peptide antigens into self-assembled micelles and can increase uptake by immune cells. In this work, a peptide from the model antigen ovalbumin is linked to a lipid-like tail and is shown to self-assemble into cylindrical micelles. The micelles induce a higher cytotoxic T-cell response in mice compared to the peptide delivered in a standard adjuvant -- incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA). This work also investigates B-cell epitopes and shows that assembly into cylindrical micelles stabilizes the secondary structure of peptide antigens more than small spherical micelles do. To improve the immune response to both cytotoxic T-cell epitopes and B-cell epitopes, toll-like receptor agonists were incorporated into peptide amphiphile micelles without significantly changing the structure of the micelles. This indicates that peptide amphiphile micelles can provide a versatile platform for the development of modular, multivalent peptide-based vaccines.",,,
1698,Teacher Study Groups: Toward a Model of Differentiated Professional Development,"While there is extensive research related to the study of high-quality professional development, the research shows that there is limited evidence to indicate that teachers are provided with this type of professional development on a consistent, ongoing basis. The research also suggests that there is a lack of adequate evidence to show that professional development is being successfully targeted to those teachers who need it (Porter, Garet, Desimone, Yoon, & Birman, 2000; Sykes, 1996). This dissertation constitutes a case study of one professional development model, teacher study groups, commonly called a ""differentiated"" model, namely one that is aimed to help specific teachers with distinct help. The differentiated model that this study examined is modeled after the teacher study group (TSG) concept. This study used survey and interview methods to collect data about the history of the model used during this study, the practice itself, the participants in the specific case, the participants' perceptions of their experience, and the process and outcomes, as well as other related features. A survey was distributed to all 22 regular, K-6 classroom teachers employed at one elementary (K-6) school that served as the subject in this study. Interviews were also conducted with the professional development provider, the site principal, and 4 classroom teachers. Results of the study were compared with previous work on the subject and suggestions for further research were made. In particular, implications for practice were offered with regard to the TSG model for use as a differentiated professional development program.",,,
1699,Direct Observation of Chemoreceptor-CheA-CheW Interaction Surfaces: Implications for Kinase Activation in Bacterial Chemotaxis,"A bacterial cell moves toward a beneficial environment and away from a hostile one in the process known as chemotaxis. This chemotatic behavior is mediated by the signaling complex which consists of a chemoreceptor, a histidine kinase CheA and a coupling protein CheW. The signaling complex regulates kinase activity, in turn controlling the rotational bias of flagella. The high-resolution structures of individual chemotaxis proteins involved in the signaling complex have been solved either by X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), yet the interaction between chemoreceptors and CheW is still unclear. Here we used NMR to characterize the interaction modes of chemoreceptor, CheA and CheW from Thermotoga maritima. We find that the chemoreceptor binding surface is located near the highly conserved tip region of the N-terminal helix of the receptor. The receptor interaction surfaces of CheA and CheW are located in similar hydrophobic patches located about 55A apart. This suggests one receptor dimer is required to occupy on each binding site of CheA and CheW and is antiparallel to P3 domain of CheA. Our NMR data and previous studies suggest that a rearrangement of each subunit of CheA dimer is important for kinase activation. Our results provide direct observation of receptor-CheA-CheW interaction and have implications for the kinase activation in bacterial chemotaxis.",,,
1700,Some Contributions to Multidimensional Scaling and Unfolding,"Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and multidimensional unfolding (MDU) are widely used methods for embedding a general square or rectangular proximity matrix into a low dimensional Euclidean space. They can be used both as a preprocessing step for further analysis such as classification or clustering, as well as a visualization tool in its own right (Cox & Cox 2001, Borg & Groenen 2005). Even though MDS and MDU have a relatively long history, new applications with larger and more complex data sets require the development of more powerful statistical methods. As high dimensional data are becoming commonplace in an increasing number of applications, dimensionality reduction and visualization tools such as MDS and MDU are more important than ever. Regularization methods provide powerful tools to deal with ill-posed problems and/or high dimensional data. The success of regularization lies in the balance between goodness-of-fit and certain model constraints. In this thesis, we develop a general framework for penalized MDS (Chapter 2), penalized supervised MDS (Chapter 3) and penalized MDU (Chapter 4). The proposed methods are very flexible in accommodating features/prior knowledge of the data, handling transformed, noisy and truncated data. We develop efficient numerical methods for computing solutions to the penalized least square and penalized likelihood. We adopt cross validation to estimate the tuning parameter. We investigate a particular form of penalty that shrinks objects towards their centers and accounts for the prior knowledge about clusters among objects. Extensive simulations indicate that penalized estimation provides significant better configurations than traditional unpenalized methods, especially when observations are non-Euclidean and/or errors are large. This novel penalized approach leads to a flexible alternative to the traditional MDS and MDU methods. This thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 1 provides a review of the MDS and MDU and discusses limitations of some existing methods. In Chapter 2, we present the penalized MDS formulation, numerical methods and simulation results. In Chapter 3, we present the supervised MDS criterion and demonstrate its potential as a tool for data visualization using the simulated and real data. In Chapter 4, we present the penalized MDU framework, numerical methods, simulation results and application to a real data set.",,,
1701,"Responsibility, Luck Egalitarianism and the Egalitarian Aim","Egalitarians take a just society to be one in which its members are equal. For many egalitarians, the commitment to equality is not absolute; some differences between individuals can be just. In particular, the Luck Egalitarian seeks to neutralize differences that result from brute luck, but allows differences for which one is responsible. This articulation of the egalitarian aim relies on a distinction between two forms of luck: brute luck and option luck. Brute luck engages the egalitarian's concern as something for which one is not responsible, whereas option luck, because it is luck for which one is responsible, does not. This work shows that the distinction between brute and option luck fails in its aim to distinguish those things one is and is not responsible for and so cannot be utilized as a means of articulating the aim of egalitarianism. It also explores an alternative approach the luck egalitarian might utilize to distinguish those things that do and do not engage their concern.",,,
1702,Design Methodologies for Optical Lithography Induced Systematic Variations,"Designing robust integrated circuits have become increasingly challenging due to the presence of process variations. One of the main sources of process variations comes from optical lithography, which is the primary technology used for patterning design layouts on wafers. Aggressive scaling of feature size and the postponement of next-generation illumination sources causes serious degradation of on-silicon printed images. As a result, severe pattern distortions may occur, even when various resolution enhancement techniques are applied. In this dissertation, we propose design methodologies to address problems caused by lithography process variability. At the circuit simulation level, we propose a non-rectangular transistor modeling approach that derives an equivalent device gate length and width for accurate postlithography circuit simulations and analyses. Only one equivalent device is built and it is accurate for both on and off modes. At the layout verification level, we propose a hierarchical lithographic hotspot pattern classification system that is both accurate and computationally efficient. We construct our pattern classifiers using support vector machines and use a layout density-based method for pattern characterization. Experimental results show that our method exhibits excellent predictive capability and complements the pattern matching-based methods very well. Last, at the postplacement layout optimization level, we propose an algorithm that detects lithographic hotspots in a given placement of one-dimensional gridded designs and applies local perturbation of cell locations to remove the hotspots. The hotspot detection system is constructed using machine learning techniques. Experimental results show that our method can effectively remove all hotspots while incurring negligible penalty on estimated wire lengths.",,,
1703,"Domesticating Vengeance: The Female Revenger in Early Modern English Drama, 1566--1700","This project examines the female revenger on the early modern stage and how this figure dramatizes cultural tensions about gendered identity in early modern England. Despite the tremendous critical attention early modern revenge tragedy has received, and despite attempts to read revenge in relation to gender, few scholars have offered a sustained reading of the female revenger. By focusing almost entirely on male revengers, studies of revenge tragedy have created an oversimplified narrative of the revenge tradition and its relation to conceptions of gender in the early modern period. I contend that female revengers on the Renaissance stage have a profoundly different relationship to revenge than their male counterparts, who are typically characterized as effeminate and self-alienated. I begin with the simple observation that female revengers of the Elizabethan period are able to channel the dangerous passion of revenge without experiencing any threat to their sense of self. My project tracks a shift in the gendering of revenge and charts the gradual disempowerment of the female revenger across the early modern period, relating the diminished rhetorical agency of the figure to shifting cultural ideas about the passions, heroism and the gendered body. I trace this female revenger from neo-Stoic translations of Seneca in the 1560s, particularly John Studley's reworking of Seneca's Medea, through plays from the 1580s and 1590s (Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy, Shakespeare's Henry VI tetralogy and Titus Andronicus, and the anonymous Arden of Faversham) and the Stuart stage (Shirley's The Maid's Revenge and John Ford's 'Tis Pity She's a Whore and Love's Sacrifice). I conclude the dissertation with Ravenscroft's rewriting of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus and Congreve's comedy, The Way of the World, arguing that the failure of female revenge on the Restoration stage demonstrates a shift in the perception of revenge from an 'effeminizing' heated and embodied drive to a rational, if amoral, masculine ""dish best served cold."" By highlighting the critically neglected figure of the female revenger and tracking its transformation from the Elizabethan era through the Restoration, my project challenges our understanding of both the revenge tradition and early modern gender.",,,
1704,Multiscale Effects of Long-Term Sequence Learning,"The focus of this dissertation was to provide further insight into how the motor system supports the representation of sequences over the course of extensive physical practice. In Experiment 1 (Chapter II), evidence for multiple time scales of long-term sequence learning was investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to quantify blood oxygenation level-dependant (BOLD) magnitude change over the course of an extensive training regimen. Functional change was measured using a novel methodology that incorporated the repetition suppression (RS) effect, which allowed for the minimization of performance confounds. A substantial portion of the motor system demonstrated decreasing patterns of RS with training, indicating that extensive practice leads to neural efficiency. Moreover, the primary motor cortex (M1) and subcortical targets demonstrated an increase in RS at a slow time scale, indicating that extensive practice also leads to neural specialization. In Experiment 2 (Chapter III), the differential roles of the left dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and the supplementary motor area (SMA) during sequence learning were investigated using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). A double-dissociation of sequence production error revealed that the left PMd supports the representation of sequences at a faster time scale, whereas the SMA supports the representation of sequences at a slower time scale. In Experiment 3 (Chapter IV), using fMRI, the neural basis of motor chunking was investigated. Motor chunking supports the integration of the individual sequence elements during learning in order to express newly learned sequences as fluid behaviors. The quantification of motor chunking was handled with a novel multi-trial community detection metric. A regression analysis of trial-wise estimates of motor chunking strength revealed that motor chunking is supported by the sensorimotor putamen. The results from these experiments are discussed regarding their involvement in the representation of motor sequences over the course of extensive physical practice.",,,
1705,"Size-Based Approaches to Modeling and Managing Local Populations: A Case Study Using an Artisanal Fishery for Giant Clams, Tridacna maxima","The size of an organism is one of its most immediately obvious characteristics, and many key physiological, ecological, and evolutionary processes scale with size. Size is also relevant in the context of size-selective harvest which is common for many organisms. Using size-based approaches I report new insights into the photophysiology and demography of giant clams, to inform management of size-selective harvest. First, I found that the photosynthetic performance (photosynthetic efficiency and relative electron transport rates) of symbiotic Symbiodinium in mixotrophic giant clams (Tridacna maxima ) varied as a quadratic function of clam size. Second, I modeled a size-selective, artisanal fishery for T. maxima at a spatial scale (the island of Moorea, French Polynesia) where the amount of self-recruitment is unknown. I collected demographic data from 12 sites on Moorea annually from 2006--2010 to construct a size-based integral projection model (IPM) with a mix of self-recruitment and external recruitment. The IPM results indicated that in the worst case scenario, the population of giant clams on Moorea will exhibit a 7% decline in abundance under the present-day fishing mortality rate if it has 0% self-recruitment, but will increase exponentially if it has 100% self-recruitment. Fishing mortality decreased the projected population abundance. Finally, I evaluated the use of minimum size limits to optimize annual harvest across all possible amounts of self-recruitment in a local population of giant clams. I used the IPM to project harvest for combinations of minimum size limit and self-recruitment ranging from 0--100% of total recruitment. A single near-optimal size limit of 135 mm resulted in maximum or near-maximum harvest across the range of self-recruitment. A single near-optimum size limit can be applied for organisms with a variety of different life history characteristics unless a local population exhibits exponential decline. Overall, I found that the local population of giant clams on Moorea likely can support the present-day fishing mortality rate, and that size limits can optimize or nearly optimize harvest of local populations. My work indicates that populations can be modeled and managed at the local population scale in the face of uncertainty regarding the amount of self-recruitment.",,,
1706,"Design, Fabrication and Characterization of III-Nitride Based Solar Cells","Solar energy represents a vast potential clean, cheap energy. Harnessing this vast source of energy in an economical way such that it can compete with conventional fossil fuels is not a trivial matter. Current state-of-the-art solar cells are triple junction devices based on GaP/InGaAs/Ge or InGaP/GaAs/InGaAs technologies, with conversion efficiencies of over 40%. To increase the conversion efficiency over 50%, it will be necessary to increase the number of cells in multijunction solar cells and to find materials with larger band gap energies than is currently attainable in the traditional III-P or III-As material systems. The III-N material system (including alloys of InN, AlN, and GaN) has several characteristics which give it key advantages over the existing solar cell materials. One advantage is the wide range of band gap energies available in III-N materials, which range from <0.7 eV for InN to 6.2 eV for AlN. This energy range spans nearly the entire solar spectrum allowing for design of devices whose absorption is matched to the solar spectrum for optimum efficiency. The III-N materials are also direct band gap and thus have exceptionally high absorption coefficients on the order of 1x105 cm-1 for GaN, which is an order of magnitude greater than for GaAs and several orders of magnitude higher than for an indirect band gap material such as silicon. While III-Ns are appealing, there are challenges for device design which are unique to this material system, namely: polarization charges at hetero-interface; high defect density; and significant lattice mismatch. This dissertation covers our work on the design, fabrication and characterization of III-N based solar cells. The unique design challenges are outlined and our progress on improving InGaN device performance is covered. We demonstrate p-i-n devices with fill factors of 75-80 %, V OC of greater than 2 V, and peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 80%. MQW solar cells are reported with EQE response beyond 500 nm and VOC of 2 V. Positive thermal power coefficients are also reported for both p-i-n and MQW solar cells. These results highlight the potential for future III-N based solar cell progress.",,,
1707,Solid state chemistry of platinum group and noble metal oxides: Implications for heterogeneous catalysis,"The substitution of precious metal ions in oxide hosts represents an attractive alternative to conventional metal-particle-on-oxide catalysts, potentially providing improvements in efficacy and lifetime while simultaneously reducing the loading of these scarce and expensive elements. This dissertation addresses a range of topics within a theme of understanding the solid state chemistry of platinum group and noble metal ions, with implications for their role in heterogeneous catalysis. To inform an understanding of the crystal chemistry of precious metal-substituted oxides, we begin by examining stoichiometric complex oxide compounds of isoelectronic Au3+ and Pd2+. La4LiAuO8 and La2BaPdO5 display exceptional resistance towards thermal dissociation and chemical reduction, serving as model compounds for understanding the crystal chemical conditions that stabilize these oxophobic elements in oxide environments. This understanding is further borne out in a neutron powder diffraction study of La4LiAuO8 -- the first such study of a stoichiometric (rather than lightly substituted) oxide compound with gold. Recent interest in platinum group metal- (PGM) substitution has been stimulated by findings that certain substituted complex oxides can reversibly extrude and reincorporate the PGM in response to redox changes in the atmosphere to which they are exposed. Of the PGM-substituted complex oxides studied, almost all have been perovskites. Here we present an investigation of Pd 2+/Pd0 redox cycling in a non-perovskite host, hexagonal YMnO3-type YMn0:5Fe0:5O3. YMn0.5Fe 0.5-xPdxO3-delta is only modestly tolerant to removal and redistribution of Pd2+; after only a few cycle cycles PdO is formed, rather than Pd2+ being reintegrated into the host. The final study presented here is a computational investigation of electronic structural features in compounds spanning the range of formal oxidation states adopted by gold in extended solids. Guided by the well-established importance of the position at which the transition element d band is centered (relative to the Fermi energy), we find an absence of any correlation between the charge on or oxidation state of Au and the position of the Au 5d-band center. Instead of correlating with the Au charge or oxidation state, the location of the d-band center shows a strong dependence on the degree of its filling.",,,
1708,Pharmacodynamics of Pseudopterosin A Interaction with Adenosine A2B Receptors in Stimulation of Cell Proliferation,"Pseudopterosins are known anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial agents, isolated from the soft coral, Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae. This study implicates pseudopterosins as activators of cell proliferation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), a cellular model of angiogenesis. A hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD) formulation of pseudopterosin A (PsA) elicited a 25% increase in cell proliferation (EC50 = 1.34 x10-8 M) in growth factor depleted HUVEC lines. This constitutes a >200 fold increase in potency over DMSO formulations. This increase in specific activity of the drug may result from constraints placed upon PsA orientation in HPbetaCD allowing for more efficient presentation to the receptor. This study demonstrates that the effect of PsA is mediated through inhibition of adenosine A2B receptors which leads to decreased synthesis of cAMP and that this effect can be reversed with a selective A 2 agonist, CV-1808. In addition, evidence is presented that PsA can induce protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation which has been shown to activate proliferation via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Collectively, this indicates that pseudopterosins are promising compounds for adenosine receptor mediated pathologies.",,,
1709,Culture and Emotional Suppression,"Two studies empirically examined cross-cultural differences in people's suppression of emotion and the accuracy with which they detect suppressed emotions in others. In Study 1, Asian-Americans and European-Americans' facial responses to film clips eliciting fear, amusement, sadness and disgust were video-recorded under different instruction conditions (i.e., suppress, freely express, no instructions). Four independent judges (two Asian-American; two European-American) coded the videos for expressivity on the target emotions. A marginal tendency for Asian-Americans to suppress their emotions (across emotion conditions) more than European-Americans emerged under the no-instruction conditions, but not the other conditions (Study 1). When coder culture and emotion condition were taken into account and participants' self-reported experiences of the target emotions were controlled statistically, Asian-Americans suppressed amusement under no-instruction conditions (as perceived by both Asian-American and European-American coders). Sadness and disgust were perceived less consistently by ingroup vs. outgroup coders across conditions. Fear did not produce any differences by either group of coders. The hypothesis that Asian-Americans naturally suppress emotions more than European-Americans was not supported. At best, such cultural differences must be qualified in terms of specific emotion. Study 2 involved a subset of the video-recordings from Study 1 (i.e., the emotion suppression videos) coded by hypothesis-naive groups of Asian-Americans and European-Americans who were instructed to identify the emotions of the targets in the videos. This study also examined participants' self-reported use of emotional suppression as a mediator of East-West cultural differences in ability to accurately detect suppressed emotion in others. The two groups of judges in Study 2 did not differ in the accuracy with which they detected suppressed emotions in others, and individual differences in the self-reported use of suppression did not predict accuracy in detecting others' suppressed emotions. In sum, cultural differences in emotional suppression appeared to be a function of the emotion at hand (e.g., Asian-Americans suppressed amusement more than European-Americans when judged by both ingroup and outgroup coders, but cultural differences are less clear for sadness and disgust, and no cultural differences emerged for fear). No cultural differences emerged in the ability to detect suppressed emotion in others.",,,
1710,"Contributions to the Understanding of (Aluminum,Gallium)Nitride - Silicon Nitride Interfaces","For the last decade Gallium Nitride and its alloys have been a popular topic in high power and high frequency transistors. GaNs main enabling material properties are its high breakdown voltage, high electron mobility combined with its high electron density (when combined with AlGaN), and its high temperature stability. In the early years of GaN development, a major breakthrough has been identified to be the introduction of SiNX passivation, which considerably reduced dispersion caused by surface states and led to a significant increase in output power density. The use of a gate insulator is also crucial in power electronics to minimize the leakage current through the gate. Understanding and optimizing these passivation and gate insulators are crucial steps along with optimizing the device design and structure in order to achieve greater performance and higher power densities. This thesis focuses on minimizing the interface state density of the SiNX / GaN interface by exploring the growth parameter space of the SiNX grown in situ by MOCVD. The SiNX interface state density is studied on Ga-polar (0001), N-polar (0001), and M-plane (1010) GaN material. The interface state density is measured by a Photo-assisted CV technique developed in this thesis that takes advantage of the type-II band alignment in the SiNX / GaN system. It was found that growth temperature had the largest impact on interface states for all crystal planes tested, where the highest growth temperature measured (_1200C) also had the lowest interface state density. On the other hand, defect density (from 1e7 to 1e9 cm-2) had almost no impact on interface state density. The effect of introducing a thin AlGaN or AlN interlayer between the SiNX and GaN is also studied in an effort to separate the interface states from Fermi level of the device. It is found that, while the interface states still exist, it is possible to use the polarization of the Al(Ga)N on Ga-polar GaN to raise the energy level of the interface states with respect to the bulk GaN so that they are not able to interact with the Fermi level. The opposite effect is shown for N-polar GaN, where the interface states are pushed into the midgap of GaN. Finally, the charge injection phenomenon, widely observed in SiNX, is preliminarily investigated. The emission and extraction of the injected charge is also studied. Additionally, field enhanced trap ionization was observed and briefly studied.",,,
1711,Between Black and Brown: Blaxican Identity and Experience in the United States,"This study explores the identity formation and experiences of 40 Blaxican, or Black-Mexican multiracial individuals in the United States. In-depth interviews and focus groups reveal that participants identify biracially as ""Blaxican."" Participants reject monoraciality and the common sense way of defining Blackness as defined by the one-drop rule of hypodescent. Participants are either bicultural or monocultural dependent whether they were raised in single parent vis-a-vis co-parenting households. The authentic expression of Blaxicanness is to identify as biracial and have a bicultural identity, therefore those that are monocultural work to incorporate both cultures into their identities. Parental socialization, peer groups, school and neighborhood contexts are the main socializing agents that shape Blaxican identities. I find that Blaxicans live in a borderlands space in between the social constructions of Black and Chicana/o identities. Black and Chicana/o peers police the boundaries around ""authentic"" half-Black and half-Mexican identity forcing Blaxicans to the borderlands where ambiguity, and contradictions are embraced. Blaxicans experience monoracial microaggressions (Nadal et al. 2011) that signal their non-normative, marginal and second-class citizen status.",,,
1712,Encoding Information in Coarse Grain Models for Self-Assembling Systems,"Self assembly phenomenon at different scales has inspired the scientific community to understand and design many physical and engineering systems. Making effective use of the fine resolution experimental data available today is not a trivial task. In this study, we develop and propose amicable analytic and geometric methods that helps to make coarse grained models for self-assembling systems. The necessary information that dictates the evolution of a self assembling system is inscribed in the various interacting components. This information is encrypted via the physical properties of the interacting components (e.g., their mass, surface properties etc), their interaction with each other (e.g., electro-magnetic properties, i.e., potential energy functions) and their local environment. We introduce two new tools (1) Local minimal structures (LMS) and (2) Programmable potentials for Hamiltonian systems. The topological tool LMS, helps us understand the effect of the morphology of the interacting components on the global topology of a two-dimensional self-assembly system with only short range interactions. The second tool, programmable potentials, helps us to obtain physical Hamiltonian models by coupling interaction properties and local information. This allows us to construct Hamiltonian models which encodes the observed qualitative behavior of a given system. The efficacy of LMS is illustrated with a coarse grained model mimicking previous experiments on the transition of the random network structures of cytosine molecule to a glassy structure over a gold surface. The identification of the LMS generated by the favored interactions not only provides a complete finite set of local structures possible, but may also provide an interesting viewpoint to understand the formation of amorphous and glassy (covalent) systems. Using the concept of programmable potentials, we define a new class of potentials that allow interacting entities to self assemble into a prescribed configuration governed by operational logic. We show how a sequence of logical statements that govern the system evolution, can be used to construct physical Hamiltonian model. We present several simple examples that illustrate this formalism. Specifically, we give examples from signal transduction, pathway selection and self-assembly of fifteen north-eastern states of United States starting from an initially disordered configuration. This approach is general in nature and can be used for other complex systems. Towards the end of the talk, we demonstrate numerically (using molecular dynamics simulations) the motility of Kinesin motor proteins. Kinesin are essential nanoscale motors found in Eukaryotic cell and are responsible for intracellular transportation, mitosis, etc. We develop a ten dimensional reduced order model that allows us to include the various (experimentally known) physical and chemical aspects of Kinesin motion in a simple way.",,,
1713,Investigations into the relationship between substrate recognition and conformational transitions during sequencespecific cytosine methylation by M.HhaI,"Modification of DNA is a process fundamental to all life that requires the precise balancing of specificity and efficiency. Methylation of cytosine bases within a genome is essential to the stability of archeal genomes, pathogen protection in bacteria, and multi-cellularity in eukaryotes and the enzymes that generate 5- methylcytosine are highly conserved from an ancient ancestor. Simultaneously, the cytosine methyltransferases have diversified towards thousands of different sequence specificities with high levels of discrimination for cytosines only within the context of the cognate sequence. The bacterial M.HhaI is a model for cytosine methyltransferases as well as the process of enzyme-promoted base flipping and modification. We sought to understand the chemical details of sequence specificity, conformational dynamics, base flipping, and the architectural strategy that underlies translating substrate recognition with catalysis in this important enzyme. First, the role of individual enzyme:substrate contacts were probed for their role in binding, catalysis, and the induced-fit closure of the catalytic loop via nucleobase analogs lacking bonding heteroatoms. Monitoring the rate of loop closure with a substrate lacking the base of the target cytosine demonstrated that base flipping preceeds loop closure and suggested base flipping as the thermodynamic barrier to Michaelis complex assembly. A massive difference in the contribution of individual enzyme:DNA contacts towards assembly of the ternary complex is observed. Similar disparities are observed in the contributions of individual hydrogen bonds toward catalysis, suggesting a segregation of the roles of the substrate contacts into discriminatory and base flipping contacts. These hypotheses are then demonstrated to be correct, as the individual contacts are shown to have profound differences in their ability to provide the energy to effect base flipping. Mutagenesis is used to probe the role of individual residues in coordinating base flipping and loop closure. Modeling and analysis of the transient state kinetic data is used to confirm that base flipping precedes loop closure and that the loop does not actively eject the base from the helix. It is shown that the conformational dynamics leading to base flipping and catalysis are co-ordinated across numerous residues, with individual components having modest contributions to each step. Finally, NMR spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetime studies, and kinetic studies are used to develop a more detailed picture of sequence-specific substrate recognition and the first observation of an intermediate along the flipping trajectory. It is observed that the enzyme utilizes discriminatory contacts to begin substrate recognition and disrupt the target base pair to initiate base flipping. Overall, these findings present the most detailed picture of sequence-specific cytosine methylation ever described.",,,
1714,Circumaurality (Listening around Sound): Representing Spatial and Media Contexts in Sonic Art,"This dissertation examines sonic art works that demonstrate the characteristic ways that sound is affected by its surroundings. Called ""contextual representation"" herein, this activity is found in soundscape composition and glitch music, as well as Alvin Lucier's music compositions and the sound installations of Robin Minard, Max Neuhaus, and Bill Fontana. This dissertation introduces the basic concepts and terminology necessary to discuss contextual representation as a single category and examines the boundaries of this category, justifying the placement of various works within or outside the category. Additionally, this dissertation describes the works of contextual representation listed above. This dissertation introduces four compositional aspects common to these works---stasis, nonsense, non action, and juxtaposition---and explains how they are used to demonstrate a context's characteristics. Finally, this dissertation describes and analyzes four of my sonic art works, which provide a practical demonstration of the concepts introduced here.",,,
1715,Networked Estimation and Communication with Minimalist Models,"We provide three examples to show that we can solve complex problems in sensor networks even with minimalist observation and communication models. First, we propose a scheme to maintain synchrony in a Time Division Multi-plexed network with minimal overhead. Each node estimates the offset in its clock phase with its neighbors based on the differences between the expected and actual times at which it receives communication packets. Using such estimates, the nodes adjust their clock phases every time they receive a packet and also adjust their clock frequencies on a slower timescale. We provide insight by analyzing a simpler ""averaged"" system and use simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm. Next, we consider the problem of localizing multiple events that are closely spaced in time, based solely on their Times of Arrival (ToAs) at different sensors. The challenge is to identify and group the ToAs belonging to a given event. The naive approach of trying all possible groupings suffers from excessive complexity. We design a three-stage algorithm to sidestep such bottlenecks. The simplification comes from the first stage, where we discretize the times at which events occur to reduce the set of event candidates considerably. However, some of these candidates are ""phantoms"" that arise because we do not know the correct groupings. We refine the estimates in a Bayesian manner and solve a matching problem on a graph to reject the phantoms and group the ToAs. We use simulations to illustrate the near-optimal localization performance. Finally, we consider the problem of estimating an unknown signal recorded at multiple sensors through an unknown dispersive environment. We parallelize the problem by solving it in the frequency domain. We first estimate the signal over small bands efficiently, up to a scale factor. We then estimate the scale factors by choosing the small bands to have significant overlap. We show via experiments and simulations that the algorithm is effective in reconstructing signals with ""moderate"" bandwidths. For signals with larger bandwidths, we demonstrate fundamental ambiguities in the form of multiple source signals explaining the recorded observations.",,,
1716,A Comparison Study of the Pedagogical Content Knowledge of Single Subject Mathematics Credential Candidates,"This descriptive study compares the entry-level pedagogical content knowledge of single subject mathematics credential candidates based on career status and undergraduate majors. Career changers from science, technology, engineering or math (STEM) fields are compared to first career candidates to see if they bring different skills and knowledge to the teaching of mathematics. This study also factors in the candidates' undergraduate majors---mathematics, STEM (non-math) majors, and other non-STEM majors---with the goal of uncovering any differences in the candidates' specialized knowledge for teaching mathematics. Using mixed methods---a qualitative written survey (N = 69) of the participants' educational and occupational background, a quantitative measure of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and in-depth interviews (N = 16)---the volunteer participants' common content knowledge (CCK) and specialized knowledge for teaching mathematics (SCK) were compared to see if preservice teachers had (1) differing perceptions in regard to decisions to teach and in regard to the qualities, knowledge and skills needed to effectively teach secondary mathematics; and (2) differing types of pedagogical content knowledge based on career status or undergraduate major. Rather than sharply distinguish PCK among different demographics, however, the data indicated more about how individuals, rather than groups of candidates, understand mathematical content, how they communicate the mathematics, and how they make instructional decisions at the beginning of their single subject mathematics credential program. The prospective teachers evidenced strengths and gaps in their CCK and SCK, but it does not appear to be defined by their career status or undergraduate major. The implications for credential candidates and Teacher Education Programs is that most candidates need to develop multiple representations for math concepts, make connections between mathematical concepts and procedures and link mathematical models with contextual situations thus building the specialized knowledge for teaching mathematics.",,,
1717,Cinnamon compounds: in vitro activities on Tau and protection of primary neuronal cells from oxidative stress induced damage,"Tau, a microtubule associated protein, stabilizes and maintains microtubule structure and function. Modifications in tau, therefore, can affect its interaction with microtubules leading to its dissociation and aggregation. In the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) tau has been found as abnormal aggregates called neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and has been considered as a hallmark of the disease. NFTs are composed of complex paired helical filaments (PHF) of hyperphosphorylated tau. Tau aggregation coupled with beta-amyloid deposition in brain has been observed in association with neuronal degeneration leading to memory loss and impaired cognitive functions. An aqueous extract of cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), a commonly used spice, was found to have the ability to inhibit tau aggregation in vitro and even bring about partial disassembly of already aggregated tau (PHF) obtained from AD patients. In the present study, we investigated the effect of two compounds, cinnamaldehyde (CA) and Epicatechin (EC), active components of cinnamon extract, on tau aggregation in vitro and their ability to protect hippocampal neurons from oxidative stress induced cellular damage, a major cause implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. It was found that CA and EC can completely inhibit tau aggregation in vitro. The interaction was found to occur between these compounds and the thiol groups of the two cysteine residues of tau, importantly, in a reversible manner. Further, CA and EC could protect tau from reactive oxygen species mediated oxidation and prevent subsequent formation of high molecular weight species. CA and EC were found to protect primary rat hippocampal neurons in culture from oxidative stress induced disintegration and death. Furthermore, impairment of insulin sensitivity and reduced glucose uptake in neuronal cells due to oxidative stress were restored to normal levels following treatment with CA and EC.",,,
1718,Revival and Antiquation: Modernism's Musical Pasts,"Focusing on the period from roughly 1870 until the start of the Second World War, this dissertation provides a reappraisal of the formative decades of the early music revival, as well as a reassessment of its position within the larger cultural landscape of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In situating the revival within this context, my project seeks to illuminate its rich connections with the artistic, literary, and intellectual developments of the time. By reframing the discussion along these lines, I wish to show that far from being an isolated retreat into the musical past, the revival of early music was in fact an integral and vital element of modern culture, closely connected to many of the progressive artistic and intellectual movements active in the decades surrounding the turn of the 20th century. After an introductory chapter that provides an overview of my topic, I proceed to a study on the evolving reception of the harpsichord in the 19th and early 20th centuries, using the instrument as an entry point for the examination of the tensions between the past and present. The third chapter focuses on two case studies: Gustav Mahler's 1909 ""Bach Suite"" and Fritz Kreisler's ""Classical Manuscripts."" The former work repackaged Bach for modern audiences, while simultaneously emphasizing the historical nature of the music. By contrast, the Kreisler works presented newly composed music as being the products of long-dead historical composers like Louis Couperin, Antonio Vivaldi, and Gaetano Pugnani. In discussing these works I look at how both Mahler and Kreisler shrewdly balanced perceived historicity with a desire for familiar appeal. The fourth chapter provides a detailed study of Arnold Dolmetsch's engagement with the Arts and Crafts movement around turn of the 20th century, particularly his relationship with William Morris and the creation of the ""Green Harpsichord."" In my final chapter, I look at the role that recording technology played in both promoting in shaping the sound of early music in the 1920s and 1930s.",,,
1719,The Effect of Video Self-Monitoring on Novice Special Educators' Implementation of Advanced Direction Instruction Reading Techniques,"Special education teachers often have limited opportunities to learn from similarly trained professionals because of the low incidence of some students with moderate and severe disabilities and the amount of classrooms serving these students per school district. Moreover, the long-standing shortage of special education teachers in the nation further limits these opportunities. In order to learn new practices or augment and improve current practices, these teachers attend in-service trainings outside of the classroom and school context. However, research indicates that this form of professional development is at least inefficient due to the lack of feedback on new methods from an outside trainer in the applicable context. This study examined Video Self-Monitoring, a form of performance-based feedback that has been used for professional development. Video Self-Monitoring provides teachers a way to get observation-based feedback on complex instructional practices without the continual presence of an outside trainer. To evaluate the effectiveness of Video Self-Monitoring, the study examined three teacher's fidelity of implementation of advanced Direct Instruction reading techniques, specifically, the precise implementation of instructor signaling and error correction procedures. Using concurrent multiple baseline across subjects and interval coding, teacher fidelity of implementation of advanced Direct Instruction reading techniques, levels of incorrect teacher responsiveness to student errors per session, and levels of correct student responses per session were scored for a four-minute period during a reading lesson, over a period of 4 to 5 weeks, or approximately 15 sessions.",,,
1720,Sacred Travels: Religious Identity and its Effect on the Reception of Travelers in the Eastern Roman Mediterranean,"There are two contradictory pictures of society in the Roman Mediterranean of the first through third centuries. One view presumes a universal set of cultural values and beliefs, freely drawn on by any residents within the Roman territories. The other considers the Mediterranean to be a world divided by local interests and competing ideas of community and identity. Both views, however, offer a static picture of an Imperial Roman society that underwent a sea change only after the Empire became Christianized in the fourth century. This dissertation offers a new assessment of these topics in order to help create a better understanding of cultural unity, community, and religious change within the Roman Empire. I focus this study on two essential elements of Roman society which cross these topics: travel and religious identity. In pursuing this investigation I employ sources which document the experiences of individual travelers in the Eastern Mediterranean. These sources range from firsthand accounts to intentional fictions and demonstrate the role of religious identity in forming attitudes of and towards travelers. What becomes quite clear is that not only did religious attitudes inform the purpose of travel and the choice of destinations before the fourth century, but also that they offered a means by which travelers could negotiate the communities with which they came into contact. Although particular practices and deities varied by civic community or within a city, ancient travelers relied on a common understanding of religious structures and practices in order to align themselves with the various communities of the Mediterranean. When evidence from the first three centuries is put alongside that provided by Christian pilgrims in the fourth and fifth centuries, it is clear that ideas of hospitality did not significantly change after Rome officially adopted Christianity. Although Christian ideology has often been considered crucial to religious and social changes in the fourth century, creating a ""universal"" Roman Empire, this study recommends a reassessment of this view. The travelers' tales I consider give good evidence for a current of universalism within the Roman Empire prior to the full literary expression of Christian ideology.",,,
1721,"The role of sex, the female reproductive cycle, and estrogen in the motivation for cocaine, food, and their relative value","This dissertation examines sex differences in response to cocaine, with a focus on how the female reproductive cycle and ovarian hormones explain the sexually differentiated clinical profile of cocaine dependence. Presented here are studies that examine the hypothesis that sex differences in cocaine seeking, including the choice of cocaine over a competing reinforcer, are explained by either the short or long term effects of ovarian hormones. Specifically, these studies examine the role of sex, estrous cycle phase, ovarian hormone status, and estrogen on several reinforcement measures with the following research aims: (1) determine if sex and estrous effects in cocaine seeking are present after long-term drug abstinence; (2) determine if the effects of sex and estrous generalizes to food seeking; (3) determine if there is an impact of sex and estrous on the negative effects of cocaine; (4) determine the role of sex, estrous, ovariectomy, and estrogen on selection between food and cocaine. It is demonstrated that the effects of sex and estrous are enduring, do not generalize to food, are impacted by both the positive and negative effects of cocaine, and the long-term effects of estrogen are critical for females selecting cocaine over food more often than males. Therefore, the results of these studies suggest that both the immediate and long-term mechanisms of ovarian hormones contribute to sex differences in a variety of reinforcement measures. These findings are discussed individually within the context of current literature on sex differences in appetitive responses as well as how the results reflect upon each other to inform future projects.",,,
1722,The sources of Greek alchemical inquiry,"This work argues that the presence of ""alchemical"" and ""magical"" material found in papyri dated to the third or fourth century CE must be related to the declining local aristocracy of the Roman empire and to their educated clients. Jacco Dieleman, Ian Moyer and mostly David Frankfurter, first described the Greek and Demotic Magical Papyri (part of the Anastasi papyri collection) as the work of Egyptian priests responding to the wishes of Greco-Roman aristocrats who traveled to Egypt in search of mageia . The conclusion of my work suggests two alternative modifications to the current interpretive framework: either (1) the Anastasi papyri were not solely the work of Egyptian priests but also of a social group of ""dependent scholars,"" men trained in Greek learning but economically dependent, and thus associated with a patron; or (2) from a socio-economic point of view, there was practically no difference between many late antique ""Greco-Egyptian priests"" and ""dependent scholars"" who used handbooks of recipes to maintain or promote the status of their patrons (alternatively the patrons could very well have used the books themselves). Persian philosophy (mageia) was a popular topic of study among late antique philosophers and we should expect ancient education to have generally accepted research on the magoi as a valid topic of inquiry (chapter one). A misunderstanding of the subject of ""magical"" study in turn pushed patrons to ask their dependent scholars for curses and divination (chapter two). Scholars (e.g. Apion ""Pleistonikes"") who were known as sorcerers were generally attached to patrons, involved in sympotic entertainment (esp. in the form of paignia) and in natural philosophy (chapter three). Comparing dependent scholars with each other shows that they read or wrote recipes that were considered to be magical by more established scholars (chapter four). The presence of paignia and of other performance-related recipes in the Anastasi papyri strongly suggests the kind of sympotic environment and of intellectual patronage referred to in the preceding chapters (chapter five). The same conclusion must be drawn a fortiori for P. Leid. and P. Holm., which are constituted of recipes for the counterfeiting of luxury items (chapter six).",,,
1723,Versatile Coupled-Ring Photonic-IC Filters for Microwave Applications,"Microwave photonic links provide low loss transmission of wide bandwidth analog signals by leveraging fiber-optic technology. In addition, microwave signal processing can be accomplished in the optical domain where widely tunable photonic filters provide versatile signal processing at center frequencies unattainable by electronic solutions. Recent developments in photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology has rapidly improved the design and fabriation of photonic chips, on which stable coherent signal processing circuits can be created. In this work, we utilize the active InP material system to provide on-chip optical gain. On-chip gain adds a high level of design versatility and tolerance. Using a coupled-ring geometry, high-quality bandpass filter PICs are designed, fabricated, and demonstrated. Near-ideal filter shapes with bandwidths in the few GHz range and up to 40 dB stop-band rejection are shown to be fully tunable in bandwidth and center frequency without degradation to filter characteristics. In order for a photonic filter to be useful, it must not negatively impact the microwave signal fidelity. Quantitatively, this signal fidelity is described by the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR). In order to investigate the impact of a signal processing PIC on a microwave link, a theoretical analysis of PIC SFDR is carried out. In particular, the noise and distortion characteristics of semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) are derived. A general model for PIC-limited SFDR is developed for signal processing circuits with arbitrary transfer functions integrating multiple SOAs. Using this model, the SFDR of coupled-ring bandpass filters is investigated, and design trade-offs are identified. The analysis indicates the possibility of high quality filters with SFDR in the 105-120 dB  Hz2/3 range.",,,
1724,Cholinergic Striatal Interneurons and the Midbrain Dopamine System Control the Learning and Unlearning of Procedural Skills,"Procedural skills (i.e., skills that are learned incrementally through trial-and-error) represent a huge and important subset of behavior that underpin many of the most fundamental aspects of how organisms survive and prosper. However, procedural skills are also thought to underly maladaptive states such as addiction. There is overwhelming evidence that once a procedural skill is learned, it is extremely difficult to unlearn. In this dissertation, we propose and test a biologically-detailed theory of how such skills are learned, and why they are so difficult to unlearn. The theory we propose in this dissertation is characterized by a number of key features. First, procedural skills are learned at cortico-striatal synapses. Second, cholinergic interneurons in the striatum known as TANs (i.e. Tonically Active Neurons) tonically inhibit cortical input to striatal output neurons, and thereby gate the learning and expression of striatal dependent behaviors. The TANs are driven by cells in the centremedian and parafascicular (CM-Pf) nucleus of the thalamus, which in turn are broadly tuned to features of the environment. Finally, the model assumes that learning at all cortical-striatal and Pf-TAN synapses is driven by a dopamine signal that is sensitive to action-outcome contingencies. We examine the ability a formal computational model based on these features to account for key results from two well known classes of procedural skills (i.e., appetitive instrumental conditioning and information-integration category-learning).",,,
1726,A Spatially Distributed Agent-Based Model for Exploring Tuberculosis Risk Factors in Kenya,"How might risk perception and risk factors influence the spread of disease? To answer this question, we must first understand how risk perception influences risk-taking behaviors that result in an increased susceptibility to infection. Risk factors classified as behavioral and medical also contribute to susceptibility. This research explores the dynamics of tuberculosis disease spread in West Kenya. Behaviors associated with tuberculosis are complex and driven by a number of factors as evidenced by the current body of knowledge. A literature review on the role of tuberculosis perception, with an emphasis on perceived causes and modes of transmission, highlights this fact. To encapsulate decisions, this research explores one behavioral consequence of risk perception: avoidance. The act of accepting risk based on some utility to interact with a known infected individual can, in some cases, be identified as risk attenuation. In other cases, an individual may have little control over whom they interact with and when. To explore how these dynamics may influence the spread of tuberculosis; an agent-based model was employed. West Kenya was chosen to test the model due to its increasing rates of newly diagnosed tuberculosis cases and the identification of several multidrug-resistant cases. HIV and tuberculosis co-infections are also of particular concern for health officials in Kenya and many other parts of the world. Avoidance as a way to reduce contact with infectious individuals did not show a favorable result in the simulated population, and additional experiments to explore the potential consequences of an increased stigmatization of the disease brought about by widespread avoidance further produced unfavorable results. Due to crowding, avoidance did little to reduce initial infections, yet a scaling effect was identified as a limitation. More favorable results were found when other risk factors associated with tuberculosis were reduced, effectively simulating a more resilient population able to fight off initial infection and transition to the infectious active stage of the disease. Finally, an exploration of better treatment compliance and the outcomes for a shorter treatment option showed the greatest impact on the simulated population. While education campaigns may be necessary to increase the overall understanding of tuberculosis within the population, efforts to strengthen the population against initial infection and furthering the development of shorter treatment options that improve treatment compliance will have the greatest positive impact on the population.",,,
1727,The Harmonic Pattern Function: A Mathematical Model Integrating Synthesis of Sound and Graphical Patterns,"The current landscape of parametric techniques for synthesis of digital sound waveforms and graphical curves and shapes is vast, but is largely an incongruous mixture of closed and highly specialized mathematical equations. While much of this can be attributed to the independent development of synthesis techniques within each field, upon closer examination it is clear that there exist common mathematical bases between the modalities. By pulling back into a broader mathematical context, it is possible to develop a language of unified audio/visual synthesis principles so that many of the existing paradigms, regardless of modality, can be understood from a single vantage point. This dissertation defends the thesis that a large portion of known sound and graphical synthesis techniques can be unified through a rational function of inverse discrete Fourier transforms and that symmetry, invariance under transformation, plays an important role in understanding the patterns that it produces. We call this newly proposed audio/visual synthesis model the harmonic pattern function. A survey of a wide assortment of historic mechanical and electronic devices and computational systems used for generating sonic and visual patterns in art and science reveals that their underlying mathematical descriptions are special cases of this new synthesis function. The contributions of this dissertation include the introduction of a simple mathematical function, the harmonic pattern function, capable of generating a wide assortment of both known and previously unknown patterns useful for sound and/or visual synthesis, a simplified notation for specifying the complex sinusoids composing such patterns, and a thorough analysis of general themes and specific instances of patterns producible from the harmonic pattern function.",,,
1728,"Examining Intra- and Interpersonal Variables Involved in Neuropsychological and Personality Assessment: Are Asian Americans the ""Model Examinees""?","The present project investigated the role of ethnicity, Asian American (AA) cultural immersion level, and examiner-examinee racial match on commonly-used neuropsychological and personality measures (Studies One and Two, respectively). As hypothesized, culturally-different responding occurred between European Americans (EAs) and AAs on neuropsychology and personality tests. Specifically, AAs received higher scores on the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) and Developmental Test of Visual Perception - Adult and Adolescent Version (DTVP-A) variables. Contrary to prediction, AAs also scored higher on efficiency-related neuropsychological variables, indicating that they were able to simultaneously exercise fastidiousness and efficiency for these tasks. Results also revealed that AAs and EAs responded differently on the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) and the Rorschach Inkblot Method. AAs endorsed more items related to anxiety, paranoia, and anxiety-related disorders on the PAI and provided more unconventional, Aggressive Content (AgC), and Cooperative Movement (COP) responses on the Rorschach. ANOVAs and Fisher's Least Square Differences (LSD) revealed that AA cultural immersion groups generally did not respond differently from one another on neuropsychological or personality tests. One exception was on the inanimate movement ( m) variable on the Rorschach, which suggested that more acculturated AAs experienced more situational anxiety while completing the task than enculturated, bicultural, and marginalized AAs. Last, examiner-examinee racial dis/similarity did not play a significant role in assessment as it does in psychotherapy settings. These studies propose that the neuropsychological and personality tests under investigation can be used with AA groups of varying cultural immersion statuses. Because the samples used in this project were limited to college-aged AA adults from the West Coast with a higher concentration of Chinese Americans and females, the results do not generalize to the broader AA population in the U.S. Future research should attempt to replicate these results with more diverse groups of AAs, including AAs of differing ages, education levels, geographical regions, genders, and socioeconomic statuses. On the whole, these results call for a more thoughtful and critical analysis from practitioners and researchers in order to promote the cultural sensitivity of the field.",,,
1729,Multicultural Supervision: Increasing Multicultural Competency Skills in Clinicians-in-Training,"This study examined the effect that supervision with a direct multicultural focus had on supervisees (participants). Specifically, the study focused on how supervision affected supervisees' perceptions of supervisors' multicultural competence and supervisees' development of multicultural skills. Supervisees' development of multiculturally competent skills was measured by the client's perception of supervisees' multicultural competence, supervisees' case conceptualization ability and supervisees' behavior in therapy sessions. To measure the supervisee's behavior in therapy, coders counted the number of statements made and questions asked by the supervisee relative to cultural factors. This experimental study is a one factor with two levels, within-subjects design. Fifteen doctoral students were recruited to be supervisees (participants). The supervisees were divided into four supervision groups that met on a weekly basis. The supervisees conducted three therapy sessions with 30 undergraduate volunteers divided into a control and an experimental condition. Seven advanced doctoral students volunteered to serve as student supervisors. Each supervisor participated in both the control and experimental condition. In the control condition, supervisors provided supervision as they normally would and participants conducted three therapy sessions with their clients. After this condition was completed, the student supervisors were provided with training on multicultural supervision. In the experimental condition, supervisors were instructed to initiate a conversation on multicultural counseling and ask three questions that directly focused on cultural factors in case conceptualization. All supervision sessions and therapy sessions were videotaped. Trained doctoral student coders observed the therapy sessions and recorded the frequency of participants making statements and/or asking questions pertaining to culture. Participants were asked to fill out a form evaluating their supervisor's multicultural competence and asked to complete a case conceptualization at the end of the third session in each condition. Trained undergraduate raters reviewed participants' case conceptualizations. Clients were asked to complete a form to evaluate the supervisees' multicultural competence. Results showed that: 1) supervisors were perceived to be more culturally aware when there was a direct multicultural focus compared to when there was not a direct multicultural focus in supervision, and 2) there were no significant differences in participants' case conceptualization ability, clients' perceptions of participants' multicultural competence, participants' perception of supervisors' cultural sensitivity or skills, and the mean number of participants' behavior in sessions across the two conditions. Implications for research and training are discussed.",,,
